The Shah Kuh Formation of the Khur area (Central Iran) consists of predominantly micritic, thick-bedded shallow-water carbonates, which are rich in orbitolinid foraminifera and rudists. It represents a late(est) Barremian-Early Aptian carbonate platform and overlies Upper Jurassic-Barremian continental and marginal marine sediments (Chah Palang and Noqreh formations); it is overlain by basinal deposits of the Upper Aptian-Upper Albian Bazyab Formation.

Metre-scale karst depressions and iron crusts at the top of the formation provide evidence for a major pre-Haftoman Formation karstification. However, this event is unrelated to the Shah Kuh Formation as the lateral tracing of the unconformity shows that it postdates both the Upper Aptian-Upper Albian Bazyab Formation and the Upper Albian-Cenomanian Debarsu Formation (Wilmsen et al, 2010b, 2011).

Filamentous bindstones form small patches and layers in the upper part of the Shah Kuh Formation at Iraj. Similar microbial microfacies types have been widely recognized in Early Aptian carbonate platforms of the Tethys, many of which have been attributed to Bacinella irregularis and Lithocodium aggregatum (Rameil et al, 2010; Bover-Arnal et al, 2011).

The absence of gravitationally redeposited sediments rules out a steep slope and there is also no evidence of a rim at the outer platform (as in the case of the Esfandiar Platform of the Tabas Block; Fürsich et al, 2003). Thus, a flat-topped platform geometry is inferred for the Shah Kuh Formation that developed during the Early Aptian.

According to palaeogeographic maps (Barrier and Vrielynck, 2008), both domains were separated by a few thousands of kilometres of open Neotethyan ocean.

However, it appears that the Shah Kuh Formation is part of a general transgressive megacycle and that both, its base and top may be diachronous across wider areas of Central Iran. The Shah Kuh Formation is time-equivalent to an array of shallow-marine carbonate formations developing during the Late Barremian-Early Aptian in the wider area (the “Orbitolina limestones” of Northwest and Central Iran as well as the Tizkuh Formation of the Alborz and the Tirgan Formation of the Koppeh Dagh Mountains; ).
