Hence, the depositional model for the Lower Triassic Montney Formation in Alberta proposes a back-arc, semi-restricted shallow carbonate shelf with prolific benthic/planktonic shell productivity due to limited species diversity following the Permian-Triassic extinction event and limited terrestrial influx (varies locally)High benthic biogenic productivity suggests oxic bottom water conditions and possibly elevated salinity (to limit species diversity) that led to excess NaCl in the pore waters after deposition
