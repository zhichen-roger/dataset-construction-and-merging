Provenance of Lower Cretaceous Wölong Volcaniclastics in the Tibetan Tethyan Himalaya: Implications for the final breakup of Eastern Gondwana
south, was part of the northern margin of Greater India continental plate during Cretaceous time (Hodges, 2000, Fig
One key piece of evidence used in the reconstruction of the geotectonic evolution of Greater India is a major lithological change in the strata deposited around the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary, and the related appearance of Lower Cretaceous volcanic arenites
We discuss the implications of the new data for the sources of Early Cretaceous volcanism and the geologic processes affecting the northeastern margin of Greater India, and present a new geodynamic model to explain their occurrence.
Mesozoic strata exposed in the Tibetan Tethyan Himalaya (Gansser, 1964; Jadoul et al., 1998) (Fig
The southern zone is characterized by the presence of shallow-water (shelf) calcareous and terrigenous sedimentary rocks of Paleozoic to Eocene age (Liu and Einsele, 1994; Willems et al., 1996), whereas the northern zone is mainly dominated by Mesozoic to Paleogene deep-water sedimentary deposits of the outer shelf, continental slope and rise (Liu and Einsele, 1994; Hu et al., 2008)
Here we present results of a detailed study of Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastic rocks from the Gucuo locality situated northwest of Old Tingri town (Fig
Mesozoic strata in the Gucuo area are exposed in several thrust sheets (Hu et al., 2008)
They contain Upper Jurassic dark gray shales (Menkadun Formation) with abundant ammonites deposited in a shelf environment (Jadoul et al., 1998; Yin and Enay, 2004).About 45 m-thick Gucuo Quartzarenite (Fig
Ammonites, foraminifers and detrital zircon U–Pb ages (see below) suggest Aptian–Early Albian age for the Wölong Volcaniclastics (Hu et al., 2008)
The Upper Albian Dongshan Formation of the Gamba Group conformably overlies the Wölong Volcaniclastics (Fig
Data for spinels in the Tianba Flysch and Carboniferous–Lower Permian strata in Tethyan Himalaya are from Zhu et al
The compositional ranges of the detrital spinels from the underlying Gucuo Quartzarenite have low TiO2 value, very similar to those from Carboniferous–Lower Permian strata in Tethyan Himalaya (Fig
As this area represents a relatively stable marine environment, and no igneous activities are known from Early Permian to Late Jurassic, we suggest that detrital spinels from the Gucuo Quartzarenite most probably are derived from the same or similar ones to source rocks as those in the Carboniferous–Lower Permian strata in the Tethyan Himalaya.
The Th/U ratios of all 32 zircon grains with an Early Cretaceous age are N0.4 (0.5 to 4.4), indicating a probable magmatic origin
The most striking feature of the U–Pb analyses of zircons from the Wölong Volcaniclastics is the presence of Early Cretaceous age peaks (Figs
The youngest U–Pb age constrains the maximum depositional age to ∼119±2 Ma (1σ) for the Wölong Volcaniclastics, which corresponds to the Aptian on the time scale of Gradstein et al
It is interesting to note that the relative abundance of the Early Cretaceous U–Pb ages increases significantly from 3 percent in the lowermost part of the section (GC-H7), 13–14 percent in the lower part (samples GC09 and GC10) to 28 percent (sample GCL11) in the upper part of the Wölong Volcaniclastics
This increase in the abundance of Early Cretaceous zircons correlates with an increased proportion of volcanic detritus in the sandstones higher in the section.
The second zircon population in the Wölong Volcaniclastics is Early Paleozoic in age (479 Ma to 544 Ma; Fig
This Cambro– Ordovician zircon population has previously been documented in the Lower Paleozoic Tethyan Himalaya sequences by Gehrels et al
Precambrian zircons (77 percent of grains) from the Wölong Volcaniclastics are dominated by a broad cluster between 730–1000 Ma (peaks at 824 Ma and 978 Ma), with small clusters at 1060–1210 Ma and 2430–2730 Ma (Fig
Nine Archean zircons with ages ∼3.0–3.3 Ga were also found (Fig
Histogram and cumulative probability curve (left) and Pb/U Concordia diagram (right) of detrital zircon grains of Early Cretaceous age from Wölong Volcaniclastics.
Sample GCQ of 83 zircon grains from the underlying Gucuo Quartzarenite shows similar pattern of zircon ages to those from the Wölong Volcaniclastics, except that the Early Cretaceous zircon population is absent (Fig
The most prominent zircon age population from sample GCQ is Cambro–Ordovician (482–558 Ma).
The εHf(t) of the Early Cretaceous zircons (n=12, 15 percent of total analyzed grains) ranges from −1.5 to −7.2 with an average of −4.6
Theage distributionof detritalzirconsfromthe Gucuo Quartzarenite supports this interpretation showing age populations very similar to those obtained from older Cambrian–Devonian sequences in the Tethyan Himalaya (Gehrels et al., 2003) (Fig
The Wölong Volcaniclastics have a detrital zircon age distribution very similar to that of the underlying Gucuo Quartzarenite, but with the addition of an Early Cretaceous zircon population (Fig
Combined with compositional data together, we interpreted that the Wölong Volcaniclastics have a mixed sediment source, with material derived both from the Indian cratonic interior and from a new source of Lower Cretaceous volcanic rocks, which was situated south of the Gucuo locality along the northern Greater Indian margin.
Moreover, the Hf-isotope data indicate that the parent magmas of the Early Cretaceous zircons contain a significant crustal component and reflect mixing between magma ascending from the mantle and partial melts of the old continental crust (Fig
The presence of Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastic sediments in the Tethyan Himalaya was previously thought to reflect obduction of ophiolites to the north of the area during the Himalayan collision (Gansser, 1964)
1a), where they are interbedded with Upper Jurassic– Lower Cretaceous deep-water sedimentary strata (Fig
Their occurrence suggests that other Lower Cretaceous volcanic centers may have been present in the Northern Zone and similar volcanic centers may have existed further to the south, but, intra-plate volcanic rocks with 140– 120 Ma age are unknown from the Lesser Himalayan tectonic zone
Geotectonic model for the early Cretaceous volcanic event
These more than 400 m-thick succession deposited in delta-shelf environments are mainly composed of volcanic arenites and mudrocks, and have been biostratigraphically assigned to the lowermost Tithonian to uppermost Aptian (Jadoul et al., 1998)
1a), the 73 m thick Rilang Formation of Early Cretaceous deposited in deep-water environment is composed of gray shales intercalated with subarkosic and sublitharenitic sandstones that contain volcanic grains near the top of the formation (Hu et al., 2008)
The early- to mid-Cretaceous Tianba Flysch near Kangmar (Zhu et al., 2004) (Fig
The presence of Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastic rocks similar to the Wölong Volcaniclastics has been documented at several localities in western Himalaya (Fig
It may have started as early as Tithonian in the eastern Himalaya (Gibling et al., 1994; Nagy et al., 1995; Jadoul et al., 1998) and progressed westward along the northern edge of Greater India, and terminated during Albian time in the Zanskar Himalaya (Garzanti, 1993)
However, the Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastic sedimentation ended synchronously in the Late Albian (the planktonic foraminifera of the Rotalipora subticinensis Subzone, 101.7–102.4 Ma of Leckie et al
A deep-water hemipelagic or pelagic environment was established soon after the Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastic deposition in latest Albian time (R
Any tectonic model attempting to explain the origin of the Early Cretaceous volcanism along the northern margin of Greater India should consider: 1) the intra-plate tectonic setting; 2) its nearly linear distribution along the northern margin of Greater India; 3) the diachronous onset of volcanicity with westward migration, but synchronous termination; and 4) mantle-derived magmas mixed with melts of older, probably mid-Proterozoic crust as suggested by detrital zircon Hf isotopes.
Two different geodynamic hypotheses have been previously proposed to explain the origin of the Early Cretaceous volcanic event along the northern margin of Greater India: 1) it is a rift-related volcanism, triggered when Greater India begins to separate from the East Gondwana (Antarctica and Australia) supercontinent (Gaetani et .al., 1986; Gradstein et al., 1991; Garzanti, 1993, Dürr and Gibling, 1994); and 2) it is the product of a propagating hot spot and mantle plume (Zhu et al., 2004, 2007).
Early Cretaceous volcanic centers occur in a long belt (over 1500 km) paralleling the paleo-margin of Greater India, with mafic volcanism restricted to a few volcanic centers
Such processes are well documented from the Mesozoic rifting of the African and North American plates, involving cratonic breakup and rift basin evolution on both sides of the North Atlantic Ocean
However, the paleogeographic reconstruction of Gondwana in Jurassic time (e.g
Ali and Aitchison, 2008) shows that to the northeast of the Greater Indian margin, where the Early Cretaceous volcanic centers are located, was a deep ocean, most probably floored by oceanic crust
Studies of the Lower Cretaceous sedimentary strata in southern Tibet (Willems et al., 1996; Jadoul et al., 1998) and northern Nepal (Gradstein et al., 1991; Gibling et al., 1994) provide strong evidence that the Aptian volcaniclastic sequence is overlain by deeper-shelf shaly beds, with the Late Albian hemipelagic sediments being already deposited on the upper continental slope
The evolution of the western Australian margin documents extensive volcanic activity from about 155 Ma at Argo Abyssal Plain to about 131 Ma (Valanginian, Müller et al., 1998) in the Perth abyssal plain to the Naturalistic Plateau in the south (Symonds et al., 1998)
We consider the Bunbury basalt to be possibly correlative and to represent the most south- eastern termination of the Early Cretaceous igneous volcanic belt of the Indian margin (Fig
We propose that the geotectonic setting of the Early Cretaceous volcanic activity on the northern India continental margin can be explained by a leaky deep-seated fault model (Fig
This model with northwest propagating, extension-related deepseated fractures can account for all of the features of the Early Cretaceous evolution of the Tethyan Himalaya that we have listed above
We suggest that the opening of these fractures initially began in the eastern Himalaya in about Tithonian time, progressed slowly westward and reached the Zanskar Himalaya in the Late Albian
When Greater India finally separated from the Australia–Antarctica supercontinent and started to drift away, probably in Late Albian time (∼102 Ma), the igneous activity ceased as the continental extension ceased and the Greater India continental plate became free.
Sedimentological, stratigraphic, petrological, and provenance data from the Lower Cretaceous Wölong Volcaniclastics in southern Tibet provide evidence for a volcanic event which occurred inland on the northeastern margin of Greater India
The alkaline character of basaltic volcanic grains and their trace and REE elements, chemical composition of detrital Cr-spinels from the Wölong Volcaniclastics all suggest a “within-plate” tectonic setting for the Early Cretaceous volcanism
Hf-isotope data show that the parent magmas of Early Cretaceous zircons were produced by the mixing of magma ascending from the mantle with partial melts derived from an older continental crust.
The Early Cretaceous magmatic event was not related to a mantle plume orlarge-scale continentalrifting, butto theopeningof deep, crust cross-cutting fractures along the northern margin of Greater India, as the regional stress-field changed as a consequence of minor anticlockwise extension when the Greater India plate began to separate from the Australia–Antarctic supercontinent
Results described in this paper exclude analyses with ≥20 percent discordance, but greater discordance was accepted for the Early Cretaceous zircon grains because of the imprecision of the 207Pb/206Pb ages in these young grains
