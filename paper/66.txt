2 sedimentary rock (Smith Bank Formation, Triassic, Central North Sea)A
Here we report two occurrences of baddeleyite in a siltstone from the Triassic Smith Bank Formation of the Central North Sea, which we believe to be the first record of this mineral as a detrital phase within a clastic sedimentary rock.Baddeleyite (monoclinic ZrO2) was first described by Fletcher (1893) and named after Joseph Baddeley, a tea tycoon, who discovered it in 1892 near the small town of Rakwana on Sri Lanka
Well location, within the context of the supercontinent Pangaea during latest Permian, earliest Triassic.its only known occurrences are in a layered mafic–ultramafic complex on Rhum (Williams 1978); in a Scourian picrite dyke in the NW Highlands (Heaman & Tarney 1989); and in the contact metamorphic aureole associated with the Ballachulish Igneous Complex (Fraser et al.
Baddeleyite was found unexpectedly while studying the mineralogy of Triassic mudstones of the Central North SeaThe samples of interest come from well 20/25-1 (Fig
Baddeleyite was found in siltstones of the Smith Bank Formation which is Early Triassic in ageThe Smith Bank Formation consists of fine-grained, and virtually biostratigraphically barren, mudstones that have been previously described as monotonous (Deegan & Scull 1977; Lervik et al
It is overlain by the Mid- to Late Triassic Skagerrak Formation, which comprises three sandstone members (Judy, Joanne and Josephine) intercalated with three mudstone members (Julius, Jonathan and Joshua).During the Permian, the area that was later to become the Central North Sea formed a gently undulating, featureless, frequently evaporitic, basin (Fig
During the Permian, the area that was later to become the Central North Sea formed a gently undulating, featureless, frequently evaporitic, basin (Fig2)
At the onset of the Early Triassic, continental clastic sedimentation coincided with an increase in precipitation and the area became part of a southeasterly-flowing ephemeral fluvial system in which sediment was believed to be sourced from Fennoscandia,Fig
In the Central North Sea Triassic, where there is a lack of regionally-recognizable seismic markers to facilitate lithostratigraphic correlation, further investigation of the heavy mineralogy of siltstones may reveal data of lithostratigraphic significanceFurther work is continuing with this end in mind.
Detrital baddeleyite has been identified within an early Triassic siltstone of the Central North Sea using backscatter electron imaging and energy-dispersive x-ray analysisThis is believed to be its first recorded instance within a clastic sedimentary rock.
