Detrital zircon in a supercontinental setting: locally derived and far-transported components in the Ordovician Natal Group, South Africa
Abstract: U–Pb and Lu–Hf signatures of detrital zircon from conglomerates and sandstones of the Ordovician Natal Group, South Africa were determined using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
The basal conglomerates are dominated by Palaeo- to Mesoarchaean detrital zircon with εHf values from +3 to –4 with minor Mesoproterozoic input, indicating a proximal source in the Kaapvaal Craton and minor input from rocks of the Natal Sector of the Mesoproterozoic Namaqua–Natal Province
The sandstones are all dominated by a combination of juvenile Mesoproterozoic zircon and Neoproterozoic zircon derived from Mesoproterozoic rocks that were reworked during the Pan-African Orogeny
Several sedimentary sequences from former Gondwana with Neoproterozoic to Permian depositional ages show similar detrital zircon signatures
With a long and well-preserved record of clastic sedimentary rocks ranging in age from Neoproterozoic to Recent, the older of which (Neoproterozoic to Triassic) formed in a Gondwana setting (Catuneanu et al
Based on detrital zircon U–Pb and Lu–Hf data from Permian Vryheid Formation sandstones of the main Karoo basin in eastern South Africa, Veevers & Saeed (2007) suggested that detritus was transported from primary sources in central Antarctica to depositional basins in present-day southern Africa and adjacent parts of the Gondwana supercontinent in late Palaeozoic time.
The sandstones and conglomerates of the Ordovician Natal Group (Thomas et al
These rocks thus hold a potential key role for the understanding of the detrital zircon budget of Phanerozoic sedimentary sequences in SW Gondwana: if significant amounts of material from central Antarctica were transported to southern Africa in Permian time, detrital zircon in the older Natal Group should show age and Hf isotope characteristics significantly different from that of the Vryheid Formation sandstones
Furthermore, the depositional basin of the Natal Group was located close to possible sources in Antarctica and Mozambique, and it was deposited on a variety of basement rocks, including Archaean rocks of the Kaapvaal Craton and various igneous and metamorphic rocks of the late Mesoproterozoic Natal Sector of the Namaqua–Natal Province
Because the Mesoproterozoic basement rocks of eastern South Africa are very poorly constrained by published Hf isotope data, it has been necessary also to perform a pilot study on granitoid plutons that make up a substantial and zircon-fertile component of the regional basement.
The Namaqua–Natal Province is a Mesoproterozoic orogenic belt related to the amalgamation of the supercontinent Rodinia (e.g
It forms a continuous belt from the Namaqua Sector in southern Namibia and NW South Africa (Northern Cape province) to the Natal Sector in eastern South Africa (KwaZuluNatal province), with the between-lying area covered by the Carboniferous to Triassic Karoo Supergroup (Cornell et al
Its southern boundary is formed by the Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian Saldania Belt (e.g
From the end of the Pan-African orogeny in late Neoproterozoic time southern Africa remained within a stable supercontinental setting, Gondwana, until its breakup in Jurassic time (e.g
In this setting continental cover sequences were deposited, ranging in depositional age from Neoproterozoic to Triassic
In the Early Ordovician Period (480 Ma) South Africa was located at c
35°S (Torsvik & Cocks 2013) by the Late Ordovician Period (445 Ma)
Prior to this, in the Neoproterozoic to Cambrian Periods, the western part of South Africa was affected by the Saldanian orogeny, leading to granite emplacement (e.g
Deposition in the Cape basin lasted from the Ordovician to the Early Carboniferous Period (Tankard et al
2009); the Ordovician Natal Group is contemporaneous with at least some of this (Cape Supergroup) succession (Shone & Booth 2005; Tankard et al
Well-preserved cover sequences cropping out in South Africa for which U–Pb (and some Lu–Hf) data are available include the Neoproterozoic Cango Caves and Kansa Groups (Naidoo et al
2013), the Neoproterozoic Nama Group (Blanco et al
2011), Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks from the Saldania Belt (Frimmel et al
2010; Vorster 2013), and the Carboniferous–Triassic Karoo Supergroup (Veevers & Saeed 2007; Vorster 2013)
Veevers & Saeed (2007) argued for a distant (central Antarctic) source for late Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic zircon in Permian sandstones from the main Karoo basin in eastern South Africa (province of KwaZulu-Natal)
A distant provenance (Mozambique) has also been suggested for the Ordovician Natal Group based on palaeocurrent data indicating a source to the north and NE of the depositional basin (Thomas et al
The mainly maroon-coloured arkosic sandstones and quartz arenites, with interbedded mudrock and conglomerate units, of the Ordovician Natal Group were deposited on Archaean to Mesoproterozoic basement of the Kaapvaal Craton and the Natal Sector of the Namaqua–Natal Province (Hobday & von Brunn 1979; Marshall 2002)
1) the Natal Group rests on Archaean rocks of the Kaapvaal Craton, whereas to the south it rests nonconformably on the Namaquan (Mesoproterozoic) granitoids and gneisses of the Natal Sector (Marshall 2006)
It is generally disconformably overlain by the Carboniferous–Permian Dwyka Group of the Karoo Supergroup (Marshall 2006), except for south of the Dweshula High (Fig
1) where it is occasionally unconformably overlain by the Devonian Msikaba Formation (Hicks 2010).
A possible third cycle of sedimentation was initiated with the deposition of the Westville Member, the product of which might have been, to a large extent, removed by erosion prior to the deposition of the glaciogenic sediments of the Permian Dwyka Group (Karoo Supergroup) (Marshall 2006)
The positive εHf values for both of these intrusions agree with the generally juvenile nature of the Mesoproterozoic rocks in the Natal Sector of the Namaqua–Natal Province (Fig
In contrast, the six sandstone samples from the Ulundi, Eshowe, Dassenhoek, Tulini and Newspaper Members are all dominated by a late Mesoproterozoic to earliest Neoproterozoic (1150–950 Ma) age zircon (Fig
An additional, smaller, Neoproterozoic (700–500 Ma) fraction of variable size is also found in all of the sandstone samples
The late Mesoproterozoic to earliest Neoproterozoic fraction has an overall εHf range of +11 to –13 (Fig
The Neoproterozoic fraction has a more crustally influenced εHf signature, where 98 percent (148/151) of the zircons have εHf between +6 and –6
Minor Archaean, Palaeoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic fractions are also present in several of the sandstone samples
The detrital zircon age and Hf isotope distribution patterns in Figures 3–5 suggest that three main detrital zircon components are present in the rocks of the Natal Group: (1) Palaeo- to Meosarchaean; (2) Mesoproterozoic to earliest Neoproterozoic; (3) Neoproterozoic; with characteristic εHf ranges of +3 to –8, +11 to –13 and +10 to –11, respectively
grains on one hand, and all of the sandstone samples dominated by Proterozoic zircon on the other (Figs 3–5)
In addition to its dominant Archaean population the Ulundi matrix sample (SA12/29) also contains three, near-concordant, middle Mesoproterozoic to earliest Neoproterozoic zircon grains, which could be derived from the Natal Sector of the Namaqua–Natal Province where similar ages are recorded (e.g
The Namaqua Sector is therefore an unlikely source area for the generally juvenile, late Mesoproterozoic to earliest Neoproterozoic zircons found in the Natal Group (Fig
The bulk of the late Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian zircons have εHf values indicative of a derivation from juvenile, Mesoproterozoic material reworked during the Pan-African Orogeny, whereas the youngest grains recorded (<550 Ma) could point to a source in the Cape Granite Suite, towards the SW within present-day South Africa (Villaros et al
Veevers & Saeed (2007) observed detrital zircon patterns closely similar to those reported in this study in Permian sedimentary rocks in the main Karoo Basin of South Africa (Vryheid Formation) and in Dronning Maud Land, Antarctica
Their interpretation was that these sediments were derived from a common source in central Antarctica, which shed detritus to surrounding parts of Gondwana in the late Palaeozoic; and they inferred from Cambrian (meta)sediments with similar zircon signatures from the Welch Mountains, Antarctica and the Ellsworth–Whitmore Mountains that the same central Antarctica source was also active in the Cambrian period
However, apart from the Karoo, Dronning Maud Land, Welch Mountains and the Ellsworth–Whitmore Mountains, similar detrital zircon signatures have been reported from sedimentary rocks in many parts of former Gondwana and over a range of depositional ages from Neoproterozoic to Permian, including southern Africa (Fourie et al
Detrital zircon with similar age and Hf isotopic characteristics must therefore have been present over large surface areas in Gondwana much earlier than the Permian
This suggests either (1) that there has been a source feeding this vast area at least from Neoproterozoic to Permian time, (2) that these deposits are the result of recycling of older sedimentary sequences (the signatures thereby being a manifestation of the inherent resilience of zircon to physical and chemical weathering), or (3) that the various areas of Gondwana that fed these sandstone sequences are not sufficiently distinctive for them to be distinguished from age and Hf isotope data
As juvenile Mesoproterozoic rocks and juvenile Mesoproterozoic rocks reworked during Neoproterozoic time are a common Pan-Gondwanan feature (Fig
Combined with the results of sedimentary sequences with similar detrital zircon patterns our results show that sedimentary sequences dominated by juvenile Mesoproterozoic zircon and Neoproterozoic zircon derived from juvenile, Mesoproterozoic material reworked during the Pan-African Orogeny are a common feature of neighbouring areas of former southern Gondwana
Thus the Permian Karoo and Dronning Maud Land sandstones of Veevers & Saeed (2007) need not be derived from Central Antarctica (similar signatures were abundant in adjacent areas from at least the Neoproterozoic) but could be the result of recycling, or could be derived from one of several (equally) likely source terranes.
On the other hand, the stratigraphically higher sandstones in the sequence show uniform provenance characteristics, reflecting source areas with a typical Gondwanan signature comprising juvenile Mesoproterozoic material, and Neoproterozoic material derived from juvenile Mesoproterozoic protoliths reworked during the Pan-African Orogeny (Ireland et al
