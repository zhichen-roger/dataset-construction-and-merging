The isotopic investigation (Robinson et al., 2001; Huyghe et al., 2005) pinpoint the two major changes in sedimentary fill in the Neogene foreland basin at 9.5 Ma by the abrupt increase of the ƐNd (0), possibly due to local exhumation of the Lesser Himalaya by the emplacement of Ramgarh Thrust (RT)The facies analysis classify the Siwalik Group into seven facies association (KFA1– KFA7) in which the fluvial system changes from meandering to gravelly braided river system (Tokuoka et al., 1990; Nakayama and Ulak, 1999; Huyghe et al., 2005; Sigdel, 2013)
