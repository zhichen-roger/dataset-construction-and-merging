ABSTRACT: Upper Jurassic Fulmar Formation shelf sandstones of the high-temperature, high-pressure Franklin and Elgin Fields (South Central Graben, North Sea) contain abundant disseminated and concretionary ankeriteIn contrast, most Jurassic North Sea reservoirs contain only minor amounts of dispersed ankerite
In contrast, most Jurassic North Sea reservoirs contain only minor amounts of dispersed ankeriteDisseminated ankerite cement in the Franklin and Elgin Fields has a fairly uniform isotopic composition (d18O ø210 to 212.5‰ PDB, d13C ø23 to 25‰ PDB)
of Permian carbonates and evaporites that are a source of Mg21 during burial (e.g., Purvis 1992; Sullivan et al1990)
In the more northerly Brent Province, thick Permian evaporites are absent, and ankerite is only a minor phase except in close proximity to mudrocks (e.g., Macaulay et al1993; Kantorowicz 1985; Haszeldine et al
The South Central Graben (SCG) lies between these two regions, and Upper Jurassic reservoir sandstones in the Franklin and Elgin Fields (Fig1) contain significant quantities of authigenic ankerite, both as pervasive disseminated cements and as concretions of several decimeters to a few meters thickness
The reservoir unit is the Oxfordian-age Franklin Sandstone Formation, which is broadly equivalent to the Fulmar Formation in shallower terrace regions of the SCG (Price et al1993; Howell et al
The Franklin–Elgin Fields underwent progressive subsidence from the end of the Early Cretaceous, increasing during Oligo-Miocene time, and with maximum rates in the Quaternary (Fig4)
The Franklin Field was filled during the Miocene, but the Elgin Field was filled only within the last 5 MaMinor albite with hydrocarbon-filled fluid inclusions precipitated at an early stage of hydrocarbon emplacement
For example, calcitized sponge spicules contribute to high IGVs and underpacked detrital grain fabrics in Cretaceous sandstones described by Hendry et al(1996)
the ankerite contains no hydrocarbon-filled fluid inclusions, it most probably precipitated prior to hydrocarbon emplacement in the Franklin Field in the MioceneFor reasons discussed above, IGVs and standardized compaction curves are inapplicable to establishing an absolute depth of ankerite precipitation in the concretions
On this basis, Figures 5 and 13 suggest that ankerite was precipitated immediately preceding hydrocarbon emplacement, at about 140–1708C, from a fluid intermediate between Oxfordian seawater and the present-day formation waterAlthough carbonate fluid inclusions are prone to resetting (Barker and Goldstein 1990), the maximum Th values are less than the bottom hole temperatures in the wells (180–1908C)
In a regional review of carbonate cement d13C values in North Sea Jurassic reservoir sandstones, Macaulay et al(1998) documented a remarkably tight clustering of values from Upper Jurassic submarine fan reservoirs, with a mode at 29 to 212‰ PDB
(1998) documented a remarkably tight clustering of values from Upper Jurassic submarine fan reservoirs, with a mode at 29 to 212‰ PDBThe sandstones were bioclast-poor, encased in organic-rich mudrocks, and never exposed to meteoric water or pedogenic processes
The Franklin Formation sandstones pass vertically and laterally into marine mudrocks (Heather and Kimmeridge Clay Formations) and show no evidence for synsedimentary emergence and no record of meteoric diagenesis related to the baseCretaceous unconformityThey can therefore be considered analogous to Upper Jurassic reservoirs discussed by Macaulay et al
They can therefore be considered analogous to Upper Jurassic reservoirs discussed by Macaulay et al(1998), with one important difference—the Franklin sandstones contained abundant shell fragments
Although ankerite is a common minor component of many Mesozoic North Sea sandstone reservoirs, the Franklin sandstones contain unusual amounts of it, particularly as concretionsWe have interpreted the carbon in this ankerite as being derived equally from bioclasts and from organic acids (expelled from surrounding source rocks), once reservoir temperatures exceeded the threshold for decarboxylation and/or oxidation
1992) or significant mass transfer, either from adjacent mudrocks or from Permian evaporite–carbonate successions along episodically active basin faults (e.g., Burley 1993)Recent work suggests that deep-burial diagenesis is influenced by regional flow systems related to the generation and leakage of overpressure compartments (Haszeldine et al., in press)
In contrast, Middle and Upper Jurassic reservoirs in shallower parts of the Central and Northern North Sea contain minor disseminated ankerite and/or thin zones of ankerite cementation adjacent to mudrocksThe relative abundance of ankerite in the Franklin sandstones coincides with the extreme reservoir conditions (57 MPa, 1908C), suggesting a causal link.
