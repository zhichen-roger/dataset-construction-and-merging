Concordant detrital zircon dates from Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic continental slope and trough deposits in northern Greenland indicate Late Archean and Paleoproterozoic sediment sourcesSignificant numbers of dates are, however, discordant and, together with a few apparently concordant dates, give ages younger than the depositional ages of overlying fossiliferous sediments
The discordance pattern implies partial or total radiogenic-Pb loss during the Middle Devonian, possibly facilitated by postdepositional fluid movementSuch timing of radiogenicPb loss is supported by results from a novel modeling method, which indicate that the greatest statistical similarity between concordant and discordant detrital populations occurs when Pb loss is constrained to the interval of 380–390 Ma, i.e., long after deposition
The Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic evolution of northern Greenland (Fig1) records the development of a continental margin subsequent to the breakup of Rodinia
The sedimentary succession consists of six Cambrian through Early Silurian deep-water slope and trough megasequences formed by major turbidite systems, with cherts and shales deposited during periods of slower sedimentation (Higgins et al., 1991)Deposition is thought to have been concentrated in marginparallel grabens, which now form sedimentary units in Johannus Jenson Land and part of the Franklinian Basin (e.g., Trettin et al., 1991)
This study examines trough sediments from three Cambrian through Silurian turbidite groups.The Polkorridoren Group (Fig
1) consists of a 2–3-km-thick succession of Early to midCambrian turbidite deposits outcropping across northern Greenland, the deposition of which is thought to have been strongly controlled by trough-parallel extensional faulting (Surlyk and Hurst, 1984)Zircon data from two samples are presented here: 303569, a gray quartzite from the western part of the exposure; and 255628, a purple siltstone from the eastern exposures, which directly underlies samples from the Vølvedal Group and Sydgletcher Formations (Fig
The Vølvedal Group is considered Early to mid-Cambrian in age, based on comparison with graptolite-bearing outer-shelf and slope sequences to the southThe predominance of black shales and cherts indicates a period of slow hemipelagic sedimentation.
Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic geology of northern Greenland with sample localities indicated, adapted from Higgins et al(1991)
(1980) reported early Llandovery–age graptolites in underlying shalesOverlying turbidites of the Merqujôq Formation contain late Llandovery graptolites (Hurst and Surlyk, 1982), bracketing the Sydgletcher Formation within the Llandovery (443.4 Ma to 433.4 Ma)
Overlying turbidites of the Merqujôq Formation contain late Llandovery graptolites (Hurst and Surlyk, 1982), bracketing the Sydgletcher Formation within the Llandovery (443.4 Ma to 433.4 Ma)One sample 255626, a micaceous sandstone, is examined from this formation
Thrust sheets comprise far-traveled allochthons of clastic Cambrian–Silurian and Neoproterozoic sediments are overthrust onto shallow-water, predominantly carbonate, Cambrian–Silurian sediments (Fig1; Gee et al., 2008)
The youngest sediments overridden by Caledonian thrust sheets are Wenlockian (ca426 Ma) in age, giving a maximum age for the impingement of the orogen in this area.
(D) A concordant zircon from the Sydgletcher Formation (255626 zircon 40, 385 Ma), which returns an age significantly younger than the stratigraphic age (Llandovery: 443.4 Ma to 433.4 Ma) of the unit; the zircon is heavily fractured and alteredThe apparent age is younger than the depositional age and is thought to represent complete postdepositional resetting of the U-Pb isotopic systematics.
land, numerous quartz-calcite–dominated vein systems cut the Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic sediments, indicating that a major fluid event(s) took place in the regionCoupled with the stratigraphically restricted nature of discordance, this suggests that lateral fluid flow caused alteration in Vølvedal Group and Sydgletcher Formation zircon crystals
To the west, in the Canadian Arctic Islands, there is evidence for Early Silurian to Late Devonian fluid flow similar in age to that reported here for GreenlandDenyszyn et al
(2009) reported fluid flow as a mechanism for resetting the paleomagnetic signal in preferentially aligned Neoproterozoic Franklin dikesVug and Mississippi Valley–type deposit formation have been linked to long-distance shallow fluid flow (e.g., Morris and Nesbitt, 1998)
Both dates lie within uncertainty of the Devonian zircon within the Early Silurian Sydgletcher Formation.Discordance patterns in both Vølvedal Group and Sydgletcher Formation zircons converge toward a lower concordia intercept at 381 Ma
This date is younger than its Early Silurian host, implying radiogenic-Pb loss in the Middle DevonianWe propose that the mechanism for alteration of detrital zircon grains, in the Vølvedal Group and Sydgletcher Formation, was orogenic fluid flow associated with Caledonian orogenesis as disturbance is significantly later than deposition
event associated with uplift and exhumation due to north-south compression in the Late Devonian–early Carboniferous Ellesmerian orogeny (Soper and Higgins, 1991).Orogenic-driven fluid flow is recognized in many foreland basins and has been invoked as a mechanism for processes including porosity enhancement by dissolution or occlusion by cementation, and concentration of metal ores and hydrocarbons (e.g., Morris and Nesbitt, 1998)
