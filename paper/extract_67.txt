Broader petrologic and geochemical studies are required to constrain the controls and to define the patterns of temporal, stratigraphic and geographical distribution of authigenic chlorites in the Upper Cretaceous sandstones, in order to allow the development of effective models for reservoir quality prediction, which may effectively contribute to the reduction of exploration risks in the Santos Basin.The authors thank Petrobras for the access to samples and for the licence to publish this work, as well as the support of UFRGS, PUC-RS, and LHB-Endeeper
