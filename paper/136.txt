Cretaceous carbonate platforms are some of the largest and most widespread sedimentary units in the geologic columnThey developed throughout the Cretaceous Period in the Tethyan region
They developed throughout the Cretaceous Period in the Tethyan regionFurthermore, they have yielded significant amounts of the world's oil production and contain major reserves (Scott et al., Chapter 2, this volume)
Cretaceous platforms contain important information about changes in fauna, depositional facies, diagenesis, and climatic events, and they provide clues to platform growth and demiseComparison of different carbonate platforms from diverse tectonic and climatic settings provides a unique test to constrain basic controls on carbonate platform evolution, including effects of biotic changes, eustatic sea level fluctuations, variations in tectonic subsidence rates, terrigenous sediment influx, paleoclimates, and long- and short-term accretion and demise of carbonate platforms
This volume is designed to present examples and provide stratigraphic and depositional data on several Cretaceous carbonate platforms around the world for comparative purposes.Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/books/chapter-pdf/3837338/9781629810973_ch01.pdf by Nanjing University user
Cretaceous carbonate platforms differ noticeably from Holocene shallow water carbonate depositional settings (Figures 1 and 2)Climate, land-sea distribution, sea level, and fauna were different during the Cretaceous than they are today
Climate, land-sea distribution, sea level, and fauna were different during the Cretaceous than they are todayFor example, during the middle Cretaceous, the paleogeographic distribution was different (Figure 2) and continental patterns were more symmetric than today (Crowley and North, 1991)
For example, during the middle Cretaceous, the paleogeographic distribution was different (Figure 2) and continental patterns were more symmetric than today (Crowley and North, 1991)Sea level was 100-200 m higher than present, and about 20 percent of the continental area was flooded (Barron et al., 1980)
Therefore, Cretaceous platforms occupied larger shallow water areas and extended farther north and south of the 30Â° latitude than Holocene platforms (Figures 1 and 2) (see papers throughout this volume)However, ice-rafted deposits i n both the northern and southern hemispheres indicate seasonally cold climates
Economic Resources in Cretaceous Carbonate Platforms: An OverviewCentre deSedimentologie et Paleontologie Unioersite deProvence
Cretaceous carbonate platforms have great economic significance to humans and our quality of lifeThey contain approximately 16 percent of the world's hydrocarbon reserves (Carmatt and St
In addition, Cretaceous carbonates contain significant bauxite deposits (for aluminum), sedimentary iron, phosphate ores, and important secondary mineral depositsCretaceous carbonates are important sources of marble, building stone, and lime for construction
Cretaceous carbonates are important sources of marble, building stone, and lime for constructionAt many places in the world, Cretaceous carbonate platforms have played a significant role in the course of human history not only as economic resources but also as landforms that have influenced human actions.

John, 1986).Of the world's 36 largest "giant" oil fields, 8 produce from reservoirs in Cretaceous carbonate platforms, providing 12.9 percent of the estimated ultimate recoverable reserves of the world (Tiratsoo, 1986)Data on reservoir facies, porosity controls, trap mechanisms, and sequence stratigraphic relations have been published for 17 fields (Table 1); these serve as examples illustrating the various factors in reservoir formation
About 29 percent of the world's original petroleum reserves have been generated by Aptian-Turonian source rocks (Klemme and Ulmishek, 1991).Cretaceous hydrocarbon source rocks formed mainly during transgressions in Aptian, Albian, Cenomanian, and Turonian times
Cretaceous hydrocarbon source rocks formed mainly during transgressions in Aptian, Albian, Cenomanian, and Turonian timesJust over half of all middle Cretaceous kerogen was deposited within 45 0 of the paleoequator where carbonate-evaporite sediments accumulate (Klemme and Ulmishek, 1991)
Just over half of all middle Cretaceous kerogen was deposited within 45 0 of the paleoequator where carbonate-evaporite sediments accumulate (Klemme and Ulmishek, 1991)Five of the ten major source rock basins are within the Tethyan realm and are associated with carbonate platforms: Arabian-Iranian, Maracaibo, East Venezuela-Middle Magdalena-Llanos Oriente complex, Gulf of Mexico, and North Caucasus-Amu-Darya basins (Klemme and Ulmishek, 1991)

Campanian to MaastrichtianIn the central area of the platform, the regressive terrigenous facies of this age are called the Cardenas Formation (Figure 2).
The Cretaceous age of the El Abra Formation is indicated by the presence of abundant macrofauna, such as rudists and gastropods, as well as microfauna, such as nannoconids, tintinnids, globigerinids, and benthic foraminifera.Due to the prominant dolomitized horizons within the El Abra Formation, it has not been possible to define a precise faunal succession
In these wells, the formation is as old as Valanginian as indicated by the presence of Nannoconus sieinmanni (Basafiez et al., 1990), but it is claimed to be as young as Turonian in its type locality (Aguayo, 1978)However, it has been traditionally assigned as late Albian-Cenomanian on the basis of its fossil content and its stratigraphic position.
However, it has been traditionally assigned as late Albian-Cenomanian on the basis of its fossil content and its stratigraphic position.Figure 2 presents some of the more representative fossils of the El Abra Formation, with the most common among them being Nummoloculina heimi in the lagoonal facies and Caprinuloidea, Texicaprina, and Eoradiolites in the reef facies
These latter rudists indicate a late Albian to early-middle(?) Cenomanian age (Coogan, 1973, 1977; Young, 1984; Johnson et al., 1988, in Scott, 1990)In addition, other fossils have been reported in some wells, such as Colomiella recta, a tintinnid in Mexico that is restricted to the lower Albian (Trejo, 1980), and Texicaprina vivari of the middle Albian (Young, 1984).

Chapter 6 Sedimentation and Tectonic Subsidence During the Albian-Cenomanian in the Chihuahua Basin, MexicoLocation: From 103030' to 105000' west longitude and 28030' to 29045' north latitude, state of Chihuahua, Mexico
The Albian-Cenomanian sedimentary rocks deposited in the northeastern part of the state of Chihuahua are well exposed in numerous ranges forming scarpmentsThe interpreted depositional environment is an extensive shallow water ramp gently sloping seaward
The ammonite zonation established by Young (1959, 1966, 1972, 1974)for the Cretaceous in Texas and some localities in northern Mexico, as well as those established byChapa (1979) are used in this paper (Figure 2)
Stratigraphic cross section and depositional sequences of the Albian-lower Cenomanian formations between Sierra Chilicote and Sierra Santa Elena (Chihuahua basin)(After C
By Barremian-early Aptian time, sedimentation in northern Mexico occurred in a stable tectonic environment and carbonates and evaporites were deposited in large amounts (for example, Cupido, Lower Tamaulipas, and La Virgen formations)Similar carbonates and evaporites were deposited in western Europe (Ruffell and Batten, 1990)
This time of low tectonic energy ended in the early Aptian, and by late Aptian, clayey calcareous sediments were deposited in some regions of Mexico (Muir, 1936;Imlay, 1936; CCantu Chapa, 1968; Servais et al., 1986;Chiodi et al., 1988).
Within the Albian-Cenomanian strata of the central and eastern portions of the Chihuahua basin, three major depositional facies can be distinguished:Intertidal to subtidal limestones with benthonic fossils deposited in a platform ramp depositional setting
Lower Cretaceous strata crop out in discrete mountain ranges within a 70,000 km 2 area in southeastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, and northern Sonora, MexicoDuring the Cretaceous, this area was at the northern end of the Chihuahua trough, which extended southeastward into Mexico
During the Cretaceous, this area was at the northern end of the Chihuahua trough, which extended southeastward into MexicoThe geometry of the shelf margin facies is best exhibited by exposures in the Mule Mountains near Bisbee, Arizona, and in several ranges southward into northern Sonora: the Montes Canova, Sierra Anibacachi, and Sierra del Caloso (Figure 1).
Below the Morita is the basal Glance Conglomerate overlying Paleozoic and older basement rocksTogether these four formations comprise the Bisbee Group, which represents a major transgressive-regressive cycle
The Chihuahua trough began as a thermotectonic rift, initiated during the Jurassic opening of the Gulf of Mexico (Bilodeau and Lindberg, 1983)Backarc spreading related to subduction along the southern Cordillera extended the trough westward into Sonora and Arizona during the late Aptian and early Albian.

The most notable internal study was an integrated seismic stratigraphic-geologic study of Lower Cretaceous carbonates in west-central Louisiana by Lehmann et al(1985, unpublished report)
The Gulf of Mexico is a divergent margin basin formed during the early Mesozoic by rifting and extension of Pangea followed by sea floor spreading and plate migration (Pindell and Dewey, 1982; Pindell et al., 1988; Salvador, 1987; Winker and BuffIer, 1988)The Early Cretaceous in the Gulf of Mexico was a period of overall tectonic quiescence

Tectonic activity in the Early Cretaceous was limited to regional subsidence and local structuring related to movement of Jurassic salt (Lobao and Pilger, 1985)Early Cretaceous sedimentation in the Gulf of Mexico was characterized by deep marine suspension deposition in the central Gulf, flanked by broad areas of shallow marine carbonate deposition on passive margin continental shelves along the northern rim and on isolated rimmed platforms along the west and southwest rims (for example, Golden Lane, Valles, and Cordoba platforms) (Figure 1)

The LaSalle arch postdates Cretaceous deposition (Lawless, 1989) and had no effect on local depositional patterns.The Lower Cretaceous platform in this area can generally be characterized as a rimmed platform with (1) a broad, restricted, shallow marine platform interior or lagoon, (2) a narrow, well-circulated, shallow marine outer platform, (3) a well-defined platform margin, and (4) a fore slope that dipped gradually into the central

The Early Cretaceous carbonate platform enclosed the proto-Gulf of Mexico for a distance of more than 4800 kmIn places it was more than 360 km wide and up to 3000 m thick (Cook and Bally, 1975; McFarlan and Menes, 1991)
Carbonate deposition developed in at least seven transgressive-regressive cycles or depositional sequences (Figure 1) (Scott, 1990a; Winker and Buffler, 1988).The Jurassic platforms and Triassic rifting developed structures that controlled Cretaceous carbonate deposition (Salvador, 1987;Scott, 1984a).demonstrate the history of platform development in this area (Figure 2)

The Sergipe basin, in northeastern Brazil, has one of the most complete middle Cretaceous marine carbonate successions among the northern South Atlantic basins, spanning the late Aptian to early Coniacian intervalThe development of the carbonate sequences was mainly controlled by tectonic evolution and overall paleoceanographic conditions
The first is a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic platform system (late Aptian-Albian, Riachuelo Formation)Its main carbonate packages are oolitic-oncolitic-bioclastic packstones-grainstones and red algae (Solenoporacea) patch reefs, deposited in small shallow water banks associated with roll-over structures of the major listric faults
The other sequence is a carbonate ramp system (Cenomanian-early Coniacian, Cotinguiba Formation)It is mostly represented by a massive succession of deep water, fine-grained carbonates

In this region, Maastrichtian rudist limestone outcrops are observed mainly along the border folds belt, which lies geologically between the Taurus orogenic belt to the north and the foreland area to the south (Figure 1)Because of the oil potential in this area, the geology of southeastern Anatolia has been studied in detail by the Turkish Oil Company
The sedimentologic characteristics of the Maastrichtian units have been presented by Perincek (1979),Meric et a1(1985,1986),and Ozer (1992).

The Aptian series of southeastern Spain represents a good example of sedimentation in a mixed carbonatesiliciclastic marine platformAlthough these sediments are present over large areas of the Iberian peninsula, this paper deals only with the Iberic and Prebetic zones, close to the Albacete uplift, affected by block tectonics and gentle folds with good quality outcrops.
In this paper, we propose a model that tests the onlap fluctuations, relative sea level changes, and anatomic implications for the Aptian platform sedimentary sequenceThe interplay of siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentation regimes is also analyzed.
Aptian sediments are exposed in a 9000-km2 area, from Albacete to Caudete and [umilla (Figure 1)During Cretaceous time, this area was the southeastern part of the Iberic basin (an intraplate depression) and the northeastern part of the Betic basin (the Prebetic area), on the edge of a passive margin (Figure 2)

Albian-middle Cenomanian megasequence in the study area and the biostratigraphic distribution of the most indicative fossilsDotted bars: Iberian domain; black bars: Prebetic domain
The end of the large-scale megasequence was controlled by a regional tectonic event that began in the early middle CenomanianIt caused great changes in the geometry of the basins, especially in the Prebetic domain, where a new structural framework of troughs and highs developed (Martfn-Chivelet, 1992).
upper Albian to middle Cenomanian unconformiry-bounded megasequence, recorded in three different tectonic-sedimentary settings (Prebetic, Iberian, and Albacete domains), reflects a large-scale transgressive-aggradational progradational episodeFrom the study of the platform successions of this megasequence, three major evolutionary episodes can be distinguished: a poorly developed lowstand systems tract (fluvial clastics at the base of the sequence), followed by a major transgressive systems tract (marked by the development of four successive carbonate ramps showing a progressive retrogradational pattern), and finally by a highstand systems tract (where a ramp to shelf evolution occurred mainly by sedimentary aggradation of the shelf margin).
One of the most extensive transgressions during the Mesozoic occurred on the Iberian microplate during the late CenomanianIt resulted in a marked incursion of deep marine sediments comparable in Europe only to deposits in the upper Lias-lower Dogger.

The deposits corresponding to this sequence (upper Cenomanian-lower Turonian) crop out widely along the Iberian Range and have been the object of recent studies from various viewpoints: paleontology (Wiedmann, 1965, 1975), regional stratigraphy (Alonso, 1981; Floquet, 1991), and sequence stratigraphy (Garcia et al., 1985, 1987; Carenas et al., 1989; Segura et al., 1989)The outcrops are suitable for a detailed study because the dolostones are exposed along high vertical walls in karstic canyons and the underlying marls form smooth slopes
Toward the west of the Iberian Range, these deposits are generally covered by younger (Cenozoic) deposits in the Duero and Tagus basinsWell data are scarce

Cretaceous Carbonate Platforms andStratigraphic Sequences, South-Central Pyrenees, SpainFigure 6
Late Cretaceous carbonate accumulation rates in the Pyrenees were 100-500 m/m.y(Table 2)
However, they did not keep up with the Late Cretaceous long term relative sea level rise and thus retreatedTwo possible interpretations may account for this discrepancy: accumulation rates and episodic sedimentation
If volumes of sediment are considered (see Schlager, 1981; Simo, 1989b), the Pyrenean platforms would have had to double their sediment production (Figure 7) to keep up with Late Cretaceous relative sea level riseThis may have surpassed the maximum threshold for carbonate production
Three examples help to illustrate how episodic sedimentation reduced accumulation rates: (1) during sequence boundary formation, sedimentation was interrupted and the platform was exposed to subaerial erosion; (2) during the Turonian, shallow water carbonate production was reduced and sedimentation on the platform was mostly in deeper water; and (3) depositional cycles are bounded by flooding surfaces that indicate times of starved sedimentation on the platformThese examples indicate that there is a significant amount of geologic time in nondepositional surfaces and that carbonate production, once inter.rupted, has a "lag" time before beginning to produce sediment
Although none of these ideas are new to carbonate sedimentologists, they are clearly reflected in the Late Cretaceous Pyrenean platformsCarbonate accumulation rates played a major role in the aggradation and progradation of the platforms when both subsidence and eustasy were minor processes or when they canceled one another

As a whole, the Upper Cretaceous rocks demonstrate a complete transgressive (Cenomanian-early Santonian) to regressive (late Santonian-Maastrichtian) sedimentary megacycle ending in emergenceMore specifically, depositional evolution is polycyclic and directly influenced by sea level changes (Bilotte, 1985, 1992; Bilotte and Severac, 1989).

The formation of the Durancian uplift ("Bombement durancien") during episodes of the Austrian phase (Albian-early Cenomanian) led to the development of a carbonate platform (Figure 1), the extent of which varied during the Late Cretaceous according to relative sea level changes and tectonicsIts greatest extent was achieved in the Coniacian, a major transgressive episode.
Its greatest extent was achieved in the Coniacian, a major transgressive episode.A subsiding trough formed close to the carbonate platform, and a flexure zone typified by reefs or brecciated deposits separated the carbonate platform from the trough
A generally warm climate is proven by persistent rudist carbonate facies during the entire period studied (from late Albian to early Santonian)Carbonate platform sedimentation ceased only at the CenomanianTuronian boundary when a Tethyan (cooling?) event could have affected carbonate sedimentation (Philip and Crumiere-Airaud, 1991)

Reef development was periodically arrested by terrigenous influx, which was responsible for units rich in arenaceous foraminifera and the complete burial of the reef in the late CenomanianThe boundary between the carbonate platform and the basin was marked by mass gravity displacements, the different flows prograding basinward with varying morphology, orientation, and nature
IntraCenomanian emergence, which mainly affected the inner platform, resulted in solution of skeletal aragonite producing moldic porosity.Upper Turonian Carbonate Platform in a Perideltaic Trough Environment

Rudists (radiolitids and hippuritids) were the main components of the late Turonian buildups (here biostromes) of the Canaille-Subeyran massifCorals, red algae, and nerineids were also present, but scarce
This paleoecologic feature was quite different from the Cenomanian analog because during late Turonian time, the carbonate platform was continually affected by deltaic input, which changed environmental conditions (such as water turbidity and the nature and texture of the substrates)The Turonian delta axis was oblique to the external carbonate platform fringe (Figures 5 and 6).
The Turonian delta axis was oblique to the external carbonate platform fringe (Figures 5 and 6).Downloaded from https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/books/chapter-pdf/3837367/9781629810973_ch30.pdf by Nanjing University user

The youngest ammonoids stem invariably from the Acanthodircus radiatus zone (earliest Hauterivian) (Baumberger et al., 1907; Haldimann,1977; Wyssling, 1986)
Haldimann (1977) pointed to a general decrease in age of the oldest ammonoids in a proximal direction (until late Valanginian)This tendency is also indicated in the work of Wyssling (1986, figure 4), where the oldest ammonoids of proximal occurrences indicate the Saynoceras verrucosum zone (early late Val anginian)
This points to a time tra n sgr essiv e onlap of the Pygurus-Cemsmattli complex onto the sediments of sequence 54, which lasted from the middle early Valanginian to the early late ValanginianThe top boundary of this complex appears to be synchronous (earliest Hauterivian).
The top boundary of this complex appears to be synchronous (earliest Hauterivian).Strasser (1982) used the diachroneity of the base of the Pygurus-Cemsmattli complex, as well as lithologic correlation criteria within the Betlis Formation, to infer a diachroneity in the termination of platform growth

The high flux rates of siliciclastics and iron observed during this period may support this argument by demonstrating increased runoff from the continent during the Hauterivian.The condensed glauconitic and phosphate-rich beds that cap both Kieselkalk members document distinct sea level rises and the establishment of conditions detrimental to platform growth, similar to the PygurusCemsmattli complex in the early Valanginian-earliest
