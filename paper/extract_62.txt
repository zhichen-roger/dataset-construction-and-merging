Here we assess the redox mineralization of copper and lead selenide phases in the cores of reduction spheroids in Devonian sedimentary red bedsWe propose that the selenide mineralization occurred as descending meteoric fluids, supplied with selenium from Carboniferous coal seams, migrated through a major fault plane into underlying sandstones where localized, microbially-induced reducing conditions prevailed
