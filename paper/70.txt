Cenozoic sedimentary strata of the continental margin are well preserved in ocean basins and offer an important geological window for studying source-to-sink relationships between potential source areas and sedimentary basins over timeWe conducted coupled U-Pb dating and Lu-Hf isotope analysis of detrital zircon in fluvial sediments along northern and central Vietnam and sediment core in the western Yinggehai–Song Hong Basin in order to characterize the potential sources, investigate the sedimentary provenance, and decipher the crustal evolution processes of the source areas
30–25 Ma, 247–239 Ma, 441–414 Ma, 751– 743 Ma, 1876–1742 Ma, and 2700–2200 Ma, in contrast to the sediments from central Vietnam, which commonly exhibit markedly different age patterns with well-defined Silurian and Triassic peaks (ca244–234 Ma and 438–419 Ma)
The source-to-sink study demonstrates that both the Red River and central Vietnam materials have made important provenance contributions to the western Yinggehai–Song Hong Basin since the middle MioceneThe western basin has had constantly changing provenance since the middle Miocene because the contributions from these two source areas vary temporally
The western basin has had constantly changing provenance since the middle Miocene because the contributions from these two source areas vary temporallyThis integrated study also indicates that the southern Yangtze block and eastern Indochina block had a significantly different tectonic evolution history, as manifested by the age populations of major tectonic-magmatic events
nile crustal growth occurred in the southern Yangtze block during the Neoproterozoic and late Paleozoic to Mesozoic, while the eastern Indochina block is characterized by prominent crustal additions in the Paleoproterozoic.A long-standing goal of the geological community is to offer quantitative analyses of the ways in which perturbations on Earth’s surface are preserved within continental margin sedimentary sequences (Kuehl et al., 2016)
(2016b) proposed that during the middle Miocene, in addition to the Red River system, detrital materials were also derived from central VietnamIn many cases, it is hard to evaluate the relative influence of these source areas due to the lack of signature features and systematic studies.
Igneous rocks are abundant in the drainage systems and range from Proterozoic to Cenozoic in age (Fig2).
principal repository of detritus eroded from the Red River and its tributaries and is filled with a large thickness of Paleogene to Quaternary sedimentary rocks (Gong et al., 1997; Clift and Sun, 2006; Yan et al., 2011)Most of the sediments deposited in the Yinggehai–Song Hong Basin have been eroded from SW China and the Indochina Peninsula (Wang et al., 2014; Cao et al., 2015) and were delivered by the Red River system and the drainage system running along the coast of Vietnam (Fig
The Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the Yinggehai–Song Hong Basin can be divided into three periods, including the synrift stage during the Eocene to Oligocene, the postrift stage during the middle–late Miocene and a stage of renewed thermal subsidence from the Pliocene to Holocene (Rangin et al., 1995; Gong et al., 1997; Lei et al., 2011)Three successive deformation phases have been identified in high-resolution seismic reflection and borehole data, including left-lateral movement from 30 to 15.5 Ma, reverse slip between 15.5 and 5.5 Ma, and slow right-lateral movement after 5.5 Ma (Zhu et al., 2009)
These stratigraphic units range from the Eocene Lingtou Formation to the Quaternary Ledong Formation and are covered by modern sediments and underlain by a pre-Paleogene basement.In total, 11 samples were collected from both drainage systems and a borehole in the western Yinggehai–Song Hong Basin (Fig
grade metamorphic rocks (granulite facies) prevail in most parts of the catchments and are covered by Mesozoic continental red beds (Rangin et al., 1995)Early Paleozoic to Mesozoic magmatism is intensively manifested in almost all structural zones of the river basins, with complicated variations from source to sink (Hoa et al., 2008).
Early Paleozoic to Mesozoic magmatism is intensively manifested in almost all structural zones of the river basins, with complicated variations from source to sink (Hoa et al., 2008).TABLE 1

(Left) Measured Miocene to Quaternary sequences of borehole LO in the western Yinggehai–Song Hong Basin and the positions of the investigated sandstone samples(Right) Uninterpreted (A) and interpreted (B) seismic profiles show the stratigraphic sequence of the study region
Most of the Precambrian grains were characterized by inner cores and outer rings or light zones on the surface, indicating the influence of tectonic-magmatic hydrothermal events in their source areas (Cheng et al., 2016)Some zircon grains displayed a typical metamorphic origin with a low Th/U ratio (<0.1; Table DR11)
As manifested by the detrital zircon age patterns, the sediments from these drainage systems record a considerably long geological history from the Archean to the Ceno zoic (Fig5)
The Cenozoic zircon grains with age peaks between 30 and 25 Ma do not account for a significant portion of the total (Figs5A–5C) but directly represent the input eroded from the Red River fault zone (Fig
The Neoproterozoic peaks ranging from 751 to 743 Ma are the distinctive age signature of the Yangtze block (Hoang et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2014), which is consistent with the coeval tectonic-magmatic event in the blockThe associated Neoproterozoic granitic and volcanic rocks that occur sporadically around the Yangtze block were probably related to the pre-breakup history of Rodinia and the subsequent migration of South China between 1000 and 700 Ma (Li et al., 2003)
The associated Neoproterozoic granitic and volcanic rocks that occur sporadically around the Yangtze block were probably related to the pre-breakup history of Rodinia and the subsequent migration of South China between 1000 and 700 Ma (Li et al., 2003)Clearly, the Lo River and the main stream of the Red River are close to SW China, which has well-developed Neoproterozoic populations, in contrast to the Da River (Figs
Clearly, the Lo River and the main stream of the Red River are close to SW China, which has well-developed Neoproterozoic populations, in contrast to the Da River (Figs5A–5C)
The Archean to Proterozoic age peaks of ca1876–1742 Ma and 2700–2200 Ma are probably derived from the basement of the Yangtze and/or Indochina blocks (Zheng et al., 2006; Usuki et al., 2013) and also appear to have been reworked via sedimentary basins from the Songpan-Garze block (Hoang et al., 2009).
(2008) proposed that the Lo River joined the Red River after the middle Miocene (ca9 Ma) and contributed ~40 percent of the sediments to the main stream
In addition, the diverse age populations in this study might be related to the local erosion and recycling of the Miocene sedimentary rocks in the Lo River Basin (Fig1), because these rocks contain a wide range of zircon ages similar to the main stream of the Red River (Hoang et al., 2009)
1), more Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic zircons occur in sample location HUN-1, downstream of the junction of the Lo River and Da River (Fig5B), which indicate the provenance contributions of these two rivers.
By contrast, apart from the Gianh River, sediments from central Vietnam commonly exhibit markedly different age patterns compared to the Red River system, with relatively well-defined populations dominated by Silurian and Triassic age peaks (Figs5D–5H)
Both the Truong Son Belt and Kontum Massif of the Indochina block are characterized by widely distributed Ordovician–Silurian and Permian–Triassic granitic and metamorphic rocks (Carter et al., 2001; Roger et al., 2007; JLiu et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2015), which correspond to the widespread Caledonian and Indosinian orogenic events in SE Asia, respectively
More abundant Precambrian U-Pb ages are found in the Gianh River compared with other rivers in central VietnamThese zircon grains were probably eroded from the Paleozoic sedimentary rock in the drainage basin, because Precambrian strata with the relevant ages are distributed widely in the upstream catchment (Usuki et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016a)
These zircon grains were probably eroded from the Paleozoic sedimentary rock in the drainage basin, because Precambrian strata with the relevant ages are distributed widely in the upstream catchment (Usuki et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016a)It is noteworthy that Cenozoic zircon grains were first detected in the Ca River of central Vietnam in this study
It is noteworthy that Cenozoic zircon grains were first detected in the Ca River of central Vietnam in this studyThe coeval ages corresponding to Cenozoic tectonic activity are mainly located along the Red River fault zone (Fig
The coeval ages corresponding to Cenozoic tectonic activity are mainly located along the Red River fault zone (Fig2)
These zircons show the characteristics of a magmatic origin, with high Th/U ratios >0.1, indicating that central Vietnam experienced the Cenozoic tectonic-magmatic event resulting from the convergence between India and Asia (Tapponnier et al., 1986; Rowley, 1996).The Lu-Hf isotopic compositions of the detrital zircons add another dimension for tracing the source of the modern drainage systems
6C), this indicates that the protolith was potentially formed by the reworking of Proterozoic crust.In summary, the spatial heterogeneity in the detrital zircon U-Pb ages and the Lu-Hf isotopic compositions of these drainage systems, which correlate with the regional geological background and basement characteristics, reflect the petrographic composition distributions and formation ages in their drainage basins.
90–110 Ma) are not found in the borehole samples here, suggesting that Hainan Island has not been the source terrane for the western basin since the middle Miocene.The Paleozoic- to Mesozoic-aged zircon populations dominate the provenance record of borehole LO (Figs
The Paleozoic- to Mesozoic-aged zircon populations dominate the provenance record of borehole LO (Figs5I–5O), indicating significant provenance from Caledonian and Indo sinian orogenic sources
5) indicates that abundant Neoproterozoic zircons with peaks of ca760–730 Ma in these core samples should be interpreted as having originated from the southern Yangtze block through the Red River system, while the 970– 940 Ma zircon grains could be derived from the eastern Indochina block via drainage systems in central Vietnam
The older ages have been considered as the basement of the southern Yangtze block but are also possibly recycled from the Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in the eastern Indochina block (Clift et al., 2006; Usuki et al., 2013)Although the Lu-Hf isot opic composition of the detrital zircon shows that the Red River system is overlapped by counterparts from central Vietnam, the core sediments display some features closely related to both source areas, especially in zircons younger than 1000 Ma (Fig
ದ04	ದ03	ದ02	ದ01	0	01	02	03	04	05	06	River—upstream Red River; dominantly Neoproterozoic and Mesozoic ages compared with the early stage (Fig5N)
During the middle Miocene, the western basin received sediments from mixed sources of both the Red River system and central Vietnam (Figs9A–9B).
The late Miocene samples are close to the Lo River, Gianh River, and downstream Red River samples on the MDS plots (Figs8C–8D), which means the western basin was largely influenced by the sources of the Red River system and central Vietnam during the time of depos i tion
Compared to the early stage, the late stage contains more Neoproterozoic zircons with a peak at ca798 Ma, similar to the Lo River and Red River, and this suggests that more sediments were derived from the Red River system
(2015) proposed that both central Vietnam and the Red River played important roles in deposition of sediments in the western and central Yinggehai–Song Hong B asin during the late Miocene, which is supported by our resultsThe sediments of the western  basin were mainly derived from central Vietnam during the early late Miocene (Fig
The sediments of the western  basin were mainly derived from central Vietnam during the early late Miocene (Fig9C), and the sediment source changed to a mixed source from both the Red River and central Vietnam during the late stage (Fig
The sediment provenance in the western basin generally exhibits no significant change during the Pliocene, which is supported by the analogous KDEs (Figs5J–5K) and MDS maps (Figs
A rise in young NeoproterozoicFigure 8
Like the other sedimentary periods, the Quaternary was also partly affected by the central Vietnam source via the Gianh River (Fig9G).
This study shows that the provenance of the western Yinggehai–Song Hong Basin has not changed significantly since the middle Miocene (15.5 Ma), although there are still subtle variations in different depositional periodsComparison of the zircon U-Pb ages of the core samples from different source areas consistently demonstrates the continuous contributions from the Red River system and central Vietnam sources since the middle Miocene.
Comparison of the zircon U-Pb ages of the core samples from different source areas consistently demonstrates the continuous contributions from the Red River system and central Vietnam sources since the middle Miocene.Implications for Crustal Evolution of the Southern Yangtze and Eastern Indochina Blocks
Moreover, the Neoproterozoic to Mesozoic could represent the periods with prominent juvenile crust due to the large number of positive εHf(t) values for those zircon grains.The crust-building process involves two stages: (1) the extraction of primitive basaltic juvenile crustal materials from the mantle, and (2) remelting of the juvenile crustal materials to form felsic crust (Campbell and Hill, 1988; Wang et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012)
Obviously, Hainan has not been the source terrane for the western basin since the middle MioceneThe measured age distributions also suggest a relatively stable provenance during depo si tion, although the provenance of the western Yinggehai–Song Hong Basin changed during different depositional periods with varying contributions from these two source areas, reflecting evolving sediment dispersal patterns since the middle Miocene.

Juvenile crustal growth occurred in the southern Yangtze block during the Neoproterozoic and late Paleozoic to Mesozoic, whereas the eastern Indochina block is characterized by prominent crustal additions in the Paleoproterozoic.We wish to thank the Editor Aaron J
