Abstract— The Precambrian rocks of northern Botswana comprise poorly exposed igneous complexes, high-grade metamorphic rocks, as well as sedimentary sequences including mainly siliciclastic and carbonate rocksNew U—Pb SHRIMP data are presented for detrital zircons from siliciclastic rocks collected from the Shakawe area in northern Botswana
In contrast, Precambrian rocks are poorly exposed within the Kalahari Desert and therefore the age of crustal terranes in northwest Botswana is still poorly documentedClastic sedimentary rocks and related detrital zircons can provide powerful information on source regions (e.g
The aim of this paper is therefore to present new SHRIMP U—Pb ages of detrital zircon grains from siliciclastic rocks from northern Botswana and to considerthe implications for Proterozoic crustal evolu-The Neoproterozoic Ghanzi—Chobe Supergroup includes three terranes from south to north (Figure 1): Ghanzi, Rooibok, and Xaudum (Carney et at., 1994; Key and Ayers, 1998)
The Neoproterozoic Ghanzi—Chobe Supergroup includes three terranes from south to north (Figure 1): Ghanzi, Rooibok, and Xaudum (Carney et at., 1994; Key and Ayers, 1998)These terranes are tectonically bounded and their lithostratigraphic relationships are still under investigation
Older basement complexes in northern Botswana include: (1) Mesoproterozoic Kibaran-age granitoids (Kampunzu et at.,1999) and a bimodal volcanic sequence termed the Kgwebe metavolcanic rocks (Kampunzu et at., 1998)
Small bodies and dykes of Mesoproterozoic granitoids have been discovered at the southwest margin of the Zimbabwe Craton in eastem Botswana (Van de Wel et at., 1998), but their link with the Kibaran-age rocks reported here is not known(2) Palaeoproterozoic rocks with U—Pb zircon ages of c

Assuming that these ages represent the whole spectrum of zircon-bearing lithologies in the provenance area of the sediments, these data indicate the presence of Palaeoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoicbasement complexes in that regionThe basement complex exposed in northern Botswana is known to include rocks with U—Pb zircon ages fitting into these two groups and this provides support for the contention that the sediments were sourced locally
The absence within the zircon populations of Mesoproterozoic zircon within the age range 1.4 — 1.25 Ga (early-Kibaran-age event) is important to stress
This time range indicates that the siliciclastic rocks in the Shakawe zone are part of the Neoproterozoic Ghanzi—Chobe Supergroup sequenceThis age range is broadly similar to that for deposition of sedimentary rocks in the Katangan belt
Therefore, our data support the correlation between the adjacent Neoproterozoic Ghanzi—Chobe and Katangan basins (Kampunzu and Cailteux, 1999), and provide a good basis for a regional correlation of NeoproterozoicThis study on detrital zircon grains of an arkosic sandstone from the Shakawe zone shows that: (1) the maximum age of deposition of the sediments studied is c
These results are consistent with a local origin for the sediments because the pre-Neoproterozoic basement exposed in northern Botswana includes Palaeoproterozoic and late Mesoproterozoic rock assemblagesThe absence of both early Kibaran (1.4 — 1.25 Ga) and Archaean detrital zircons is
