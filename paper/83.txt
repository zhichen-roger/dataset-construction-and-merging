Detrital zircons from the sub-Grampian Group basement and the Grampian Group are predominantly of Palaeoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic ages with Archaean grains absent or rareIn contrast, the overlying Appin, Argyll and Southern Highland groups contain a significant contribution of Archaean detrital zircon grains, some of which locally preserve evidence for late Palaeoproterozoic overgrowths dated at c
Late Palaeoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic grains also show evidence for overprinting by a tectonothermal event around 1.0–0.9 GaThese tectonothermal events occurred in the source region before accumulation of the siliciclastic detritus
The analysed samples contained no definitive evidence for having been affected by a late Neoproterozoic (Knoydartian) event or of containing detritus derived from a source showing evidence for this eventThe overall age range of detritus, combined with sparse palaeocurrent data, is consistent with derivation from the Laurentian foreland, especially the Labrador–Greenland region
Mesoproterozoic detritus is consistent with derivation from the Grenville OrogenThe presence of a series of detrital age peaks in the late Palaeoproterozoic and early Mesoproterozoic (1.8–1.5 Ga), the paucity of mid-Mesoproterozoic detritus (1.4–1.2 Ga), and evidence for a tectonothermal event between 1.0 and 0.9 Ga is typical of the geological history of the Labrador–Greenland region of
The presence of a series of detrital age peaks in the late Palaeoproterozoic and early Mesoproterozoic (1.8–1.5 Ga), the paucity of mid-Mesoproterozoic detritus (1.4–1.2 Ga), and evidence for a tectonothermal event between 1.0 and 0.9 Ga is typical of the geological history of the Labrador–Greenland region ofKeywords: Laurentia, Dalradian Supergroup, U/Pb, provenance.
Siliciclastic-dominated sequences of largely Neoproterozoic age are widespread along the eastern continental margin of Laurentia, stretching from the southern Appalachians to northern Greenland (Rankin et al1989, 1993; Harris & Johnson 1991; Johnson 1991; Stewart 1991; Thomas 1991; Williams et al
However, recent evidence for a Neoproterozoic tectonothermal event in the Moine has been related to Knoydartian orogenesis (Vance et al1998) and is inconsistent with a protracted rifting model
The lowest, predominantly gneissic part of the Grampian Group (Central Highland Division) has yielded Neoproterozoic Rb–Sr mica ages that led Piasecki (1980) and Piasecki & van Breeman (1983) to propose that it represents a correlative of the Moine Supergroup lying south of the Great Glen Fault, and preserves an unconformable cover– basement relationship with the overlying Grampian Group modified by later shearingHighton et al
(1999) obtained a U/Pb zircon age of 840  11 Ma from inferred syn-D1 anatectic granites in the gneisses supporting this correlation, indicating deformation and metamorphism during a Neoproterozoic Knoydartian event (see Friend et al1997; Rogers et al
In Ireland the Dalradian is structurally underlain by Precambrian gneisses of the Annagh Gneiss Complex and the Slishwood Division (Daly 2001).Recent work by the British Geological Survey, summarized by Smith et al
To date, no rocks that can be definitely ascribed to the Grampian and younger groups of the Dalradian succession have yielded evidence for Neoproterozoic deformation, suggesting that the base of the Grampian Group (sensu Smith et al1999) is younger than c

Analysis of 50 detrital zircon grains yielded a broad age range extending from Archaean grains as old as 3000 Ma to endMesoproterozoic grains at around 1000 Ma, but with significant gaps in the age spectrum in the early Palaeoproterozoic between 2500 and 2150 Ma and in the late Palaeoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic between 1700 and 1100 Ma (Figs 4 and 5e)The oldest grains consist of two concordant analyses with ages of 2986  12 Ma and 2952  13 Ma
Mesoproterozoic zircons are absent apart from a single analysis at about 1100 Ma.The 48 analysed zircon grains range in age from 2900 to 950 Ma (Figs 4 and 5h)
Subsidiary peaks occur at 2640 Ma and 2475 Ma, but it is difficult to extract any discrete age groups from the concordia diagram and these may represent different degrees of Pb loss in the ProterozoicLate Palaeoproterozoic ages cluster about a single peak at 1830 Ma (Fig
4), and Mesoproterozoic to earliest Neoproterozoic grains constitute a broad-based age cluster ranging from 1450 to 950 Ma with a main peak at 1100 Ma and subsidiary peaks at 1400 Ma and 970 Ma.Analyses of 65 zircon grains range from 2800 Ma to around 1000 Ma (Fig

At least some of these zones of alteration give earliest Neoproterozoic ages (Fig8c and d) and/or are associated with discordia lines that give early Neoproterozoic lower intercept ages.

Neoproterozoic, the Dalradian succession accumulated within the Rodinian supercontinent and was surrounded by Laurentia, Baltica and Amazonia (Fig9)
The late Archaean and late Palaeo- to earliest Neoproterozoic detrital zircon age groups within the Dalradian samples are in broad agreement with the age of the principal lithotectonic units recognized in Laurentia, Amazonia and Baltica.Facies analysis indicates that although Dalradian basin evolution involved multiple periods of synsedimentary faulting alter-
This is also supported by the absence in the Appin and younger Dalradian units of any evidence for a 2.49 Ga metamorphic overprint, which is a feature of the Lewisian gneisses in the central mainland units in the Northwest Highlands (Kinny & Friend 1997) and by the fact that the Lewisian would have been blanketed by the earliest Neoproterozoic Torridon Group (Stewart 1991).The relatively subdued frequency of mid-Mesoproterozoic zircon detritus in the Dalradian sequence argues against input from an Amazonian source
The relatively subdued frequency of mid-Mesoproterozoic zircon detritus in the Dalradian sequence argues against input from an Amazonian sourceThe exposed portions of the Rondonia–San Ignacio and Sunsas belts of the Amazonia craton contain extensive units with ages in the range 1.4–1.2 Ga and hence zircons of this age should form a significant component of any Amazonian sourced detritus (Tassinari et al
Mesoproterozoic to earliest Neoproterozoic detrital zircons correspond in age to assembly of the Grenville Orogen (Gower 1996; Rivers 1997)The bulk of the detrital zircons within this age range are younger than 1200 Ma, with most at c
1000 Ma, which, together with the presence of late Palaeoproterozoic detritus and the paucity of older Mesoproterozoic detritus, is consistent with the history of the NE Grenville sequence in Labrador, as opposed to the southern Grenville Province (see Gower 1996; Rivers 1997)The widespread tectonothermal event within the source at 1.0–0.9 Ga is slightly younger than the 1.0 Ga timing of final collisional suturing of the Grenville Orogen in Labrador but corresponds to the timing of terminal tectonothermal events in East Greenland (Strachan et al
The endPalaeoproterozoic grains probably reflect orogenic events associated with Laurentian assembly whereas the Neoproterozoic detritus may relate to Rodinian breakup including Knoydartian eventsThe detrital mica age patterns contrast with those for the zircon detritus from the Southern Highland Group, which contains Archaean material but is poor in late Palaeoproterozoic detritus and generally lacks Neoproterozoic zircons.

Summary of detrital zircon age signatures, the depositional age ranges and timing of tectonothermal events for the late Mesoproterozoic to Cambrian Laurentian margin siliciclastic sequences in Newfoundland,Scotland and Greenland
Grey shading for Neoproterozoic tectonothermal event in Grampian Group column indicates uncertainty as to whether the group was affected by event at this time (see Smith et al1999)
Group 1, consisting of the Mesoproterozoic Stoer Group, is dominated by Archaean detritus with no Mesoproterozoic detritusGroup 2 includes the latest Mesoproterozoic to mid-Neoproterozoic Moine, Krummedal and lower Eleonore Bay supergroups and the Torridon and Grampian groups, and is characterized by late Palaeoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic zircon detritus with Archaean zircons generally either absent or rare, except for the Torridon Group where they form a significant component
Group 2 includes the latest Mesoproterozoic to mid-Neoproterozoic Moine, Krummedal and lower Eleonore Bay supergroups and the Torridon and Grampian groups, and is characterized by late Palaeoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic zircon detritus with Archaean zircons generally either absent or rare, except for the Torridon Group where they form a significant componentGroup 3 consists of Neoproterozoic to Cambrian siliciclastic sequences in Newfoundland, the Appin, Argyll and Southern Highland groups of the main Dalradian sequence in Scotland, and the upper Eleonore Bay Supergroup, Tillite Group and Zebra Series of East Greenland, and contains late Archaean and late Palaeoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic detritus.
Group 3 consists of Neoproterozoic to Cambrian siliciclastic sequences in Newfoundland, the Appin, Argyll and Southern Highland groups of the main Dalradian sequence in Scotland, and the upper Eleonore Bay Supergroup, Tillite Group and Zebra Series of East Greenland, and contains late Archaean and late Palaeoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic detritus.Group 1
The age of the unit is poorly constrained but it is generally considered to be of late Mesoproterozoic age (c1200 Ma) based on isotopic and palaeomagnetic constraints (Moorbath 1969; Smith et al
The lack of Mesoproterozoic zircon detritus within the Stoer Group is consistent with the inferred Mesoproterozoic depositional age with sediment accumulation predating establishment of the Grenville orogenic welt as a source region.Group 2
The detrital zircon age signature of all units is characterized by a dominance of late Palaeoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic detritusArchaean detrital grains are either absent or constitute only a few percent of the total age spectrum
Time of accumulation of the Moine, Central Highland and Krummedal sediments is constrained to between the latest Mesoproterozoic and early Neoproterozoic on the basis of the youngest detrital zircons and subsequent overprint by tectonothermal eventsIn detail, however, available data suggest that the Moine may be younger than the Krummedal succession
The age of the Eleonore Bay Supergroup is less well constrained and could range throughout the NeoproterozoicDetrital zircons as young as late Mesoproterozoic from the basal Nathorst Land Group provide an older age limit on sediment accumulation and the uppermost units of the supergroup contain late Neoproterozoic acritarchs (Vidal 1976)
Detrital zircons as young as late Mesoproterozoic from the basal Nathorst Land Group provide an older age limit on sediment accumulation and the uppermost units of the supergroup contain late Neoproterozoic acritarchs (Vidal 1976)Watt et al
(2000) suggested that the Nathorst Land Group may represent part of the Krummedal succession rather than part of the Eleonore Bay Supergroup because of their similar detrital zircon signature, with deposition occurring in the earliest Neoproterozoic before intrusion of 960– 950 Ma Grenville granitesSuch an interpretation would require a tectonic break or unconformity between the Nathorst Land Group and the remainder of the Eleonore Bay Supergroup
Resting unconformably on the Stoer Group or Lewisian gneiss, it is unconformably overlain by Cambrian strata of the Eriboll Group (Stewart 1991; Walton & Oliver 1991)An older limit on the time of deposition is provided by the youngest detrital zircon age of 1060  18 Ma (Rainbird et al
800 Ma for pegmatites and mylonites that affect ?Grampian and sub-Grampian Group rocks, confirming the earlier work of Piaseski (1980) and Piasecki & van Breeman (1983) that these rocks record a Precambrian (Knoydartian) tectonothermal event and probably correlate with the Moine SupergroupDetrital zircon data and the monazite ages thus constrain deposition to 900–850 Ma
The Appin, Argyll and Southern Highland groups of the Dalradian, and the Labrador Group, Curling Group and Fleur de Lys Supergroup in the Appalachians have a detrital zircon age signature characterized by late Archaean and late Palaeoproterozoic to Mesoproterozoic detritus and have a depositional age that ranges from mid-Neoproterozoic to CambrianThe upper components of the Eleonore Bay Supergroup, above the Nathorst Land Group, and the Tillite Group of the East Greenland Caledonides are included in this group on the basis of lithotectonic character (Soper & Higgins 1993) but no detrital zircon data are available for these units
Some samples of latest Neoproterozoic age, which accumulated during the final stages of rifting before breakup, also contain scattered late Neoproterozoic detrital zircons probably derived from synrift igneous activityThe Newfoundland samples differ from the Scottish samples in the larger gap in detrital zircon ages between Palaeoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic detritus
The Newfoundland samples differ from the Scottish samples in the larger gap in detrital zircon ages between Palaeoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic detritusCawood & Nemchin (2001) argued that this reflects a southern Grenville provenance for the Newfoundland samples, as opposed to the inferred northern Grenville–Greenland location of the source of the Scottish material.
Principal characteristics of the detrital zircon population in the Dalradian are Archaean grains (Grampian Group excepted), notably around 2.8–2.7 Ga, a paucity of early Palaeoproterozoic detritus (2.5–2.0 Ga), the presence of detrital age peaks at around 1.8 Ga, 1.75–1.7 Ga, 1.65–1.60 Ga and 1.55–1.5 Ga, a paucity of mid-Mesoproterozoic detritus (1.4–1.2 Ga), and detrital grains around 1.1 Ga and 1.0–0.9 GaThe age signature of detrital zircons within the Dalradian as well as the Torridonian and Moine is consistent with derivation from a Laurentian hinterland
A Laurentian provenance is also consistent with the Laurentian affinities of the Cambrian fauna found within the Leny Limestone and within the Eriboll Group, which unconformably overlies the Torridon GroupThese features argue against an exotic origin, with respect to Laurentia, for either the depositional setting of the units or the detritus that accumulated within these basins
The absence of any midNeoproterozoic detritus related to the Knoydartian event within the Dalradian sequence argues against any significant topographic expression resulting in reworking of affected units.The preservation of the Dalradian succession within the Caledonian Orogen and the probability of sinistral strike-slip displacement within the orogen (e.g
The overall age character of the detritus, and in particular the paucity of midMesoproterozoic detritus (1.4–1.2 Ga) and the input of detritus of 1.0–0.9 Ga age, is consistent with derivation from the Greenland–Labrador segment of the marginGiven the established large transport distances between source and depositional basin for other ancient sedimentary successions (Riggs et al
