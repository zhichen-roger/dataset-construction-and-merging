These units contain stratigraphic sequences made of Mesozoic evaporitic and carbonate deposits covered by Oligocene to Miocene turbidite deposits, which are progressively younger toward the northeastThe main turbitidic successions are known as the upper Oligocene to lower Miocene Macigno (Tuscan Unit), the lower Miocene Modino sandstone (Modino Unit), the lowermiddle Miocene Cervarola sandstone (Cervarola Unit), and the middle-upper Miocene Marnoso-Arenacea Formation (UmbriaMarche Domain).
