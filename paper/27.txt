New U– Pb zircon geochronologic data from orthogneisses of the Amdo basement better resolve Neoproterozoic and Cambro-Ordovician magmatism in central TibetThe Amdo basement is exposed within the Bangong suture zone between the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes and is composed of granitic orthogneisses with subordinate paragneisses and metasedimentary rocks
The intermediate-felsic orthogneisses show a bimodal distribution of Neoproterozoic (920–820 Ma) and Cambro-Ordovician (540–460 Ma) crystallization agesThese and other sparse basement ages from Tibetan terranes suggest the plateau is underlain by juvenile crust that is Neoproterozoic or younger; its young age and weaker rheology relative to cratonic blocks bounding the plateau margins likely facilitated the propagation of Indo-Asian deformation far into Asia
These and other sparse basement ages from Tibetan terranes suggest the plateau is underlain by juvenile crust that is Neoproterozoic or younger; its young age and weaker rheology relative to cratonic blocks bounding the plateau margins likely facilitated the propagation of Indo-Asian deformation far into AsiaThe Neoproterozoic ages post-date Rodinia assembly and magmatism of similar ages is documented in the Qaidaim–Kunlun terrane, South China block, the Aravalli–Delhi craton in NW India, the Eastern Ghats of India, and the Prince Charles mountains in Antarctica
The Neoproterozoic ages post-date Rodinia assembly and magmatism of similar ages is documented in the Qaidaim–Kunlun terrane, South China block, the Aravalli–Delhi craton in NW India, the Eastern Ghats of India, and the Prince Charles mountains in AntarcticaThe Amdo Neoproterozoic plutons cannot be unambiguously related to one of these regions, but we propose that the Yangtze block of the South China block is the most likely association, with the Amdo basement representing a terrane that possibly rifted from the active Yangtze margin in the middle Neoproterozoic
The Amdo Neoproterozoic plutons cannot be unambiguously related to one of these regions, but we propose that the Yangtze block of the South China block is the most likely association, with the Amdo basement representing a terrane that possibly rifted from the active Yangtze margin in the middle NeoproterozoicCambro-Ordovician granitoids are ubiquitous throughout Gondwana as a product of active margin tectonics following Gondwana assembly and indicate that the Lhasa–Qiangtang terranes were involved in these tectono-magmatic events

U–Pb detrital zircon analysis of two quartzites from the Amdo basement suggest that the protoliths were Carboniferous–Permian continental margin strata widely deposited across the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranesThe detrital zircon age spectra of the upper Paleozoic Tibetan sandstones and other rocks deposited in East Gondwana during the late Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic are all quite similar, making it difficult to use the age spectra for paleogeographic determinations
The detrital zircon age spectra of the upper Paleozoic Tibetan sandstones and other rocks deposited in East Gondwana during the late Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic are all quite similar, making it difficult to use the age spectra for paleogeographic determinationsThere is a suggestion in the data that the Qiangtang terrane may have been located further west along Gondwana’s northern boundary than the Lhasa terrane, but more refined spatial and temporal data are needed to verify this configuration.
Like most of central and southeast Asia, Tibet formed from an amalgamation of terranes during the Phanerozoic (Chang and Zheng, 1973; Allégre et al., 1984; Chang et al., 1986; Sengör andNatal’in, 1996; Yin and Nie, 1996; Fig
The pre-Mesozoic geological history of the terranes that make up Tibet is obscured by the paucity of basement exposures and the predominance of supracrustal assemblages that are late Paleozoic and younger (e.gLiu, 1988; Pan et al., 2004).
U–Pb dating of zircons in gneissic rocks revealed Neoproterozoic crystalline crust in the Amdo basement (850 Ma; Guynn et al., 2006; Fig2) and in the central Lhasa terrane just west of Nam Lake (750 Ma; Hu et al., 2004; Fig
The orthogneiss of the Amdo basement also contains Cambrian protoliths (530 Ma; Xu et al., 1985)Gneissic basement exposures in the Qiangtang terrane yielded Ordovician (476–474 Ma) U–Pb zircon crystallization ages (Pullen et al., 2011), while an

These few ages represent the only known pre-Mesozoic crystalline basement from TibetAlternatively, isotopic work has been used to suggest that the crust of the Lhasa and possibly Qiangtang terranes is older, perhaps even Archean
Alternatively, isotopic work has been used to suggest that the crust of the Lhasa and possibly Qiangtang terranes is older, perhaps even ArcheanNd isotope data from the Cambrian orthogneiss of Amdo yielded Mesoproterozoic model ages (Harris et al., 1988b), while Sr, Nd and zircon Hf isotopic studies on Cretaceous granitoids of the Lhasa terrane yield Proterozoic and Archean model ages (Chiu et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009a)
Nd isotope data from the Cambrian orthogneiss of Amdo yielded Mesoproterozoic model ages (Harris et al., 1988b), while Sr, Nd and zircon Hf isotopic studies on Cretaceous granitoids of the Lhasa terrane yield Proterozoic and Archean model ages (Chiu et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009a)It is possible, though, that the enriched radiogenic isotopic compositions could result from the assimilation of melted sedimentary rocks that were themselves sourced from older continents far from Tibet, rather than from pre-Neoproterozoic crystalline crust (Ding et al., 2003)
It is possible, though, that the enriched radiogenic isotopic compositions could result from the assimilation of melted sedimentary rocks that were themselves sourced from older continents far from Tibet, rather than from pre-Neoproterozoic crystalline crust (Ding et al., 2003)If the latter is the case, and the juvenile ages of the basement exposures are representative of the entire Tibetan crust, then the spatial extent of the modern Tibetan plateau may have been pre-determined by the distribution of more juvenile (e.g
Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic), and presumably rheologically weaker crust compared to the more ancient (e.gArchean and Paleoproterozoic) Tarim North China and South China blocks bounding the plateau (Molnar and Tapponnier, 1981; Fig
Archean and Paleoproterozoic) Tarim North China and South China blocks bounding the plateau (Molnar and Tapponnier, 1981; Fig1).
The Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes are widely interpreted to have been located along East Gondwana’s margin during the Paleozoic on the basis of widespread Carboniferous–Permian diamictites and Gondwana flora and fauna (Leeder et al., 1988; Metcalfe, 1996)Traditionally, they have been considered to have formed a composite terrane located on the northern margin of India (e.g
Metcalfe, 1996, 2006; Scotese, 2001), with the Qiangtang terrane rifting during the Late Permian (Leeder et al., 1988; Pearce and Mei, 1988; Yin, 1997; Yin and Harrison, 2000) followed by the Lhasa terrane during the Late Triassic (Pearce and Mei, 1988; Gaetani and Garzanti, 1991; Yin and Harrison, 2000)Recently, though, a paleogeophraphic connection between the Lhasa terrane and northwestern Australia during the Permian has been proposed (Ferrari et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009b, 2010) and Zhu et al
Recently, though, a paleogeophraphic connection between the Lhasa terrane and northwestern Australia during the Permian has been proposed (Ferrari et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009b, 2010) and Zhu et al(2010) present geological evidence that Lhasa was an isolated terrane located in the Paleo-Tethys during the Early Permian.

The data confirm a significant episode of early Neoproterozoic magmatism, first reported by Guynn et al(2006), and show that the widespread Cambro-Ordovician tectonism along the margins of Gondwana also affected the Amdo basement

Detrital zircon U–Pb age spectra of quartzites from the basement are similar to age spectra from Carboniferous–Permian strata of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes, suggesting the latter are the protoliths of the formerThe age spectra of upper Paleozoic strata from central and southern Tibet are similar to those from other strata deposited in northern East Gondwana during the late Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic
The age spectra of upper Paleozoic strata from central and southern Tibet are similar to those from other strata deposited in northern East Gondwana during the late Neoproterozoic and PaleozoicThe similarities between these detrital zircon age signatures makes it difficult to discriminate between proposed paleogeographic positions of the Tibetan terranes, though a slight difference suggests the Qiangtang terrane and Amdo basement may have been located further west than the Lhasa terrane.
Regional geology during the Neoproterozoic and PhanerozoicIn this paper, the ancient Tethys oceanic realm in Asia is subdivided into three regions after Sengör (1984) and Metcalfe (1996): the Paleo-Tethys, which separated the Cimmerian terranes (including the Qiangtang and Sibumasu terranes; Fig
During the late Mesoproterozoic, multiple orogenic belts developed that possibly marked the amalgamation of most of the continents into a supercontinent termed ‘‘Rodinia’’ (e.gMeert and Torsvik, 2003; Li et al., 2008)
The Neoproterozoic saw the break-up of Rodinia and the reassembly of many of the continents into Gondwana by the CambrianThe tectonic and paleogeographic histories of even major continents during Rodinia assembly and consequent break-up are not well constrained, particularly India (e.g
While Gondwana assembly appears to have been complete by the end of the Neoproterozoic, magmatism and tectonism continued until 450 Ma, probably as a result of newly established subduction zones along the margins (Ramezani and Tucker, 2003; Boger and Miller, 2004; Cawood et al., 2007; Horton et al., 2008)During the late Permian, Gondwana began rifting apart, first as terranes along the edges and then as entire continents
During the late Permian, Gondwana began rifting apart, first as terranes along the edges and then as entire continentsThe terranes which rifted from East Gondwana accreted to the southern margin of Asia during the Mesozoic (Sengör and Natal’in, 1996; Yin and Harrison, 2000) and culminated in the closure of the Neo-Tethys Ocean by the collision of India with Asia in the Eocene (e.g
The terranes which rifted from East Gondwana accreted to the southern margin of Asia during the Mesozoic (Sengör and Natal’in, 1996; Yin and Harrison, 2000) and culminated in the closure of the Neo-Tethys Ocean by the collision of India with Asia in the Eocene (e.gAllégre et al., 1984).
It is defined by a broad and discontinuous belt of ophiolite fragments and mélange and is a result of Meso-Tethys Ocean closure and subsequent collision between the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes during the Early Cretaceous (Girardeau et al., 1984; Dewey et al., 1988; Kapp et al., 2003a, 2007a; Guynn et al., 2006)The Indus-Yarlung suture, the southern boundary of the Lhasa terrane (Fig
2), was the site of the collision of India with Asia during the Eocene and rocks to the south of the suture have an Indian affinity (Burg and Chen, 1984; Dewey et al., 1988)The term ‘‘Greater India’’ refers to the northern Indian crust that was subducted beneath Asia during the collision (e.g
The two terranes have similar Carboniferous–Permian diamictite-bearing stratigraphy (Leeder et al., 1988) and shared Gondwanan flora and fauna (Metcalfe, 1996)The Qiangtang terrane is thought to have been part of the long and continuous Cimmerian continent that rifted from northern Gondwana during the Permian and drifted rapidly northward, closing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean and opening the Meso-Tethys Ocean (Sengör, 1979, 1984; Metcalfe, 1996, 2006)
The Qiangtang terrane is thought to have been part of the long and continuous Cimmerian continent that rifted from northern Gondwana during the Permian and drifted rapidly northward, closing the Paleo-Tethys Ocean and opening the Meso-Tethys Ocean (Sengör, 1979, 1984; Metcalfe, 1996, 2006)The Cimmerian continent was composed, from west to east, of Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Qiangtang and Sibumasu (Simao–Burma–Malaya– Sumatra) and its existence is based on similarities in paleolatitudes, flora, fauna and ages of accretionary deformation between the different terranes (Metcalfe (2006) and references therein)
Upper Carboniferous and Lower Permian extrusive rocks and volcanoclastic sedimentary rocks in the northern Lhasa terrane have been attributed to rifting of a terrane (Leeder et al., 1988; Pearce and Mei, 1988), possibly the Qiangtang (Yin, 1997; Yin and Harrison, 2000)Separation of the Lhasa terrane from northern India (Gaetani and Garzanti, 1991) is based on Late Triassic rifting in the southern Lhasa terrane (Pearce and Mei, 1988) that was coeval with rifting recorded in the Himalaya (Gaetani and Garzanti, 1991)
Separation of the Lhasa terrane from northern India (Gaetani and Garzanti, 1991) is based on Late Triassic rifting in the southern Lhasa terrane (Pearce and Mei, 1988) that was coeval with rifting recorded in the Himalaya (Gaetani and Garzanti, 1991)A summary of the limited paleomagnetic data by Li et al
(2004) suggests that the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes were at approximately the same latitude until the Qiangtang terrane started drifting northward during the late Permian and their subsequent paleolatitudes are consistent with the timing of rifting and collisional events mentioned above.The conventional interpretation of placing the Lhasa terrane north of India and south of the Qiangtang terrane in Gondwana reconstructions has recently been questioned
(2008) proposed that the Lhasa terrane was located next to northwest Australia during the Late Carboniferous based on their suggestion of southward subduction of the eastern Paleo-Tethys and a reinterpretation of northern Lhasa terrane Permian volcanic rocks as arc-related rather than rift-relatedThis alternative Australian connection was further advanced by Zhu et al
(2009b, 2010), although they suggest that during the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian the northern Lhasa terrane was located north of Gondwana within the Paleo-Tethys oceanIn this model, the southern Paleo-Tethys ocean subducted northward beneath the Lhasa terrane’s southern margin leading to collision of the Lhasa terrane with northwest Australia during the Late Permian
In this model, the southern Paleo-Tethys ocean subducted northward beneath the Lhasa terrane’s southern margin leading to collision of the Lhasa terrane with northwest Australia during the Late PermianThe Qiangtang terrane is located adjacent to India in this case and rifted from India during the Middle-Late Permian
The Qiangtang terrane is located adjacent to India in this case and rifted from India during the Middle-Late PermianThis reconstruction is based on: (1) the geochemistry of the Permian basalts which suggests those in the Himalaya and the southern Qiangtang terrane formed in an extensional setting while the southern Lhasa terrane basalts were generated in an arc setting (Zhu et al., 2010); (2) the presence of Middle Permian granites with arc-related geochemical signatures in the central Lhasa terrane (Zhu et al., 2009b); and (3) the presence of a Permian (262 ± 5 Ma) eclogite in the central Lhasa terrane which is interpreted to mark a Middle–Late Permian suture zone (Yang et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2010)
This reconstruction is based on: (1) the geochemistry of the Permian basalts which suggests those in the Himalaya and the southern Qiangtang terrane formed in an extensional setting while the southern Lhasa terrane basalts were generated in an arc setting (Zhu et al., 2010); (2) the presence of Middle Permian granites with arc-related geochemical signatures in the central Lhasa terrane (Zhu et al., 2009b); and (3) the presence of a Permian (262 ± 5 Ma) eclogite in the central Lhasa terrane which is interpreted to mark a Middle–Late Permian suture zone (Yang et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2010)While this arrangement explains the relationships of Permian igneous rocks, it is at odds with floral and faunal data which suggest the West Burma and Sibumasu terranes were located along northwest Australia (Metcalfe (2006) and references therein) and with paleomagnetic data which indicates the Qiangtang terrane was north of the Lhasa terrane (Li et al., 2004)
While this arrangement explains the relationships of Permian igneous rocks, it is at odds with floral and faunal data which suggest the West Burma and Sibumasu terranes were located along northwest Australia (Metcalfe (2006) and references therein) and with paleomagnetic data which indicates the Qiangtang terrane was north of the Lhasa terrane (Li et al., 2004)Furthermore, the Lhasa terrane contains the Carboniferous diamictites common to Gondwana (Leeder et al., 1988) which indicates it was not isolated within the Paleo-Tethys during that time.
Furthermore, the Lhasa terrane contains the Carboniferous diamictites common to Gondwana (Leeder et al., 1988) which indicates it was not isolated within the Paleo-Tethys during that time.Exposures within the Tibetan terranes generally consist of lowgrade supracrustal rocks of late Paleozoic–Cenozoic age (Leeder et al., 1988; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Pan et al., 2004)
Exposures within the Tibetan terranes generally consist of lowgrade supracrustal rocks of late Paleozoic–Cenozoic age (Leeder et al., 1988; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Pan et al., 2004)The only dated basement rocks in the Qiangtang terrane are orthogneisses from the Duguer Shan (476–474 Ma; Pullen et al., 2011) and a block of mafic gneiss in melange near Gangma Co that yielded Cambrian and Ordovician zircon ages (Kapp et al., 2000; Fig
The only dated basement rocks in the Qiangtang terrane are orthogneisses from the Duguer Shan (476–474 Ma; Pullen et al., 2011) and a block of mafic gneiss in melange near Gangma Co that yielded Cambrian and Ordovician zircon ages (Kapp et al., 2000; Fig2) (Fig
The only other known Precambrian basement exposure in central Tibet is the Amdo basement which occurs southeast of the town of Amdo (Xu et al., 1985; Dewey et al., 1988; Harris et al., 1988c; Guynn et al., 2006; Fig2)
It is possible there are additional Precambrian or Cambro-Ordovician rocks in the suture zone to the east (Pan et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2008; Fig2) but no dates have yet been published.
The Amdo basement is composed of upper amphibolite facies orthogneisses with a few, isolated exposures of metasedimentary rocks, mafic amphibolites and migmatites that have been intruded by Jurassic granitoids (Xu et al., 1985; Coward et al., 1988; Harris et al., 1988a; Guynn et al., 2006; Fig3 )
Many of the zircons in this orthogneiss were also discordant due to Jurassic metamorphism that resulted in young zircon growth on the rims (Guynn et al., 2006).The Amdo basement is located within the Bangong suture zone and there are ophiolite exposures north and south of it (Coward et al., 1988)
(2006) suggested the basement may have been associated with the Qiangtang terrane because if subduction of the Meso-Tethys ocean was northward beneath Qiangtang (Dewey et al., 1988), then Middle Jurassic metamorphism of the Amdo basement would be associated with this marginIf the two terranes were contiguous until Triassic rifting (Dewey et al., 1988; Leeder et al., 1988), then the differentiation between them is not critical for Paleozoic paleogeography
If the two terranes were contiguous until Triassic rifting (Dewey et al., 1988; Leeder et al., 1988), then the differentiation between them is not critical for Paleozoic paleogeographyHowever, it has been suggested that the Lhasa terrane was not adjacent to the Qiangtang terrane until their amalgamation during the Early Cretaceous (Ferrari et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2010).
However, it has been suggested that the Lhasa terrane was not adjacent to the Qiangtang terrane until their amalgamation during the Early Cretaceous (Ferrari et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2010).We conducted U–Pb zircon geochronology on eight samples of Amdo orthogneiss to determine their crystallization ages
In the case of the older Neoproterozoic magmatism, we typically use 206Pb⁄/207Pb⁄ ages to compensate for lead loss or metamorphic zircon growthFor many of the orthogneiss rocks though, there is not a clear cluster of concordant ages
Zircons in Amdo basement rocks underwent lead loss and metamorphic zircon growth during Early Jurassic high-grade metamorphism (180 Ma; Guynn et al., 2006)Crystallization of zircon from metamorphic fluids can generally be distinguished from magmatic zircon growth or lead loss by a high U/Th ratio (e.g
The older age group is early Neoproterozoic (920– 820 Ma) and the younger is Cambo-Ordovician (540–460 Ma)Most of the orthogneisses do not have inherited zircons.
Since there are no Jurassic metamorphic ages in this sample, we anchor the lower intercept of the discordia at 180 ± 10, the age of high-grade metamorphism reported by Guynn et al(2006)
As there is only one zircon with a Jurassic age in this sample, we use the age of metamorphism reported by Guynn et al(2006) to anchor the discordia line at
The majority of zircon analyses in this sample are discordant although there are some concordant analyses of Precambrian and Jurassic age (Fig4c)
There is a distinct cluster of 14 Jurassic ages with a mean 206Pb⁄/238U age of 181 ± 4 Ma, the majority of which are from zircon cores (Fig4d)
We interpret the older ages to record Cambro-Ordovician crystallization pulled down by lead loss and the Jurassic age to be metamorphic growth based on the high U/Th ratios (15–60) of the Jurassic zircon analyses (Table 2), the lack of an unambiguous Jurassic age for any other gneiss and the undeformed nature of all documented granitoids of Jurassic age that intrude the Amdo basement (Guynn et al., 2006)A discordia regression yields a poorly defined upper intercept of 468 ± 53 Ma
A conservative interpretation is that the sample has a Cambro-Ordovician protolith, consistent with the other early Paleozoic crystallization ages.This sample is a weakly foliated, felsic orthogneiss that contains abundant accessory magnetite, with some crystals up to several mm across
Two concordant Proterozoic zircons (in Table 2 but not shown in Fig4e) are interpreted to be inherited
Three zircons from this sample yield Mesozoic ages, but the majority cluster around 500 Ma (Fig4g)
The Mesozoic ages are likely a mix of metamorphic zircon with some older zircon; they have U/Th ratios over 6 compared to 1 for the older agesAn average of 18 clustered 206Pb⁄/238U ages yields an interpreted crystallization age of 483 ± 13 Ma (Fig
crystallization age and the older zircons to be inherited, although the large number of the latter suggests a significant component of crustal melting of the Precambrian gneiss for the generation of this sampleA weighted average 206Pb⁄/238U age of 487 ± 16 Ma was calculated using six concordant, low uncertainty analyses around 500 Ma (Fig
A weighted average of 18 low uncertainty, concordant 206Pb⁄/207Pb⁄ ages defines an older, inherited protolith age of 880 ± 21 Ma, consistent with the other Neoproterozoic orthogneiss agesConsidering the uncertainty and discordance, we only confidently report a Cambro-Ordovician crystallization age with significant early Neoproterozoic inheritance.
Considering the uncertainty and discordance, we only confidently report a Cambro-Ordovician crystallization age with significant early Neoproterozoic inheritance.U–Pb detrital zircon analysis was performed on three samples of metasedimentary rocks from the Amdo basement
Many of the tips were large enough to analyze with a 25 or 35 lm laser spot size and most of these analyses yielded midJurassic ages and high U/Th ratios, while the cores had much older ages with low U/Th ratios (Fig7), revealing that the majority of the euhedral zircon shapes are due to metamorphic growth during Jurassic metamorphism (Guynn et al., 2006)
7), revealing that the majority of the euhedral zircon shapes are due to metamorphic growth during Jurassic metamorphism (Guynn et al., 2006)The high-grade metamorphism also appears to have resulted in lead loss for some of the grains so we prefer to rely on the 206Pb⁄/207Pb⁄ ages rather than 206 ⁄ 238 Pb / U ages for construction of the probability density function, despite the larger uncertainty for the former
There were a total of 161 analyses, of which 16 were tips with Jurassic ages and 6 were poor analyses, leaving 139 ages that were used in the age spectrum (Table 2)The resulting age spectrum has broad, overlapping peaks at 850 and 950 Ma, small peaks at 1150 and 1430 Ma and large peaks at 1600, 1700 and 2500 Ma
Given the lead loss and metamorphic overgrowth, a maximum depositional age is difficult to assign; we can only estimate it as mid-Neoproterozoic (800–700 Ma) based on the youngest non-Jurassic 206Pb⁄/207Pb⁄ agesWhile the middle Neoproterozoic is a maximum depositional age for the paragneiss protolith, the lack of 550–450 Ma zircons, ages which are ubiquitous across Gondwana and in Gondwanan Paleozoic sandstones (Fig
While the middle Neoproterozoic is a maximum depositional age for the paragneiss protolith, the lack of 550–450 Ma zircons, ages which are ubiquitous across Gondwana and in Gondwanan Paleozoic sandstones (Fig8), make it unlikely that the paragneiss is younger than Neoproterozoic
8), make it unlikely that the paragneiss is younger than NeoproterozoicTherefore we tentatively assign the paragneiss protolith a mid-late Neoproterozoic depositional age.
Therefore we tentatively assign the paragneiss protolith a mid-late Neoproterozoic depositional age.Quartzite sample JG062505-3 comes from a small exposure within the gneisses near the northern edge of the Amdo basement exposure (Fig
This sample yielded a spectrum with many different peaks in the Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic, including strong peaks at 500 Ma, 550 Ma, 590 Ma, 825 Ma and 910 MaThere are a few small peaks between 1050 Ma and 1400 Ma, a group of ages at 2500 Ma and a few ages between 2600 Ma and 2800 Ma
The cores are older detrital zircon grains and the tips represent Jurassic metamorphic growth, as revealed by U–Pb dating, shown for two of the zirconsThe number in italics beneath the age is the U/Th ratio, which is larger for metamorphic zircon.

There are only a few Archean ages older than 2600 MaThe two youngest concordant ages combined give a maximum depositional age of 447 ± 30 Ma; the youngest group of four ages gives a maximum age of 510 Ma.
The Precambrian protoliths of the Amdo orthogneisses were emplaced at 920–820 Ma (Table 1), providing a minimum age for central Tibetan crustThese are the oldest known rocks in central Tibet, and together with the mid-Neoproterozoic ages reported for igneous rocks in the Lhasa terrane (Hu et al., 2004) and early Neoproterozoic granitoids in the Qaidam–Kunlun terrane (Gehrels et al., 2003b), they imply that Tibet is underlain by relatively juvenile crust
These are the oldest known rocks in central Tibet, and together with the mid-Neoproterozoic ages reported for igneous rocks in the Lhasa terrane (Hu et al., 2004) and early Neoproterozoic granitoids in the Qaidam–Kunlun terrane (Gehrels et al., 2003b), they imply that Tibet is underlain by relatively juvenile crustThe young and therefore rheologically weak crust could explain why deformation related to the Indo-Asian collision has propagated so far into Asia (Molnar and Tapponnier, 1981)
While other workers have suggested the crust of Tibet is as old as Early– Middle Proterozoic and even Archean based on isotopic data for the Amdo Cambrian orthogneiss (Harris et al., 1988b) and Phanerozoic granites and detrital zircons from the Lhasa terrane (Chiu et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2009a), it us uncertain how isotopic compositions have been affected by melting of sedimentary rocks sourced from old cratonic blocks (e.gIndia and Australia; Ding et al., 2003)
To date, no rocks older than Neoproterozoic have been definitively dated from the Tibetan terranes.The early Neoproterozoic age of the Amdo gneiss provides some constraint for the origin of these rocks prior to their assembly with Gondwana
The early Neoproterozoic age of the Amdo gneiss provides some constraint for the origin of these rocks prior to their assembly with GondwanaThis age postdates most of the orogenies responsible for the assembly of Rodinia but is relatively prevalent throughout Asian terranes and also occurs in India and Antarctica.
Early Neoproterozoic magmatism is common throughout the Yangtze craton of the South China block, particularly 825 Ma ages, both as igneous rocks (Li, 1999; Li et al., 2003; Ling et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2006; Xiao et al., 2007) and as detrital zircon age peaks from Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks (Sun et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010a)Early Neoproterozoic magmatism of the Jiangnan orogeny is probably related to the collision of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks which created the South China block (Fig
Early Neoproterozoic magmatism of the Jiangnan orogeny is probably related to the collision of the Yangtze and Cathaysia blocks which created the South China block (Fig9), with the Cathaysia block attached to Australia at the time (Chen et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2007, 2008)
Proponents of the former model generally argue for the position of the South China block along the northwestern margin of Australia until rifting in the Late Devonian (Yu et al., 2008; Roger et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010b; Duan et al., 2011), largely based on detrital zircon provenance dataProponents of the plume model place the South China block between eastern Australia and Laurentia until rifting and Rodinia break-up in the middle Neoproterozoic (Li et al., 2008, 2011)
Proponents of the plume model place the South China block between eastern Australia and Laurentia until rifting and Rodinia break-up in the middle Neoproterozoic (Li et al., 2008, 2011)If the arc-related model is correct, a likely scenario for the origin of the Amdo basement (and the Qiangtang and/or Lhasa terranes) is as part of the continental arc that rifted off either during back-arc extension or in the initial stages of Rodinia break-up
Not only do the Amdo orthogneiss ages match with the South China granite ages, but the primary age group of the Amdo paragneiss detrital zircons is 1000– 750 Ma, similar to the main age peak of Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic sedimentary rocks from the South China block (Fig8).
The other primary regions of early Neoproterozoic magmatism are on the Indian plate and in Antarctica (Fig9)
9), though most of the dated magmatism is in the 850– 700 Ma range (Deb et al., 2001; Pandit et al., 2003; Buick et al., 2006; Meert et al., 2010), and 1000–800 Ma detrital zircons are abundant in mid-Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the nearby Vindhyanchal Basin (Malone et al., 2008)There is also early Neoproterozoic magmatism and metamorphism in the Eastern Ghats of India (Mezger and Cosca, 1999), as well as the Prince Charles Mountains and Rayner/Napier complex of Antarctica (Boger et al., 2000; Fitzsimons, 2003; Boger and Miller, 2004), though the younger 900–800 Ma ages have not been documented in these regions
There is also early Neoproterozoic magmatism and metamorphism in the Eastern Ghats of India (Mezger and Cosca, 1999), as well as the Prince Charles Mountains and Rayner/Napier complex of Antarctica (Boger et al., 2000; Fitzsimons, 2003; Boger and Miller, 2004), though the younger 900–800 Ma ages have not been documented in these regionsBoth the Aravalli–Delhi craton and the Eastern Ghats have a smaller volume of early Neoproterozoic granites than the South China block
Both the Aravalli–Delhi craton and the Eastern Ghats have a smaller volume of early Neoproterozoic granites than the South China blockIn addition, taking into account the extent of India consumed by the Indo-Asian collision (Greater India), if the Amdo basement was located along India’s margin in the Neoproterozoic it would have been over 1000 km from the Aravalli–Delhi craton
In addition, taking into account the extent of India consumed by the Indo-Asian collision (Greater India), if the Amdo basement was located along India’s margin in the Neoproterozoic it would have been over 1000 km from the Aravalli–Delhi cratonFurthermore, the detrital age spectra of the paragneiss is quite different from Proterozoic rocks of the Himalaya, suggesting they were not co-located
Furthermore, the detrital age spectra of the paragneiss is quite different from Proterozoic rocks of the Himalaya, suggesting they were not co-locatedThe Greater Himalayan Sequence is dominated by Grenville ages and contains few Neoproterozoic ages while the Lesser Himalayan Sequence is dominated by 2000– 1800 Ma zircons with a peak at 1900 Ma (Gehrels et al., 2003a).
The Greater Himalayan Sequence is dominated by Grenville ages and contains few Neoproterozoic ages while the Lesser Himalayan Sequence is dominated by 2000– 1800 Ma zircons with a peak at 1900 Ma (Gehrels et al., 2003a).In general, the scarcity of data for the Neoproterozoic, the many continental fragments that comprised Gondwana and the longitudinal ambiguity of paleomagnetic data all make placing Gondwanan terranes in a pre-Gondwanan paleogeographic framework difficult

Nonetheless, we think the available data suggest that the Amdo basement, and therefore the Qiangtang and/or Lhasa terranes, were located adjacent to the margin of the Yangtze block and rifted off in the middle Neoproterozoic before amalgamating with East Gondwana.The younger suite of Amdo orthogneiss intruded the older basement between 540 and 460 Ma (Table 1)
Cambro-Ordovician granitoid ages have also been documented in the Qiangtang terrane (Kapp et al., 2000; Pullen et al., 2011)In the Lhasa terrane, Kapp et al
(2005a) reported 550 Ma inherited zircons from Cretaceous-Tertiary granitoids and orthogneisses of the Nyainqentanglha mountains.Cambro-Ordovician granitoids, emplaced following Pan-African orogenesis and Gondwana assembly, are ubiquitous along the margins of Gondwana and in Gondwanan terranes (Veevers, 2004)
Cambro-Ordovician granitoids, emplaced following Pan-African orogenesis and Gondwana assembly, are ubiquitous along the margins of Gondwana and in Gondwanan terranes (Veevers, 2004)They occur in Turkey (Gessner et al., 2004; Ustaömer et al., 2009), Iran (Hassanzadeh et al., 2008), the Arabian–Nubian shield (Stern, 1994), Madagascar (Tucker et al., 1999; Collins et al., 2003), the Himalaya (Schärer and Allègre, 1983; Garzanti et al., 1986; Le Fort, 1986; Lee et al., 2000; Godin et al., 2001; Gehrels et al., 2003a; Cawood et al., 2007; Visonà et al., 2010), and the northwestern Indochina peninsula (Liu et al
The Himalayan granitoids, combined with CambroOrdovician metamorphic monazite ages from rocks of the Greater Himalaya Sequence, have been used to suggest a tectonic event along the Indian margin at this time (e.gGehrels et al
(2007) and references therein) and may have been related to a reorganization of plate boundaries following Gondwana amalgamation during the late Neoproterozoic (Boger and Miller, 2004; Cawood et al., 2007).Cawood et al
(2007) noted that after taking into account Cenozoic shortening, the Himalayan granitoids indicate an extraordinarily wide orogen (over 700 km), similar to the coeval Ross– Delamarian orogeny in AustraliaIf the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes were located in the same approximate longitudinal position along the Indian margin as today, the Amdo basement would extend that width to over 1100 km, taking into account 50 percent shortening of the Lhasa terrane during the Cretaceous and Tertiary (Kapp et al., 2005b)
If the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes were located in the same approximate longitudinal position along the Indian margin as today, the Amdo basement would extend that width to over 1100 km, taking into account 50 percent shortening of the Lhasa terrane during the Cretaceous and Tertiary (Kapp et al., 2005b)An alternative and more plausible scenario is that these terranes were not spatially associated with northern India
Another possibility, which we prefer, is that they were outboard from India at the end of the Neoproterozoic after rifting off of the South China block, and then collided with the northern margin of East Gondwana causing the Cambro-Ordovician orogenesis observed in the Himalaya (Cawood et al., 2007)Regardless, the Cambro-Ordovician granitoids in terranes of central and southern Tibet indicate that they were involved in the Cambro-Ordovician tectono-magmatic events along the northern margin of Gondwana.

Amdo quartzite and Lhasa–Qiangtang late Paleozoic detrital zircon signatureThe detrital zircon age spectra of the two quartzite samples are quite similar to each other (Fig
6) and both have a maximum depositional age in the Ordovician, so we regard these as approximately coevalSandstones and low-grade quartzites of Carboniferous–Permian age are widely exposed across the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes (Leeder et al., 1988; Yin et al., 1988; Pan et al., 2004) and comparing a combined Amdo quartzite spectrum to combined age spectra of Carboniferous–Permian samples from the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes (Fig
Sandstones and low-grade quartzites of Carboniferous–Permian age are widely exposed across the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes (Leeder et al., 1988; Yin et al., 1988; Pan et al., 2004) and comparing a combined Amdo quartzite spectrum to combined age spectra of Carboniferous–Permian samples from the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes (Fig8) reveals that they all have a similar age signature, particularly for the Qiangtang, sharing common 600–500 Ma ages, 1000–900 Ma ages and peaks around 2500 Ma
This suggests that the Amdo quartzite protoliths were late Paleozoic sandstones, with the protoliths of the associated marbles and schists likely being Paleozoic carbonates and mudstones deposited together on a passive margin.The lack of middle to late Paleozoic zircons in upper Paleozoic Gondwanan sedimentary rocks appears to be a common trait
The lack of middle to late Paleozoic zircons in upper Paleozoic Gondwanan sedimentary rocks appears to be a common traitOf a total of 878 zircons from eleven samples of Lhasa and Qiangtang Carboniferous–Permian sandstone, only two are younger than Ordovician and several samples have maximum ages in the Cambrian, similar to the quartzites
Of a total of 878 zircons from eleven samples of Lhasa and Qiangtang Carboniferous–Permian sandstone, only two are younger than Ordovician and several samples have maximum ages in the Cambrian, similar to the quartzitesThis same pattern is seen in six samples of Permian sandstone from the Perth Basin in western Australia, where only four out of 310 zircons have ages younger than Ordovician (Cawood and Nemchin, 2000), as well as in rocks of the Ordovician–Devonian Tethyan Himalayan Sequence and the Permo-Jurassic rocks of Indian rifts (Fig

The lack of middle to late Paleozoic zircons is probably a result of magmatic quiescence during the development of a passive margin along northern Gondwana following Cambro-Ordovician tectonism and prior to Permo-Triassic rifting.5.4
Paleozoic detrital zircon signatures and paleogeographyOutside of the major continents, the location of terranes within Gondwana is not well known and has become an increasing source of debate, partly driven by the recent collection of detrital zircon data
Some recent reconstructions have placed the Lhasa terrane next to northwest Australia in the late Permian (Ferrari et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2010)Ferrari et al
(2008) locate it there in the early Paleozoic, while Zhu et al(2010) have it isolated outboard of Gondwana prior to Middle Permian accretion and keep the Qiangtang terrane directly adjacent to India
(2010) have it isolated outboard of Gondwana prior to Middle Permian accretion and keep the Qiangtang terrane directly adjacent to IndiaThe latter requires that the Qiangtang terrane was south of the Lhasa terrane during the Permian, which is not supported by the available paleomagnetic data (Li et al., 2004).
The latter requires that the Qiangtang terrane was south of the Lhasa terrane during the Permian, which is not supported by the available paleomagnetic data (Li et al., 2004).While Ferrari et al
(2010) place the Lhasa terrane next to northwest Australia, in many traditional reconstructions West Burma, Sibumasu and other Indochina terranes have been placed along this margin in the Paleozoic due to similarities in flora, fauna and stratigraphy (e.gMetcalfe, 1996, 2006)
Other authors have recently suggested that the South China block was located adjacent to northwest Australia prior to rifting in the Late Devonian (Yu et al., 2008; Roger et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2010b; Duan et al., 2011)Alternatively, the South China block has been placed between eastern Australia and Laurentia (Li et al., 2008, 2011), outboard of the Arabian–Nubian shield (Ferrari et al., 2008) or even next to northwest India with the North China block next to northeast India and northwest Australia (Scotese, 2001; McKenzie et al., 2011)
In order to use the Amdo, Qiangtang and Lhasa detrital zircon spectra for placing the terranes in a paleogeographic framework, we compare them to the composite detrital zircon age spectra of other rocks deposited during the late Neoproterozoic to late Paleozoic from different Gondwanan continents and terranes (Figs8 and 9)
These Cambrian rocks contain one major group of 800–550 Ma ages that is a direct result of being sourced from the Arabian–Nubian shield which contains large volumes of middle-late Neoproterozoic magmatism (Wilde and Youssef, 2002; Avigad et al., 2003; Kolodner et al., 2006; Hassanzadeh et al., 2008)While the East Gondwana Paleozoic rocks have some ages within this range, this major peak is not represented and there are relatively few ages, especially in the 700–600 Ma range, indicating that little detritus from the Arabian–Nubian shield made it to the northern margin of India, possibly as a result of a major orogenic drainage divide created during the Pan-African collision of India with Africa (Fig
While the East Gondwana Paleozoic rocks have some ages within this range, this major peak is not represented and there are relatively few ages, especially in the 700–600 Ma range, indicating that little detritus from the Arabian–Nubian shield made it to the northern margin of India, possibly as a result of a major orogenic drainage divide created during the Pan-African collision of India with Africa (Fig9)
The predominance of Grenville ages suggests that East Gondwana is the most likely source for the Himalayan sediments, in particular orogenic provinces in eastern India, western and southern Australia and Antarctica (Yoshida and Upreti, 2006; Cawood et al., 2007), similar to Permian sandstones from the Perth Basin (Cawood and Nemchin, 2000) and Permian–Jurassic rocks from east Indian rift basins (Veevers and Saeed, 2009) (Figs8 and 9).
600–500 Ma detrital zircon ages are common to all East Gondwanan sedimentary rocks as a result of the extensive late Neoproterozoic–Ordovician magmatismTherefore these ages are not very useful for determining sediment sources and terrane paleogeography.
Outside of the 600–500 Ma ages, the largest peak is generallyeither between 1000 and 850 Ma or between 1250 and 1000 Ma, with the exception of upper Paleozoic rocks from the Lhasa terrane which have a fairly even distribution of 1250–950 Ma agesWhile the spectra have peaks in one or the other of these two groups of ages, most contain ages from both groups, making the difference relatively subtle
The 1250–1000 Ma ages are Grenville and the most likely sources are the late Mesoproterozoic orogenies of western Australia, west Antarctica and possibly eastern India (Boger et al., 2000; Fitzsimons, 2000, 2003; Condie, 2003; Meert and Torsvik, 2003; Cox et al., 2004; Veevers et al., 2005), which have already been proposed as the source region for the Greater Himalayan Sequence (Yoshida and Upreti, 2006; Cawood et al., 2007)The Prince Charles Mountains of Antarctica (Boger et al., 2000; Fitzsimons, 2003) and the Eastern Ghats of India (Mezger and Cosca, 1999) are a possible source for 1000–950 Ma ages, as well as the possibility of undated basement of Greater India, Tibet and western Australia
These as well as younger 850– 750 Ma ages are also common to the South China block, which some reconstructions suggest was located next to India in the early Paleozoic (Metcalfe, 1996, 2006; Scotese, 2001)However, even these models rift South China from Australia by the end of the Devonian and since the same 1000–850 Ma ages occur in upper Paleozoic Gondwanan rocks, this requires either an alternate source or recycled lower Paleozoic rocks.
However, even these models rift South China from Australia by the end of the Devonian and since the same 1000–850 Ma ages occur in upper Paleozoic Gondwanan rocks, this requires either an alternate source or recycled lower Paleozoic rocks.The spectra contain small but statistically significant populations of middle Neoproterozoic (800–600 Ma) and PaleoMesoproterozoic (2400–1300 Ma) age peaks which generally do not correlate across regions
The spectra contain small but statistically significant populations of middle Neoproterozoic (800–600 Ma) and PaleoMesoproterozoic (2400–1300 Ma) age peaks which generally do not correlate across regionsThe small size of these peaks suggests either local sources of minor magmatic volumes or recycled zircons from older sedimentary strata
On the other hand, this age signature is also largely missing from Permian–Jurassic sediments deposited in Permian rifts of eastern India (Veevers and Saeed, 2009), implying that other mechanisms may be responsible for the lack of a strong interior India signature from Greater Indian and Tibetan rocksSimilarly, Permian sandstones of the southwest Australian Perth basin lack a strong Yilgarn cratonic signature (Cawood and Nemchin, 2000)
Similarly, Permian sandstones of the southwest Australian Perth basin lack a strong Yilgarn cratonic signature (Cawood and Nemchin, 2000)It is likely that tectonic events, collisional in the early Paleozoic and extensional in the late Paleozoic, produced topography that prevented significant drainage from the interior of the continents to the shelf.
It is likely that tectonic events, collisional in the early Paleozoic and extensional in the late Paleozoic, produced topography that prevented significant drainage from the interior of the continents to the shelf.The spectra typically contain only one or two small though significant age peaks in the late Archean-earliest Paleoproterozoic
The spectra typically contain only one or two small though significant age peaks in the late Archean-earliest PaleoproterozoicAgain, older Archean ages common to the interior cratons are not common in the age spectra.
Again, older Archean ages common to the interior cratons are not common in the age spectra.In summary, the East Gondwanan sedimentary rocks display a wide range of detrital zircon ages but are dominated by 1250– 850 and 600–500 Ma ages derived from orogenic belts rather than cratonic interiors
These ages imply a wide range of sediment sources for East Gondwana during the Paleozoic including distal mountain ranges and probably recycled Proterozoic sedimentary rocksThis wide ranging provenance makes it difficult to use the detrital zircon age signatures to definitively place terranes within Eastern Gondwana.
The Amdo and Qiangtang spectra have distinct 1000–900 Ma age peaks, while the Nyingtri samples of the Lhasa terrane have a distinct 1200–1000 Ma group of ages and the Lhasa terrane upper Paleozoic spectrum has diffuse ages across the 1250–900 Ma age range (Fig8)
Cambrian samples collected further east in the Himalaya (Nepal and Bhutan) by Myrow et al(2010) appear to have a similar provenance as the northwest Indian rocks, although this signature is dissimilar from the Nepalese Himalayan rocks in Gehrels et al
The lack of 1000–900 Ma ages in the western Himalaya and Qiangtang terrane may reflect a more westerly location of the Qiangtang terrane relative to the Lhasa terrane along Gondwana’s margin, farther from the early Neoproterozoic orogens of East Gondwana.Orthogneisses from the Amdo basement reveal two periods of magmatism, one in the early Neoproterozoic (920–820 Ma) and another in the Cambro-Ordovician (540–460 Ma)
Orthogneisses from the Amdo basement reveal two periods of magmatism, one in the early Neoproterozoic (920–820 Ma) and another in the Cambro-Ordovician (540–460 Ma)Neoproterozoic magmatism is also recorded in the Lhasa terrane southwest of Amdo while evidence of Cambro-Ordovician magmatism, common in East Gondwana terranes, has also been found in other places within the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes
Neoproterozoic magmatism is also recorded in the Lhasa terrane southwest of Amdo while evidence of Cambro-Ordovician magmatism, common in East Gondwana terranes, has also been found in other places within the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranesThe available geochronologic data indicate that the basement of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes is Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic in age.
The available geochronologic data indicate that the basement of the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes is Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic in age.Two quartzite samples from the Amdo basement have similar detrital zircon age signatures and maximum depositional ages, indicating they are coeval
Their age spectra are very similar to Carboniferous–Permian sandstones that are widespread across the Qiangtang and Lhasa terranes, suggesting their protoliths were late Paleozoic in age.We propose that the Amdo basement, and therefore possibly the Qiangtang and Lhasa terranes, originated from the Yangtze block of South China during the Neoproterozoic before amalgamating to Gondwana during the early Paleozoic, based on similarities in magmatic and detrital zircon ages

The Amdo basement and its associated terrane(s), Qiangtang and/or Lhasa, could have rifted off during mid-Neoproterozoic extension of the South China block, as a result of back-arc rifting or continental break-upHowever, magmatism of this age also occurs in the Aravalli–Delhi craton of eastern India and in Antarctica and more data are required for a confirmation of our proposed link to South China.
The later period of Cambro-Ordovician magmatism is widespread along the former margins of East Gondwana from Turkey to AustraliaThis magmatism was the result of oceanic subduction along continental margins of the newly formed supercontinent Gondwana as well as possibly terrane collisions (DeCelles et al., 2000; Gehrels et al., 2003a) in response to plate reorganization following Gondwana assembly (Boger and Miller, 2004; Cawood et al., 2007)
The presence of this magmatism in central Tibet indicates these terranes were associated with East Gondwana in the early Paleozoic, either as part of an exceptionally wide active continental margin similar to the North American Cordillera or the Australian Ross–Delamerian Orogeny (Cawood et al., 2007) or as terranes that collided with India at this time, creating the Cambro-Ordovician orogeny of the Himalaya (Gehrels et al., 2003a).The detrital zircon age signatures of upper Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic rocks of East Gondwanan are not very distinct, which unfortunately limits their usefulness for determining paleogeography
The detrital zircon age signatures of upper Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic rocks of East Gondwanan are not very distinct, which unfortunately limits their usefulness for determining paleogeographyThere is a suggestion in the data that Tibetan and Himalayan rocks may have a provenance difference from east to west, with more late Mesoproterozoic ages to the east and more early Neoproterozoic ages to the west, but the difference is subtle and Myrow et al
There is a suggestion in the data that Tibetan and Himalayan rocks may have a provenance difference from east to west, with more late Mesoproterozoic ages to the east and more early Neoproterozoic ages to the west, but the difference is subtle and Myrow et al(2010) argue for a well-mixed signature along the Greater Indian margin in the early Paleozoic
(2010) argue for a well-mixed signature along the Greater Indian margin in the early PaleozoicIf detrital zircon data are to be used for better constraining East Gondwanan paleogeography, it will require a finer resolution of spatial and temporal trends in magmagenesis and sedimentary provenance.
