Specifically, the lack of a topographic barrier between the Western Interior Seaway and the Appalachian Mountains, the presence of isolated middle Cretaceous coarse-grained strata widespread across eastern North America, and a lack of middle Cretaceous sediments in the Mississippi Embayment strata south of the Ouachita uplands all suggest that a transcontinental fluvial system could have flowed from east to west across the continent during middle Cretaceous time.Four samples were collected from Dakota Formation outcrops located in western Iowa and eastern Nebraska

Paleocurrent indicators and provenance studies from Albian and Cenomanian strata in the Bighorn Basin demonstrate that the development of the foldand-thrust belt created new sediment sources and increased sediment flux from the western margin of the evolving Cordilleran foreland basin (DeCelles, 2004)Existing detrital zircon data from the Bighorn Basin provide evidence that most of the sediment in the foredeep was derived from the adjacent fold-and-thrust belt (May et al., 2013).
