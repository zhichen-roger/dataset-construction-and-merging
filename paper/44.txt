Carbonate sedimentology and reservoir quality prediction has developed in major ways based upon the study of modern (Holocene) sedimentary analogues (Dravis 1979; McClain et al1992; Whittle et al
(a) Termination of fault/fracture controlled dolomite body, Lower Carboniferous Limestone, North Wales PlatformDolomitized beds are located beneath thin, low permeability beds and terminate sharply against fractures
(b) Fracture-controlled calcite cementation in Upper Devonian Balnagown Group (aeolian facies of the Gaza Formation) at Tarbert Ness in NE ScotlandThe fracture has led to localized calcite cementation of the sandstone owing to an influx of cementing species but the effect is limited to the near-fracture (proximal) region since the new cement closed pores and limited advective influx into the more distal parts of the sandstone
