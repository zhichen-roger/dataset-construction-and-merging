The key focus of this paper is to investigate further the issues of crystallography and quartz cement growth mechanisms, using the shallowly buried Oligo-Miocene Fontainebleau sandstone, France, as a case studyWe address the following points: (1) are authigenic quartz overgrowths really in crystallographic continuity with their substrate grains? (2) What is the crystallographic inter-relationship between zones of quartz cement growth? (3) Are all quartz overgrowths entirely quartz, or do other silica polymorphs exist within overgrowths? The study combines an array of techniques to answer these questions, including transmitted-light optics, cathodoluminescence (CL), and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), the latter of the two being performed with the use of a scanning electron microscope (SEM)
Waugh (1970) studied the Permian Penrith Sandstone and documented the development of optically continuous quartz from detrital grains to overgrowthsIn Waugh’s model to explain these data, initial crystal growth begins with numerous projections of aligned rhombohedral and prismatic quartz forming over the surface of the detrital monocrystalline grain
The Fontainebleau sandstone is an early Oligocene (36–27 Ma) unit, 50–80 m thick, of fine-grained, well-sorted, quartz arenite which rests on top of Eocene–Oligocene marls and is overlain by Oligo-Miocene limestones (Fig1; Cooper 1994; Thiry et al
The quartz-cemented horizons are reported to have formed from silicification controlled by water-table variations in a recent (Pliocene–Quaternary) hydrogeological event, related to spring lines (Thiry et al1988)
Quartz overgrowths of the Oligo-Miocene Fontainebleau sandstone reveal contrasting overgrowth stylesSample 1 has homogeneous overgrowth character, as defined by bland CL response; sample 2 has heterogeneous overgrowth character as defined by four discernible overgrowth zones.
