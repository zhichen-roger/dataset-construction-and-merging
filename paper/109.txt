Sandstone-hosted concretions record evidence for syn-lithification seismicity, cavitation processes, and Palaeocene rapid burial of Lower Cretaceous deepmarine sandstones (Outer Moray Firth, UK North Sea)School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Portsmouth, Burnaby Building, Burnaby Road,
Abstract: Syn- and post-lithification cemented fractures are abundant in concretions formed during shallow burial of Hauterivian turbidites in the Outer Moray FirthEarly fractures are irregular, bifurcating, and contain entrained sand grains
This paper will describe interdependent fracturing and cementation patterns in early diagenetic concretions from a Lower Cretaceous deep marine sandstone oil reservoirPreviously undescribed, shallow burial deformation microfabrics will be interpreted in terms of hydraulic fracturing–cementation cycles in partially lithified host sediment subjected to repeated seismic activity and associated fluid cavitation
Sandstones examined in this investigation are from the Lower Cretaceous Scapa Member of the Valhall Formation, and specifically from the Hauterivian age ‘SD’ reservoir intervalThey are located in the Scapa Field on the southern margin of the Witch Ground Graben (Block 14/19, Outer Moray Firth, UK North Sea), at present-day depths of 8870–12715 ft (2702–3873 m)
Thermal evolution was incorporated in the model assuming conductive heat transfer with comparable heat-flow values for the Cenozoic–Tertiary and present dayResults show episodes of rapid subsidence in the early Cretaceous and late Palaeocene, and maximum burial temperatures in the Scapa Member of 90– 95 8C

Furthermore, late Cretaceous and Tertiary subsidence in the Outer Moray Firth was dominated by thermal sag and sediment loading rather than extensional tectonism (Andrews et al1990).
A similar burial diagenetic assemblage, attributed to Palaeocene fluid flow, is present in some other late Mesozoic reservoirs of the Outer Moray Firth (e.gMcCants & Burley 1996).
Early diagenetic calcite concretions in Lower Cretaceous Scapa sandstones host syn- and post-lithification fractures that record the evolving rheology of the system during shallow to deep burial, and active rifting to thermal subsidenceFractures do not penetrate the surrounding porous sandstone.
