The formation has been considered Oligocene in age and is commonly interpreted as an Epiligurian unit, unconformably deposited above the Val Marecchia Nappe during its transport towards the Adriatic foreland.The Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm rests on the Argille Varicolori Fm of the Val Marecchia Nappe, but field data do not allow it to be recognized wherever it abruptly replaces the pelagic sediments of the Argille Varicolori Fm, thus testifying to the foredeep evolution of the basin, or where it unconformably overlies this latter formation.
Nannofossil assemblages are characterized by abundant reworked Cretaceous and Paleogene taxa and by some taxa, whose first occurrence is reported in the upper part of the NN4 Zone = upper part of the CN3 ZoneTherefore the formation must be considered not older than Langhian.
Therefore the formation must be considered not older than Langhian.Detrital modes of arenites revealed a quartz-feldspathic composition and the lithic component includes mainly metamorphic fragments and minor plutonic, sedimentary, ophiolithic and volcanic clasts

TERMINI CHIAVE: Biostratigrafia, Langhiano, Petrografia del sedimentario, Arenarie di Poggio Carnaio, Falda della Val Marecchia, Appennino Settentrionale.The Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm consists of an arenaceous and arenaceous-pelitic turbiditic succession, cropping out between San Piero in Bagno and Santa Sofia, on the watershed of the Savio and Bidente valleys (Romagnan Apennines; fig
The Val Marecchia Nappe is characterized by Jurassic ophiolites (basalts and more or less serpentinized peridotites, cut by gabbroic dykes; PLESI et alii, 2002), followed by a Meso-Cenozoic cover consisting of pelagic rocks and calcareous as well as siliciclastic turbidites (CONTI, 1994)Some strips of clastic formations, deposited in thrust-top basins during the orogenic transport towards the Adriatic foreland, rest unconformably above the sedimentary cover (Epiligurian successions;
1), including some Oligocene arenitic formations (Poggio Carnaio and Monte Comero Sandstone Fms)Later, this age was further supported by RUGGIERI (1958; 1970), who recognized Oligocene microfaunas
Later, this age was further supported by RUGGIERI (1958; 1970), who recognized Oligocene microfaunasPASSERINI (1958) interpreted the Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm as a part of an allochthonous unit and first pointed out its lithological and petrological features
Later, the Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm was commonly interpreted as an Oligocene Epiligurian successsion, sensu RICCI LUCCHI (1987b)The formation was mapped at the 1: 50.000 scale by the Geological Survey of the Emilia-Romagna Region and considered to be deposited between the late Oligocene and the base of the Miocene, although fossils, testifying to this age, are not cited (BENINI et alii, 1991; MARTELLI, 1994)

The formation is included in the Valle del Savio Unit, considered a sedimentary melange, consisting mainly of pelitic rocks that had gravitationally slid into the basin of the UmbroMarchean Marnoso-Arenacea Fm during the late TortonianThis innovative interpretation may be questioned, taking into account that the Valle del Savio Unit of BENINI et alii (1991) and MARTELLI (1994) is in physical continuity with the bulk of the Val Marecchia Nappe (fig
The authors shared the interpretation of PLESI et alii (2002) as to the ophiolitic substratum and the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous formations (Diaspri, Calpionella Limestone and Palombini Shale), forming the lower part of the nappe, but proposed different age and development for the upper part of the successionIt continues with the Sillano Fm (Upper Cretaceous-Eocene), Monte Morello Fm (Oligocene), Argille Varicolori Fm (upper Oligocene-lower Miocene) and Monte Senario Sandstone Fm (lower Miocene)
It continues with the Sillano Fm (Upper Cretaceous-Eocene), Monte Morello Fm (Oligocene), Argille Varicolori Fm (upper Oligocene-lower Miocene) and Monte Senario Sandstone Fm (lower Miocene)In particular, the Argille Varicolori Fm, usually considered Cretaceous in age and heteropic with the lower part of the Sillano Fm, was found to be late Oligocene-Aquitanian in age and stratigraphically continuous with the turbiditic Monte Senario Sandstone Fm
In particular, the Argille Varicolori Fm, usually considered Cretaceous in age and heteropic with the lower part of the Sillano Fm, was found to be late Oligocene-Aquitanian in age and stratigraphically continuous with the turbiditic Monte Senario Sandstone FmThis latter represents the highest formation of the stratigraphic succession and testifies to the foredeep stage of the Val Marecchia basin during the early Miocene
This latter represents the highest formation of the stratigraphic succession and testifies to the foredeep stage of the Val Marecchia basin during the early MioceneWhen this stratigraphic succession is taken into account, the Val Marecchia Nappe is considered as originated from the Sub-ligurian Domain and not from the easternmost zone of the External Ligurian Domain
CIBIN et alii (2001) and ZATTIN & ZUFFA (2004) evidenced an origin from Pennidic and Australpine nappes of the Central-Western Alps for the turbiditic succession of Northern Apennines, but highlighted significant petrographic differences between the Miocene successions deposited in foredeep or thrust-top basinsSo, we tried to verify both the age and composition of the Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm
Clearly reworked Cretaceous and Paleogene taxa, very common and prevailing in many samples, have been omitted.Nannofossil assemblages are characterized by the occurrence of some taxa (Discoaster cf
The formation, therefore, as from the basal beds is not older than Langhian.The nannofossil assemblages recognized in the Monte Senario Sandstone Fm
However, the occurrence of Sphenolithus belemnos allows the formation to be assigned an age not older than the middle Burdigalian.Calcareous nannofossils of the Poggio del Carnaio Sandstone Fm.
The Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm has an age not older than Langhian and geometrically lies above the Argille Varicolori Fm of the north-western corner of the Val Marecchia NappeThe field study did not enable us to establish whether the Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm evidences a sudden change in the sedimentation, marking the beginning of the foredeep stage in the basin in which the Argille Varicolori Fm deposited, or whether it represents an Epiligurian unit sedimented unconformably on the Argille Varicolori Fm after its deformation
The Argille Varicolori Fm is late Oligocene-Aquitanian in age and affected by an intense deformation, whereas the Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm is Langhian, or younger, and characterized by a bedding which is regular and parallel to the basal boundary.The interpretation of the Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm as an Epiligurian unit is also supported by its petrographic features and by a comparison with the Monte Senario Sandstone Fm, this latter representing the foredeep sediments of the Val Marecchia basin
In conclusion, from the data available, the most probable interpretation considers the Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm as a Langhian, or younger, Epiligurian unit, sedimented in a thrust-top basin, located on the Val Marecchia Nappe, during the orogenic transport of this nappe towards the Adriatic foreland.The Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm was supplied from the erosion of a source area consisting of prevailing metamorphic rocks (mainly phyllites and metasediments), acidic plutonites, Ligurian-like and HP/LT ophiolitic complexes and pelagic sedimentary covers (micritic limestones, shales, cherts, siltstones, etc.)
All the rock complexes which fed the Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm are present in the Northern Apennines nappe stack because, besides Ligurian-type ophiolitic complexes, H-P ophiolites crop out in Tuscany (RICCI, 1972; DECANDIA & LAZZAROTTO, 1980) and continental crust rocks (granitoids, phyllites, micaschists, but also acidic granulites) have been recognized in the Upper Cretaceous sedimentary melanges of some External Ligurian Units (Monte Penna-Casanova, Monte Ragola etcComplexes;
However, according to our data, the origin of the siliciclastic supply which fed the Oligo-Miocene turbiditic successions of Northern Apennines appears to represent a problem generally underestimated in the proposed models of the Northern Apennines evolutionWe believe that this problem can be solved only in a regional framework wider than this orogenic sector
The clastic supply of the Northern Apennines is usually related to the erosion of the chain of the Alps, but it is difficult to admit a provenance of a huge amount of siliciclastic supply, continuous from the late Oligocene to the Messinian, from the Alpine ChainMoreover, an abundant siliciclastic supply is present also in the Central and Southern Apennines, where it is locally characterized by large boulders, as the m3-sized blocks of granitoids in the Messinian deposits near Campobasso (CARRARA & SERVA, 1982).
Moreover, an abundant siliciclastic supply is present also in the Central and Southern Apennines, where it is locally characterized by large boulders, as the m3-sized blocks of granitoids in the Messinian deposits near Campobasso (CARRARA & SERVA, 1982).In conclusion, the Alps, and also the Sardinia-Corsican Massif, cannot be considered the source areas for most of the clastic formations of Northern Apennines (Macigno, Cervarola, Marnoso-arenacea, Laga Fms, etc.), as instead admitted
Our data imply that units similar to the Pennidic and Australpine Units of the Alps and Calabria-Peloritani Arc, at present fully eroded, probably represented the geometrically highest units in the Palaeo-Apennine Chain and fed the siliciclastic supply for the Oligo-Miocene turbiditic successions, including the Poggio Carnaio Sandstone basinOn the other hand, the hypothesis that the Alpine Chain was an orogenic belt formerly continuous from the Alps to the Calabria-Peloritani Arc, later dismembered by the opening of the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian basin, has been widely shared, as in HACCARD et alii (1972), ALVAREZ et alii (1974), and ALVAREZ (1976)
The hypothesis of Pennidic and Australpine units at the top of the Palaeo-Apennine Chain is also supported by the occurrence, just in the Northern Apennines, of gravels and pebbles of granitoids, augengneisses, amphibole-gneisses, amphibolites, garnetsillimanite gneisses and granulites, in some foredeep successions (PANDELI et alii, 1997) and mainly in the Pliocene conglomerates of the Adriatic piedmont belt.This research was supported by MIUR-PRIN 06 research project 2006 «Cenozoic clastic sedimentation in the southern branch of the Tethys in the Betic-Rifian Arc and northern Apennines: consequences for the palaeogeographic and palaeotectonic evolution of the central-western Mediterranean»
