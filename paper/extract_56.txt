In the Antofagasta de la Sierra region of NW Argentina, data from sedimentary geology, sandstone modal composition, detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, and apatite fission-track and (U-Th-Sm)/He thermochronology indicate that sediments accumulated in the late Eocene to early Oligocene, with a maximum depositional age of ca39–38 Ma provided by the youngest detrital zircon U-Pb dates

For example, various models have been proposed to explain the Cenozoic evolution of the Central Andean Plateau (Fig1), an important example of an orogenic system on a noncollisional plate boundary, including: distributed deformation along inherited crustal heterogeneities (e.g., Carrera et al., 2006; Grier et al., 1991; Hongn et al., 2007; Iaffa et al., 2013; Kley et al., 1999, 2005; Monaldi et al., 2008); range uplift modulated by deposition and erosion (e.g., Sobel and Strecker, 2003; Sobel et al., 2003; Hilley and Strecker, 2005); surface uplift, subsidence, contraction, or extension caused by lower lithosphere founder ing (e.g., DeCelles et al., 2015a; Garzione et al., 2008; Schoenbohm and Carrapa, 2015; Zhou and Schoenbohm, 2015); and formation of a foreland basin through lithospheric flexure (e.g., Jordan and Alonso, 1987; Horton, 2005; DeCelles et al., 2011)

The first class of models emphasizes the reactivation of pree xisting crustal heterogeneities, such as inherited deep­seated faults created during Cretaceous riftingIn the model, as the region underwent Cenozoic shortening, the availability of these weaknesses led to range uplift distributed across a broad region (e.g., Hongn et al., 2007; Sobel et al., 2003; Strecker et al., 2012)

We argue that, during the late Eocene to early Oligocene, lithospheric flexure was the dominant deformation mechanism in the southern Puna, based on the geometry of the basin (this study; Zhou et al., 2016)The proximal source region of this basin, the Sierra Quebrada Honda, marked the location of the orogenic strain front during the late Eocene to early Oligocene (Fig

First, studies in the northern Puna and the Altiplano place the orogenic strain front in the western plateau during the late Eocene (e.g., Carrapa et al., 2011; DeCelles and Horton, 2003; McQuarrie et al., 2005; Uba et al., 2006), requiring a map­view deflection of orogenic strain front from the northern to the southern Puna (Figs14A and 14C)

Second, the Sierra Chango Real, the proposed eastern boundary of the early basin (Zhou et al., 2016), yields late Eocene AFT ages (Coutand et al., 2001), suggesting exhumation during the formation of this basinThis location was active, yet it was ~180 km east of the proposed orogenic strain front.

We suggest that these two apparent conflicts may be resolved by invoking a role for inherited cratonic structures in modulating the propagation of the Cenozoic strain frontThe Cretaceous rift developed mostly in the northern Puna Plateau and its Eastern Cordi llera, covering both regions with thick Cretaceous rift deposits (Marquillas et al., 2005)

The Cretaceous rift developed mostly in the northern Puna Plateau and its Eastern Cordi llera, covering both regions with thick Cretaceous rift deposits (Marquillas et al., 2005)Rift structures are prone to reactivation during shortening (e.g., Carrera et al., 2006; Hongn et al., 2007)

In the Eastern Cordillera of the northern Puna, shortening may have preferentially activated the inherited Cretaceous riftrelated faults (e.g., Hongn et al., 2007; Carrera et al., 2006); syndepositional deformation in the Quebrada de los Colorados Formation is in line with this inference (del Papa et al., 2013)Although Cretaceous rift deposits are not present in the southern Puna (e.g., M arquillas et al., 2005), thermochronologic data document Cretaceous cooling of several ranges on the eastern margin (e.g., La Quebrada; Carrapa et al., 2014), suggesting that the rift shoulders may have extended onto the plateau

Alternatively, the southern Puna may indeed lack significant rift structures, but may instead dominantly host relict Paleozoic topography, supported by the observed Paleozoic zircon (U­Th­Sm)/He ages from the bedrock ranges in the southern Puna (Carrapa and DeCelles, 2015; Reiners et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2014)The lack of rift­related faults may position the southern Puna less favorably for accommodating large amounts of Cenozoic shortening, impeding the ~W­E propagation of Cenozoic deformation through the southern Central Andean Plateau (Fig

Sandstone modal composition, detrital zircon U­Pb ages, and modeled bedrock AFT data are consistent with the onset of sedimentary accumulation in multiple locations in the Southern Central Andean Plateau in the late Eocene to early OligoceneThese new data support the inference that the entire southern Puna was occupied by a regional, asymmetric sedimentary basin during the late Eocene to early Oligocene, bounded by topographic highs to the west in the Sierra Quebrada Honda, and to the east in the Sierra Chango Real (Zhou et al., 2016)

We also document magmatic intrusion in the mid­late Miocene that, although it does not outcrop extensively at the surface, may nonetheless have reset the detrital AFT record in the Antofagasta de la Sierra strata; we suggest caution in interpreting similar data in other arc basinsOur results imply that the southern Puna could have been dynamically connected to the regional central Andean foreland basin that initiated as early as late Eocene, highlighting the potential for the flexural behavior of the lithosphere despite inherited crustal heterogeneities, such as preexisting deep­seated faults
