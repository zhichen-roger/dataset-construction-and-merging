Abstract: U–Pb ion microprobe detrital zircon provenance investigations of pre-Mesozoic sediment samples from southern Novaya Zemlya and northern Taimyr, Arctic Russia, provide new constraints on the tectonic evolution of northern EurasiaSediments from both areas previously assigned a Neoproterozoic age are shown to be Palaeozoic (<500 Ma), changing our understanding of the timing of tectonic events and their regional correlation
Sediments from both areas previously assigned a Neoproterozoic age are shown to be Palaeozoic (<500 Ma), changing our understanding of the timing of tectonic events and their regional correlationSamples from Novaya Zemlya provide an a priori Baltica signature, and dominant cumulative probability age peaks between 610 and 530 Ma are consistent with derivation from Timanide sources
These data constrain the timing of deformation, metamorphism and development of an unconformity in southern Novaya Zemlya to a restricted period no earlier than late Cambrian–early Ordovician and at least 50 Ma after the peak Timanian eventThe unconformity on Novaya Zemlya can be correlated in style and timing with an unconformity on Severnaya Zemlya and may record post-Timanian extensional collapse and onset of spreading in the Uralian Ocean.
Furthermore, in both Novaya Zemlya and the Taimyr Peninsula, significant deformation events continued into the early Mesozoic, after the typical late Palaeozoic Uralian age (e.gKorago et al
As the geodynamic relationship between (and relative significance of) the late Palaeozoic and early Mesozoic deformation in different parts of the Russian Arctic is not yet fully understood, we use the term Uralides in its broadest sense encompassing both late Palaeozoic and early Mesozoic deformationOne approach to help clarify these uncertainties is the study of crustal affinities, which is the main focus of this study.
Most of this accretionary crust now forms the basement to the Mesozoic West Siberian Basin (Fig1) and rocks deformed during Uralian collision with a demonstrable Siberian affinity are not exposed.
In contrast, rocks deformed during Uralian collision of both Baltican and Siberian affinities are exposed north of the Arctic Circle: the margin of Ediacaran to Palaeozoic Baltica is present in the Polar Urals (Puchkov 1997), which are a direct continuation of the Urals further south, whereas the late Neoproterozoic to Palaeozoic margin of Siberia is exposed in southern and central Taimyr (e.gInger et al
Palaeozoic time; in Novaya Zemlya the main deformation is Early Mesozoic; in Taimyr both late Palaeozoic and early Mesozoic deformation is presentThe study areas are indicated by boxes.
Thus, investigations of detrital zircon populations from Neoproterozoic and early Palaeozoic sediments involved in the Uralian orogen can help determine basement affinity, especially when a unique age distribution (‘fingerprint’) can be identifiedDetrital zircon data are presented from samples collected during expeditions to southern Novaya Zemlya and Taimyr, which provide important new constraints on crustal affinities in the Eurasian Arctic
Of particular significance in this study are zircons derived from the Timanides, an accretionary orogen along the eastern and northern margin of Baltica of late Neoproterozoic age (Gee & Pease 2004, and references therein)Timanide basement is known to underlie the Timan–Pechora Basin, southern Novaya Zemlya and parts of the southeastern Barents Shelf (Fig
The Novaya Zemlya archipelago contains a predominantly westvergent fold-and-thrust belt that exposes a Precambrian to Early Triassic successionThe fold-and-thrust belt is part of the Uralian orogen but is significantly offset from its general trend (Fig
The depositional setting and fauna of the Ordovician to Permian stratigraphic record imply that the archipelago was located along the eastern margin of Baltica (present-day orientation) prior to deformation in Triassic time, with platform sediments predominant on the western side of the archipelago and slope deposits on the eastern side (e.gBondarev 1982)
Precambrian to early Palaeozoic basement is exposed at a number of localities along the length of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago (Fig2a)
In the southernmost part of the archipelago, folded, cleaved and weakly metamorphosed turbidites containing intrusive bodies of gabbro–dolerite and lamprophyre have been mapped at the base of the succession in the core of a NW–SE-trending early Mesozoic antiformal structure (Fig2b) named the Yuzhnonovozemel’sky, or Southern Novaya Zemlya, Anticlinorium in Russian literature (e.g
These strata, assigned a Neoproterozoic age on the basis of a varied assemblage of acritarchs and filamentous algae, have been described by Povysheva (1982), Smirnova et al(1982) and Kovaleva et al
(1992) recognized two deformation phases in these basement rocks, and described interference patterns in which approximately east–west-trending folds concentrated along dislocation zones are overprinted by NW–SE-trending early Mesozoic folding that affected all rocks exposed in southern Novaya Zemlya.A prominent angular unconformity terminates the basement turbidite succession and is well exposed at a number of localities in southern Novaya Zemlya (Fig

Early Ordovician sediments have been interpreted to be continental, lagoonal and coastal marine deposits reflecting a diachronous transgression onto a pre-existing fold belt (e.gBondarev 1982).
The age constraints from existing studies suggest that the time gap represented by the angular unconformity spans at least the Cambrian PeriodOn this basis, it has been assumed that the unconformity is of Timanide age (Korago et al
1992, 2004), generated in response to the orogeny that peaked during Ediacaran time (600–550 Ma) and is well documented to the SWFig
The unconformity (indicated by dotted line) is defined by NE-dipping, greenschist-facies metagreywackes of inferred Precambrian age below (in the background), in contact with vertically dipping oxidized Ordovician sandstone above, which give way to younger shelf carbonates in the foreground (person in foreground circled for scale)Location of sample VP04-020 is shown
Southern Taimyr contains a weakly to unmetamorphosed Ordovician to mid-Carboniferous shallow-marine, carbonate-dominated shelf succession that was deposited on the passive margin of Siberia (Bezzubtsev et al1983; Inger et al
Previously claimed Baltican affinities for Ordovician fossils from this succession (Cocks & Modzalevskaya 1997) have been reassessed and a Siberian affinity is now inferred (Fortey & Cocks 2003), consistent with stratigraphic and structural evidenceThe passive margin succession is overlain by a package of late Carboniferous to early Triassic shallow-marine and continental siliciclastic rocks interleaved with the Permian–Triassic extrusive and intrusive rocks of the Taimyr igneous suite (Inger et al
The passive margin succession is overlain by a package of late Carboniferous to early Triassic shallow-marine and continental siliciclastic rocks interleaved with the Permian–Triassic extrusive and intrusive rocks of the Taimyr igneous suite (Inger et al1999; Walderhaug et al
All of the Triassic and older rocks in southern Taimyr were then folded and faulted during a phase of endTriassic to earliest Jurassic dextral transpression (Inger et al1999; Torsvik & Andersen 2002; Walderhaug et al
It contains a weakly to unmetamorphosed latest Neoproterozoic (Vendian) to early Palaeozoic continental margin successionCompared with units of equivalent age in southern Taimyr, central Taimyr strata document more distal, deeperwater depositional environments

Unconformably below the continental slope succession is a varied assemblage of Precambrian crystalline unitsGreenschistfacies Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary successions predominate, including fragmented ophiolites, island-arc volcanic rocks and continental crust (Zonenshain & Natapov 1987; Zonenshain et al
Greenschistfacies Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary successions predominate, including fragmented ophiolites, island-arc volcanic rocks and continental crust (Zonenshain & Natapov 1987; Zonenshain et al1990; Uflyand et al
Associated with them are Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic amphibolite-facies metasedimentary units intruded by c900 Ma granites (Pease et al
It has been demonstrated that the Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary successions locally lie unconformably on these higher-grade complexes (Pease et al2001)
However, metamorphism and granite genesis of early Neoproterozoic (Tonian) age imply that these continental fragments within central Taimyr are unrelated to the Siberian craton (Pease et al2001).
As these metamorphic rocks are overlain by unmetamorphosed latest Neoproterozoic continental slope deposits of Siberian affinity, it can reasonably be assumed that the regional metamorphism records the endPrecambrian accretion of the allochthonous basement of central Taimyr to the Siberian margin.There is no recorded evidence of tectonic activity in central Taimyr between the late Neoproterozoic and mid-Carboniferous, suggesting that, like southern Taimyr, it was part of the stable passive margin of Siberia during this time
There is no recorded evidence of tectonic activity in central Taimyr between the late Neoproterozoic and mid-Carboniferous, suggesting that, like southern Taimyr, it was part of the stable passive margin of Siberia during this timeCentral Taimyr, however, was involved in the Carboniferous–Permian Uralian orogeny during which compressional tectonism was accompanied by the intrusion of syn- and post-tectonic granitoids (Vernikovsky et al
Central Taimyr, however, was involved in the Carboniferous–Permian Uralian orogeny during which compressional tectonism was accompanied by the intrusion of syn- and post-tectonic granitoids (Vernikovsky et al1995; Pease 2001)
Central Taimyr was also subjected to Early Mesozoic transpression, but the absence of Mesozoic strata in this part of Taimyr makes this deformation phase difficult to isolate from earlier deformation events.Northern Taimyr (Fig
Despite deformation and regional greenschist- to amphibolite-facies metamorphism associated with the late Palaeozoic Uralian orogeny, acritarchs and anabarites have been interpreted to suggest a late Neoproterozoic (Vendian)–Cambrian age (Bezzubtsev et al1986)
Local migmatization as a result of later Uralian synto post-tectonic Carboniferous–Permian granitoid plutonism complicates the structure of northern Taimyr sedimentary deposits (Vernikovsky et al1995; Pease 2001)
Hence, the Carboniferous–Permian granitic magmatism is interpreted as ‘stitching’ plutonism that reflects the collision of northern Taimyr with southern–central Taimyr (Zonenshain & Natapov 1987; Zonenshain et al1990; Uflyand et al
Deformed and weakly metamorphosed strata below the unconformity are mapped as Neoproterozoic (e.gKorago et al
2004), but the detrital zircon ages show that at least some of the succession is Cambrian or younger (<530 Ma)The existence of exposed Neoproterozoic sediments in southern Novaya Zemlya must now be open to doubt.
The existence of exposed Neoproterozoic sediments in southern Novaya Zemlya must now be open to doubt.The maximum age of strata overlying the unconformity is late Cambrian–early Ordovician (<490 Ma), in good agreement with palaeontological data that indicate a Tremadoc age (Bondarev 1982).
The maximum age of strata overlying the unconformity is late Cambrian–early Ordovician (<490 Ma), in good agreement with palaeontological data that indicate a Tremadoc age (Bondarev 1982).The angular unconformity between early Ordovician and older rocks in southern Novaya Zemlya has previously been attributed to the Timanide orogeny (Korago et al
The angular unconformity between early Ordovician and older rocks in southern Novaya Zemlya has previously been attributed to the Timanide orogeny (Korago et al1992, 2004), which peaked during Ediacaran (mid–late Vendian) time (610– 530 Ma) (Gee & Pease 2004, and references therein)

However, the detrital zircon data indicate that the unconformity is of midto late Cambrian ageThe potential cause of this unconformity is discussed below.
All three samples are supposed to be Neoproterozoic in age (Bezzubtsev et al1983, 1986)
Detrital zircon ages, however, consistently indicate a maximum age of less than 450–500 Ma, suggesting that this unit is actually Cambrian–Ordovician, or younger.Given the pre-Caledonian age of the southern Novaya Zemlya samples and their proximity to the Timan–Pechora region and the Baltic Shield, it was assumed that they would provide unequivocal reference data for Baltica and the Timanide orogen
The detrital zircon results corroborate this assumption, with Timanide ‘fingerprints’ present in all samples and evidence for partial input to early Ordovician sediment from the Baltic ShieldHowever, the detrital zircon data have significantly changed our understanding of the angular unconformity that separates early Ordovician clastic strata from older rocks in southern Novaya Zemlya.
However, the detrital zircon data have significantly changed our understanding of the angular unconformity that separates early Ordovician clastic strata from older rocks in southern Novaya Zemlya.The lithological associations, petrography and heavy mineral assemblages (Scott, unpubl
The previous dating of these strata as Neoproterozoic led to the conclusion that the deformation and weak metamorphism that they exhibit, and the unconformity that terminates the succession, were the consequence of Ediacaran Timanide orogeny (Korago et al1992, 2004; Bogolepova & Gee 2004; Roberts & Olovyanishnikov 2004)
It is now clear, however, that the deformation, metamorphism and development of the unconformity are no older than mid-Cambrian (i.eat least 50 Ma after the peak Timanide event), requiring a reassessment of their significance.
The late Neoproterozoic Timanide orogeny was the product of accretionary collision with the eastern and northern margin of Baltica, with the onset of convergence linked to a subduction polarity reversal in the adjacent ocean (e.gScarrow et al
The logical conclusion of this argument is that ‘Timanide’ accretion to the margin of Baltica continued until mid- to late Cambrian timeIn support of this argument, a significant proportion of the detrital zircons found in the post-unconformity early Ordovician strata of southern Novaya Zemlya yield the same age as the time span represented by the unconformity, suggesting that it represents a significant tectonomagmatic event

In offshore areas of the Eurasian Arctic such as the eastern Barents Shelf and the northern Kara Sea Shelf, the nature and affinities of late Precambrian and early Palaeozoic basement are unknownConsequently, there is still much to understand about late Precambrian and early Palaeozoic tectonic evolution and regional palaeogeographical relationships in the Eurasian Arctic
Consequently, there is still much to understand about late Precambrian and early Palaeozoic tectonic evolution and regional palaeogeographical relationships in the Eurasian ArcticThis investigation provides a robust link between northern Taimyr, Severnaya Zemlya and Novaya Zemlya that can be tied to the Timanian margin of Baltica.
Comparison of detrital zircon spectra from Taimyr and southern Novaya Zemlya reveals a striking similarity between the late Neoproterozoic–Cambrian continental slope deposits of northern Taimyr and the turbidites below the unconformity in southern Novaya ZemlyaThe cumulative frequency peaks of 550– 565 Ma that dominate the northern Taimyr samples are consistent with Timanide ages: Granitoids with crystallization ages of 560– 565 Ma (Gee et al
(2007) described a pronounced angular unconformity from October Revolution Island, for which isotopic ages obtained from igneous rocks below and above the unconformity surface tightly constrain its age to the vicinity of the Cambrian–Ordovician boundary, in good agreement with Tremadoc fauna obtained from associated sedimentsRocks beneath the unconformity are strongly folded, implying that a short-lived phase of deformation was responsible for generating the hiatus
These similarities imply that the North Kara block (of which northern Taimyr and Severnaya Zemlya are a part) was a continuation of Baltica in the Cambrian–Ordovician, rather than an independent microplate (see Metelkin et al2005).
Changing tectonic regimes around the Cambrian– Ordovician boundaryThe presence of a late Cambrian unconformity in southern Novaya Zemlya truncating older metasediments that have been demonstrably deformed in the Cambrian provides new insights into the Timanide orogen, suggesting that accretion to the margin of Baltica may have continued throughout the Cambrian Period
The presence of a late Cambrian unconformity in southern Novaya Zemlya truncating older metasediments that have been demonstrably deformed in the Cambrian provides new insights into the Timanide orogen, suggesting that accretion to the margin of Baltica may have continued throughout the Cambrian PeriodIt also provides a potential explanation for the coeval Cambrian– Ordovician boundary unconformity on Severnaya Zemlya
It also provides a potential explanation for the coeval Cambrian– Ordovician boundary unconformity on Severnaya ZemlyaLorenz et al
(2007, 2008) referred to the Severnaya Zemlya unconformity as an ‘early Caledonian’ feature and suggested that it reflects far-field stresses coincident with the late Cambrian to early Ordovician (c500–480 Ma) Finnmarkian deformation previously described in the northern Scandinavian Caledonides (Sturt et al
Observations in southern Novaya Zemlya provide an alternative explanation for the unconformity in Severnaya Zemlya: Cambrian deformation and magmatism are related to a late Timanian accretionary event on the opposing margin of Baltica to the CaledonidesGiven the lack of knowledge regarding basement beneath the Barents Shelf, it is possible that the effects of late Timanian deformation could be widespread throughout this region
The late Cambrian to early Ordovician event is also linked with the continental break-up that generated the Uralian OceanIt is well established that the Uralian passive margin of Baltica to the south of Novaya Zemlya developed as a consequence of late Cambrian to early Ordovician rifting (e.g
It is well established that the Uralian passive margin of Baltica to the south of Novaya Zemlya developed as a consequence of late Cambrian to early Ordovician rifting (e.gPuchkov 2002, and references therein), which progressed to sea-floor spreading and development of the Uralian Ocean
This late Cambrian to early Ordovician rift– drift transition is penecontemporaneous with the age of the unconformity in southern Novaya Zemlya and Severnaya ZemlyaConsequently, it can be argued that the final Cambrian accretionary event on the Baltica margin recorded in southern Novaya Zemlya was intimately related to the end of the ‘Timanide’ compressional regime, and the subsequent onset of orogenic collapse and continental break-up around the Cambrian–Ordovician boundary was regionally significant
Consequently, it can be argued that the final Cambrian accretionary event on the Baltica margin recorded in southern Novaya Zemlya was intimately related to the end of the ‘Timanide’ compressional regime, and the subsequent onset of orogenic collapse and continental break-up around the Cambrian–Ordovician boundary was regionally significantAspects of the post-unconformity geology of southern Novaya Zemlya are consistent with this hypothesis, as follows.
Early Ordovician strata above the unconformity in southern Novaya Zemlya accumulated in coastal environments and show significant thickness variationsA late Cambrian to early Ordovician extensional event is the most likely explanation of the differential subsidence, creating the accommodation space for the early Ordovician and subsequent Palaeozoic successions to be deposited and preserved
A late Cambrian to early Ordovician extensional event is the most likely explanation of the differential subsidence, creating the accommodation space for the early Ordovician and subsequent Palaeozoic successions to be deposited and preservedThis is also consistent with late Cambrian to early Ordovician continental break-up.
This is also consistent with late Cambrian to early Ordovician continental break-up.The older zircons in the post-unconformity early Ordovician sediments indicate derivation from the Baltic Shield, suggesting that clastic detritus crossed Timan–Pechora and adjacent shelf areas to reach the coastal environments preserved in southern Novaya Zemlya
The older zircons in the post-unconformity early Ordovician sediments indicate derivation from the Baltic Shield, suggesting that clastic detritus crossed Timan–Pechora and adjacent shelf areas to reach the coastal environments preserved in southern Novaya ZemlyaThis is taken as circumstantial evidence that the late Cambrian to early Ordovician extensional event, and associated onset of early Ordovician sedimentation, may have been linked with collapse of the Timanide orogen and is consistent with the later deposition of Ordovician shallowmarine deposits across the Timan–Pechora region (e.g

Taimyr is characterized by Late Triassic dextral transpression (Inger et al1999), implying that Severnaya Zemlya and eastern parts of Taimyr may have been translated to some degree
Although further study of these early Palaeozoic relationships is required, a picture of complex Neoproterozoic to early Palaeozoic accretionary and rifting events around the margins of Baltica is emerging that raises important questions regarding the nature, extent and timing of amalgamation of basement elements beneath the RussianDeformed and weakly metamorphosed turbidites derived from a juvenile arc-related source are unconformably overlain by an unmetamorphosed Ordovician clastic–carbonate succession in southern Novaya Zemlya

Detrital zircon ages demonstrate that the turbidites beneath the unconformity are Cambrian, not Neoproterozoic as has previously been suggested, and that the age of the unconformity is Late Cambrian to Early OrdovicianStrata above and below the unconformity preserve a unique Timanide ‘fingerprint’ and thus confirm a Baltica provenance.
The deposition of early Ordovician strata unconformably upon folded and metamorphosed Cambrian strata in southern Novaya Zemlya brackets a relatively short interval for deformation and exhumationA comparable unconformity has been reported from the Severnaya Zemlya archipelago NE of Taimyr
Severnaya Zemlya is also part of the Kara block and the similarity of the late Cambrian to early Ordovician unconformity further strengthens the argument that the Kara block was part of Baltica.The late Cambrian to early Ordovician unconformity appears to have regional significance
The late Cambrian to early Ordovician unconformity appears to have regional significanceIt is interpreted to reflect the cessation of Timanian convergence and ultimate collapse of the orogen, which affected a greater area than previously recognized
Deformation related to Timanian convergence probably continued into late Cambrian time, extending duration of orogeny by about 50 Ma, and was followed by a transition to an extensional regime as the Uralian Ocean began to open in the Ordovician.Without the logistical and financial assistance of the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat, fieldwork in Taimyr would not have been possible
