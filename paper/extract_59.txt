Abstract— The Precambrian rocks of northern Botswana comprise poorly exposed igneous complexes, high-grade metamorphic rocks, as well as sedimentary sequences including mainly siliciclastic and carbonate rocksNew U—Pb SHRIMP data are presented for detrital zircons from siliciclastic rocks collected from the Shakawe area in northern Botswana

In contrast, Precambrian rocks are poorly exposed within the Kalahari Desert and therefore the age of crustal terranes in northwest Botswana is still poorly documentedClastic sedimentary rocks and related detrital zircons can provide powerful information on source regions (e.g

Assuming that these ages represent the whole spectrum of zircon-bearing lithologies in the provenance area of the sediments, these data indicate the presence of Palaeoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoicbasement complexes in that regionThe basement complex exposed in northern Botswana is known to include rocks with U—Pb zircon ages fitting into these two groups and this provides support for the contention that the sediments were sourced locally

Therefore, our data support the correlation between the adjacent Neoproterozoic Ghanzi—Chobe and Katangan basins (Kampunzu and Cailteux, 1999), and provide a good basis for a regional correlation of NeoproterozoicThis study on detrital zircon grains of an arkosic sandstone from the Shakawe zone shows that: (1) the maximum age of deposition of the sediments studied is c

These results are consistent with a local origin for the sediments because the pre-Neoproterozoic basement exposed in northern Botswana includes Palaeoproterozoic and late Mesoproterozoic rock assemblagesThe absence of both early Kibaran (1.4 — 1.25 Ga) and Archaean detrital zircons is
