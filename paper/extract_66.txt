Here we report two occurrences of baddeleyite in a siltstone from the Triassic Smith Bank Formation of the Central North Sea, which we believe to be the first record of this mineral as a detrital phase within a clastic sedimentary rock.Baddeleyite (monoclinic ZrO2) was first described by Fletcher (1893) and named after Joseph Baddeley, a tea tycoon, who discovered it in 1892 near the small town of Rakwana on Sri Lanka

Baddeleyite was found in siltstones of the Smith Bank Formation which is Early Triassic in ageThe Smith Bank Formation consists of fine-grained, and virtually biostratigraphically barren, mudstones that have been previously described as monotonous (Deegan & Scull 1977; Lervik et al

It is overlain by the Mid- to Late Triassic Skagerrak Formation, which comprises three sandstone members (Judy, Joanne and Josephine) intercalated with three mudstone members (Julius, Jonathan and Joshua).During the Permian, the area that was later to become the Central North Sea formed a gently undulating, featureless, frequently evaporitic, basin (Fig

At the onset of the Early Triassic, continental clastic sedimentation coincided with an increase in precipitation and the area became part of a southeasterly-flowing ephemeral fluvial system in which sediment was believed to be sourced from Fennoscandia,Fig

In the Central North Sea Triassic, where there is a lack of regionally-recognizable seismic markers to facilitate lithostratigraphic correlation, further investigation of the heavy mineralogy of siltstones may reveal data of lithostratigraphic significanceFurther work is continuing with this end in mind.

Detrital baddeleyite has been identified within an early Triassic siltstone of the Central North Sea using backscatter electron imaging and energy-dispersive x-ray analysisThis is believed to be its first recorded instance within a clastic sedimentary rock.
