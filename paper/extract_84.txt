(In this paper, all explicit precisions are cited at the 2σ, or ~95 percent confi dence, level.) Some samples that are more fi negrained or contain components of Plio-Pleistocene age yield single-crystal dates of much poorer precisionOne solution to this problem is to analyze multigrain aliquots, rather than single grains
Key words: explicit precisions, percent confi dence, Plio-Pleistocene, age yield single-crystal dates, poorer precisionOne solution, analyze multigrain aliquots

Analyses from several samples of the Triassic part of the Torlesse Supergroup of New Zealand (Adams and Kelley 1998) reveal a decidedly multimodal SPDFThe two groups of apparent ages comprise ranges from ~150–300 Ma and from ~400–500 Ma, suggesting two different source regions

Among the 40Ar/39Ar community, this approach was pioneered by Kelley and Bluck (1989; 1992) in their studies of detrital micas from the Ordovician Southern Uplands sequence of ScotlandSubsequent research demonstrated the applicability of the technique to understanding sedimentary transport in a variety of continental settings (e.g., Renne et al

Copeland and Harrison (1990) used 40Ar/39Ar data from Ocean Drilling Program sediment cores in the distal Bengal Fan to demonstrate that rocks metamorphosed during the Himalayan orogeny had been uplifted to the surface and were providing detritus to the fan by Middle Miocene timeMore detailed investigations of the timing of Himalayan rock uplift have involved dating detrital K-feldspar and micas from more proximal foreland deposits (Harrison et al

The curves are markedly different on either side of the transition: almost all grains from tributaries to the north give Miocene or younger apparent ages, while grains from tributaries to the south give Paleozoic or Proterozoic apparent agesThe detrital thermochronologic data suggest that the physiographic transition marks the position of a recently active, south-vergent thrust fault that accommodates uplift of the high Himalayan ranges relative to their foothills
