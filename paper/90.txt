The Northern Sierra terrane is one of a series of Paleozoic terranes outboard of the western Laurentian margin that contain lithotectonic elements generally considered to have originated in settings far removed from their present relative locationsThe Lower to Middle Paleozoic Shoo Fly Complex makes up the oldest rocks in the terrane and consists partly of thrust-imbricated deep-marine sedimentary strata having detrital zircon age signatures consistent with derivation from the northwestern Laurentian margin
The Lower to Middle Paleozoic Shoo Fly Complex makes up the oldest rocks in the terrane and consists partly of thrust-imbricated deep-marine sedimentary strata having detrital zircon age signatures consistent with derivation from the northwestern Laurentian marginThe thrust package is structurally overlain by the Sierra City mélange, which formed within a mid-Paleozoic subduction zone and contains tectonic blocks of Ediacaran tonalite and sandstone with Proterozoic to early Paleozoic detrital zircon populations having age spectra pointing to a non–western Laurentian source

Island-arc volcanic rocks of the Upper Devonian Sierra Buttes Formation unconformably overlie the Shoo Fly Complex and are spatially associated with the Bowman Lake batholith, Wolf Creek granite stock, and smaller hypabyssal felsic bodies that intrude the Shoo Fly ComplexHere, we report new results from U-Pb sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe–reverse geometry (SHRIMP-RG) dating of 15 samples of the volcanic and intrusive rocks, along with geochemical studies of the dated units
In addition, we report U-Pb laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry ages for 50 detrital zircons from a feldspathic sandstone block in the Sierra City mélange, which yielded abundant Ordovician to Early Devonian (ca480–390 Ma) ages
These data provide a younger age limit for assembly of the Shoo Fly Complex and indicate that arc magmatism in the Northern Sierra terrane began with a major pulse of Late Devonian (Famennian) igneous activityThe Wolf Creek stock yielded an age of 352 ± 3 Ma, showing that the felsic magmatism extended into the early Mississippian
The Wolf Creek stock yielded an age of 352 ± 3 Ma, showing that the felsic magmatism extended into the early MississippianAll of these rocks have similar geochemical features with arctype trace-element signatures, consistent with the interpretation that they constitute a petrogenetically linked volcano-plutonic system
Field evidence shows that the felsic hypabyssal intrusions in the Sierra City mélange were intruded while parts of it were still unlithified, indicating that a relatively narrow time span separated subduction-related deformation in the Shoo Fly Complex and onset of Late Devonian arc magmatismFollowing recent models for Paleozoic terrane assembly in the western Cordillera, we infer that the Shoo Fly Complex together with strata in the Roberts Mountains allochthon in Nevada migrated south along a sinistral transform boundary prior to the onset of arc magmatism in the Northern Sierra terrane
Following recent models for Paleozoic terrane assembly in the western Cordillera, we infer that the Shoo Fly Complex together with strata in the Roberts Mountains allochthon in Nevada migrated south along a sinistral transform boundary prior to the onset of arc magmatism in the Northern Sierra terraneWe suggest that the Shoo Fly Complex arrived close to the western Laurentian margin at the same time as the Roberts Mountains allochthon was thrust over the passive margin during the Late Devonian–early Mississippian Antler orogeny
We suggest that the Shoo Fly Complex arrived close to the western Laurentian margin at the same time as the Roberts Mountains allochthon was thrust over the passive margin during the Late Devonian–early Mississippian Antler orogenyThis led to a change in plate kinematics that caused development of a west-facing Late Devonian island arc on the Shoo Fly Complex
This led to a change in plate kinematics that caused development of a west-facing Late Devonian island arc on the Shoo Fly ComplexDue to slab rollback, the arc front migrated onto parts of the Sierra City mélange that had only recently been incorporated into the accretionary complex
In the mélange, blocks of Ediacaran tonalite, as well as sandstones having detrital zircon populations with non–western Laurentian sources, may have been derived from the Yreka and Trinity terranes in the eastern Klamath Mountains, where similar rock types occurIf so, this suggests that these Klamath terranes were in close proximity to the developing accretionary complex in the Northern Sierra terrane in the Late Devonian.
If so, this suggests that these Klamath terranes were in close proximity to the developing accretionary complex in the Northern Sierra terrane in the Late Devonian.Passive-margin sedimentation persisted along the western Laurentian margin beginning with late Neoproterozoic rifting until the onset of plate convergence as recorded by the initiation of arc magmatism and crustal shortening in the region in Middle to Late Devonian time (Rubin et al., 1990; Colpron and Nelson, 2009, 2011)
Passive-margin sedimentation persisted along the western Laurentian margin beginning with late Neoproterozoic rifting until the onset of plate convergence as recorded by the initiation of arc magmatism and crustal shortening in the region in Middle to Late Devonian time (Rubin et al., 1990; Colpron and Nelson, 2009, 2011)This change in tectonic regime represents the first of a series of orogenic events to affect the evolving continental margin during the formation of the North American Cordillera
Several tectonic terranes occur outboard of the Paleozoic passive margin (Fig1), some of which show stratigraphic and faunal linkages with western Laurentia (peri-Laurentian realm in the terminology of Nelson et al., 2013) and are inferred to have initially formed on Laurentian crust in the middle Paleozoic (e.g., Yukon-Tanana, Stikinia, and Quesnellia in Fig
1), some of which show stratigraphic and faunal linkages with western Laurentia (peri-Laurentian realm in the terminology of Nelson et al., 2013) and are inferred to have initially formed on Laurentian crust in the middle Paleozoic (e.g., Yukon-Tanana, Stikinia, and Quesnellia in Fig1)
The southernmost terrane of the Cordillera that is inferred to contain rocks that originated in the Arctic–NE Pacific realm is the Northern Sierra terrane, which is separated from strata of the Paleozoic passive margin in Nevada by deep-marine Paleozoic strata of the Roberts Mountains and Golconda allochthons (Fig1)
Upper Devonian–lower Mississippian volcanic rocks unconformably overlie the ShooFly Complex, and, along with associated intrusive rocks, they record a distinct pulse of mid-Paleozoic island-arc magmatism that many workers have linked to the broadly coeval Antler orogeny along the Paleozoic passive margin to the east

We also present additional data from detrital zircons in part of the Sierra City mélange lying a short distance stratigraphically beneath the unconformity with overlying Upper Devonian arc strataThe new data allow timing relations between final stages in the assembly of the Shoo Fly Complex and the onset of Paleozoic arc magmatism in the Northern Sierra terrane to be addressed in detail, which sheds new light on the Paleozoic plate-tectonic evolution of the terrane and its relations to other, broadly coeval parts of the collage of tectonic terranes within the western Cordillera.

Arc magmatism continued in the peri-Laurentian terranes after they became detached from the continental margin when the Slide Mountain marginal ocean began opening in Late Devonian–early Mississippian  time; remnants of this ancient ocean are preserved in the Slide Mountain terrane (Piercey et al., 2012)Ordovician to Silurian arc magmatism preceded establishment of the Devonian arc in what is now the southern part of the Yukon-Tanana terrane in southeastern Alaska, which was originally located either outboard of the northern part of the terrane or along strike farther to the north, where it may have connected with coeval arc rocks developing in the Arctic realm (Pecha et al., 2016).
Ordovician to Silurian arc magmatism preceded establishment of the Devonian arc in what is now the southern part of the Yukon-Tanana terrane in southeastern Alaska, which was originally located either outboard of the northern part of the terrane or along strike farther to the north, where it may have connected with coeval arc rocks developing in the Arctic realm (Pecha et al., 2016).Wright and Wyld (2006) proposed that some of the exotic terranes within what is now termed the Arctic–NE Pacific realm by Nelson et al
1), initially began to evolve in Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic time in settings adjacent to the northern or western margins of Gondwana (all directions used herein are in present coordinates) after breakup of the ancient Rodinia supercontinentSubsequently, the terranes were tectonically transported along the eastern and southern margins of Laurentia by slab rollback in front of a rapidly moving Scotia-type arc system (e.g., Schellart et al., 2007) prior to their Paleozoic or Mesozoic accretion to the western Laurentian margin
Subsequently, the terranes were tectonically transported along the eastern and southern margins of Laurentia by slab rollback in front of a rapidly moving Scotia-type arc system (e.g., Schellart et al., 2007) prior to their Paleozoic or Mesozoic accretion to the western Laurentian marginAs evidence for such a model, Wright and Wyld (2006) cited the presence of Ediacaran to Early Devonian island-arc assemblages in the Alexander, Yreka, and Trinity terranes, as well as ophiolitic assemblages in the latter two terranes, making their early history markedly unlike almost all the terranes known to have originated on or near the western Laurentian margin
As evidence for such a model, Wright and Wyld (2006) cited the presence of Ediacaran to Early Devonian island-arc assemblages in the Alexander, Yreka, and Trinity terranes, as well as ophiolitic assemblages in the latter two terranes, making their early history markedly unlike almost all the terranes known to have originated on or near the western Laurentian marginAdditionally, parts of all three terranes have yielded detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra that include significant numbers of zircon grains with ages of 1.55–1.45 Ga and 0.65–0.55 Ga that do not match known age distributions in Precambrian crustal units in western Laurentia (Wright and Wyld, 2006, and references therein).
Additionally, parts of all three terranes have yielded detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra that include significant numbers of zircon grains with ages of 1.55–1.45 Ga and 0.65–0.55 Ga that do not match known age distributions in Precambrian crustal units in western Laurentia (Wright and Wyld, 2006, and references therein).Following publication of this innovative model, increasing evidence has instead been advanced to support derivation of these and similar terranes from settings near Baltica, Siberia, and the Caledonide belt
The Alexander terrane had reached the northwestern corner of Laurentia by Late Devonian–Mississippian time, but the terrane then began a long period of residence, along with Wrangellia, in the ancestral northeast Pacific until Mesozoic accretion against the western Laurentian margin (Colpron and Nelson, 2009, 2011; Nelson et al., 2013)In contrast, after the Yreka, Trinity, and Okanagan terranes and the Sierra City mélange had reached the northwestern corner of Laurentia, they were transported southward along a sinistral transform boundary parallel to the western Laurentian margin
Ordovician–Middle Devonian volcanic arc rocks in the Turtleback and Yellow Aster complexes at the base of the Chilliwack terrane in northern Washington State (Fig1; Brown et al., 2010; Schermer et al., 2018) are also inferred to have originated near northern or northeastern Laurentia, but they were emplaced in their present position relative to the western Laurentian margin during Mesozoic strike-slip faulting (Monger et al., 2006; Yokelson et al., 2015; Schermer et al., 2018).

Tectonic interactions between some of the southward-migrating terranes and the western continental margin account for compressional or transpressional deformation documented in places along the margin beginning in Middle Devonian time (e.g., Colpron and Nelson, 2009; Beranek et al., 2016), and farther south in Nevada, this included emplacement of the Roberts Mountains allochthon over the passive margin during the Late Devonian–early Mississippian Antler orogeny (e.g., Dickinson, 2000, 2006)Southward migration of the terranes provided the sources for west-derived clastic sediments with non–western Laurentian detrital zircon signatures that were deposited onto the passive margin beginning in Late Devonian time (Gehrels and Pecha, 2014; Beranek et al., 2016)
Southward migration of the terranes provided the sources for west-derived clastic sediments with non–western Laurentian detrital zircon signatures that were deposited onto the passive margin beginning in Late Devonian time (Gehrels and Pecha, 2014; Beranek et al., 2016)Colpron and Nelson (2009) suggested that onset of Devonian continental arc magmatism along the western Laurentian margin was driven by east-directed subduction that nucleated along the zone of weakness created by the transform plate boundary
Colpron and Nelson (2009) suggested that onset of Devonian continental arc magmatism along the western Laurentian margin was driven by east-directed subduction that nucleated along the zone of weakness created by the transform plate boundaryThe same authors inferred that the Upper Devonian–Lower Mississippian arc in the Northern Sierra terrane, which is the main subject of this paper, was constructed upon the Shoo Fly Complex after that unit had arrived near the margin farther south
The same authors inferred that the Upper Devonian–Lower Mississippian arc in the Northern Sierra terrane, which is the main subject of this paper, was constructed upon the Shoo Fly Complex after that unit had arrived near the margin farther southPermian arc rocks and associated strata in the Alexander, Yukon-Tanana, Stikinia, Quesnellia, Chilliwack, and Northern Sierra terranes contain the distinctive McCloud fauna
Permian arc rocks and associated strata in the Alexander, Yukon-Tanana, Stikinia, Quesnellia, Chilliwack, and Northern Sierra terranes contain the distinctive McCloud fauna(Miller, 1987)
The same fauna also occurs in Permian strata in the eastern Klamath Mountains, which make up part of a succession of Lower Devonian and younger, partly arc-related strata (Redding section) that largely postdate formation of the Yreka and Trinity terranes (Dickinson, 2000; Lindsley-Griffin et al., 2008)The McCloud fauna is considered to have evolved on the order of 2000–3000 km away from the Laurentian margin and generally at more southerly latitudes than the present positions of the terranes containing the fauna (Belasky et al., 2002; Stevens and Belasky, 2009)
This evidence indicates that in late Paleozoic times, all these terranes formed a festoon of island arcs outboard of the Slide Mountain ocean, which, after its Late Devonian–early Mississippian initiation, progressively widened by slab rollback as the arcs migrated seaward (Colpron and Nelson, 2009; Piercey et al., 2012)Parts of this ocean extended as far south as the Havallah basin in Nevada, in which Upper Devonian–Permian deep-marine strata accumulated prior to eastward thrusting over the continental margin to form the Golconda allochthon during the Late Permian–Early Triassic Sonoma orogeny (Miller et al., 1984, 1992; Dickinson, 2000, 2006)

2) show varying degrees of deformation and regional low-grade metamorphism as a result of Middle Jurassic to Cretaceous orogenesis, as well as contact metamorphism associated with emplacement of Jurassic and Cretaceous plutonic rocks (e.g., Hanson et al., 1996; Schweickert, 2015)Original rock types are readily recognizable, however, and we omit the prefix “meta-” for the sake of simplicity
The oldest and laterally most extensive unit in the Northern Sierra terrane is the Lower to Middle Paleozoic Shoo Fly Complex, which extends for a considerable distance to the southeast along strike from the area shown in Figure 2 (Schweickert, 2015) and forms the basement to four separate, mostly arc-related sequences that are typically separated by unconformities and range in age from Late Devonian to Early Cretaceous (Harwood, 1992; Schweickert, 2015)The oldest arc rocks occur primarily within the Upper Devonian to Middle Pennsylvanian Taylorsville sequence and in the partly correlative Lake Tahoe sequence in the southeast part of the area shown in Figure 2 (Harwood, 1992)
The oldest arc rocks occur primarily within the Upper Devonian to Middle Pennsylvanian Taylorsville sequence and in the partly correlative Lake Tahoe sequence in the southeast part of the area shown in Figure 2 (Harwood, 1992)Permian island-arc tholeiitic and calc-alkaline basaltic to andesitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks containing McCloud faunal elements rest unconformably on the Taylorsville sequence (Brooks and Coles, 1980; Rouer et al., 1988; Harwood, 1992)
Permian island-arc tholeiitic and calc-alkaline basaltic to andesitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks containing McCloud faunal elements rest unconformably on the Taylorsville sequence (Brooks and Coles, 1980; Rouer et al., 1988; Harwood, 1992)The Permian arc rocks are unconformably overlain by Upper Triassic to Cretaceous volcanic and sedimentary strata that are stratigraphically linked to continental-margin volcanic arc rocks resting on Laurentian basement farther east and south, thus tying the Northern Sierra terrane to North America by the Late Triassic.
The Permian arc rocks are unconformably overlain by Upper Triassic to Cretaceous volcanic and sedimentary strata that are stratigraphically linked to continental-margin volcanic arc rocks resting on Laurentian basement farther east and south, thus tying the Northern Sierra terrane to North America by the Late Triassic.The Shoo Fly Complex and overlying Upper Devonian to Jurassic arc strata in the southern part of the area shown in Figure 2 have been tilted uniformly to the east

In any case, because of this tilting, the map pattern in the southern part of Figure 2 essentially represents a cross-sectional view of Paleozoic to Middle Jurassic strata exposed between the Feather River ultramafic belt and Mesozoic plutons to the eastNext, we describe the Shoo Fly Complex and the Taylorsville sequence and associated intrusive rocks in more detail, as they are the main focus of this paper.
3; see Supplemental Item 31 for detailed ArcGIS files for the digital map), the Shoo Fly Complex consists of four large, west-vergent thrust sheets, and it is in structural contact with the Feather River ultramafic belt, a polyphase suture zone separating the Northern Sierra terrane from Paleozoic and Mesozoic oceanic and island-arc terranes to the west (e.g., Saleeby et al., 1989; Schweickert, 2015)The Lang sequence and the Duncan
Peak and Culbertson Lake allochthons consist dominantly of Ordovician to pre–Upper Devonian deep-marine siliciclastic and hemipelagic deposits deformed by west-verging tight to isoclinal folds (Schweickert et al., 1984; Girty et al., 1990, 1996; Harwood, 1992)
Upper Devonian deep-marine siliciclastic and hemipelagic deposits deformed by west-verging tight to isoclinal folds (Schweickert et al., 1984; Girty et al., 1990, 1996; Harwood, 1992)These largely coherent units are structurally overlain by the Sierra City mélange, which is inferred to have formed in an active subduction complex and contains blocks of a variety of rock types set within a matrix of sheared mudstone, sandstone, or serpentinite (Schweickert et al., 1984; Girty and Pardini, 1987; Mount and Schweickert, 1986; Mount, 1990)
Sandstone blocks in the Sierra City mélange, in contrast, have yielded detrital zircon populations that include abundant Neoproterozoic and Silurian to Early Devonian grains, along with grains showing a wide range of older Proterozoic ages that do not match age distributions expected for western or northwestern Laurentia (Girty and Wardlaw, 1984; Harding et al., 2000)Using the laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) technique, Grove et al
(2008) yielded abundant Neoproterozoic agesThese data led Colpron and Nelson (2009) to include the Sierra City mélange as one of the terranes originally derived from the vicinity of Siberia, Baltica, and the northeast Caledonide belt
Grizzly Formation, which contains Frasnian and Famennian fossils and overlies the Shoo Fly Complex along a pronounced angular unconformity (Schweickert and Girty, 1981; Hanson and Schweickert, 1986)Terrigenous clastic rocks in the Grizzly Formation were derived primarily from erosion of Shoo Fly rocks, and Girty et al
The unit includes andesitic and felsic subaqueous ash-fall tuff, felsic lava, volcaniclastic turbidites, and coarser subaqueous mass-flow deposits (some of which are rich in pumice) intercalated with black siliceous mudstone and radiolarian chert that contain mid-Famennian ammonoids and conodonts (Anderson et al., 1974; Hannah and Moores, 1986; Hanson and Schweickert, 1986; Brooks, 2000; Silva et al., 2000)Hypabyssal intrusions primarily ranging in composition from basaltic andesite to rhyolite are common and show abundant evidence of interaction with wet, unconsolidated sediments beneath the seafloor, including the common presence of intrusive pillows or zones of peperite (e.g., Hanson and Schweickert, 1982, 1986; Hanson, 1991)
The latter unit is characterized by basaltic, latitic, and rhyolitic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks belonging to the shoshonitic series (Rouer et al., 1989), which record the last stage of arc magmatism in the Taylorsville sequence and contain early Mississippian (Kinderhookian) fossils (Harwood, 1992)These rocks are overlain by a distinctive unit, the upper Peale Formation, which consists mostly of rhythmically bedded radiolarian chert that can be traced throughout the part of the Northern Sierra terrane shown in Figure 2
Fossil radiolaria indicate slow sedimentation over a long time interval from the late early Mississippian to atleast the middle Pennsylvanian, although the younger age range for the unit is uncertain because it is overlain disconformably by Permian (late Wolfcampian) island-arc strata (Harwood, 1992).

Biotite-hornblende granodiorite makes up much of the middle portion of the batholith, and biotite granite crops out in three separate areas, although the two northern areas are likely to be continuous beneath Cenozoic cover.Numerous dacitic to rhyolitic hypabyssal intrusions penetrate the batholith, the Shoo Fly Complex, and the Grizzly Formation to the east (Fig
Previous geochronological studies of Late Devonian magmatism in theNorthern Sierra terrane relied primarily upon the thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) method applied to multigrain zircon fractions
(2012) obtained an age of 372 ± 6 Ma for zircon from granite within the batholith using the LA-ICP-MS technique, as part of a study on Mesozoic granitoid plutonism in the northern Sierras.To develop better geochronological constraints on the timing of middle
Paleozoic arc magmatism in the Northern Sierra terrane, 10 samples were collected along three transects through the Bowman Lake batholith (Fig3; Table 1), along with one sample from the Wolf Creek stock from the same location sampled by Saleeby et al
In order to better document the nature of Late Devonian magmatism in the Northern Sierra terrane, we present new geochemical results for most of the samples collected for geochronologyLow-grade metamorphism in the Bowman Lake batholith and Wolf Creek stock is recorded by partial to complete replacement of biotite and hornblende by chlorite, actinolite, titanite, and epidote-group minerals
Ages for geological interpretations were calculated using the 206Pb/238U isotopic ratio; 207Pb/206Pb ratios were not used due to the absence of old (Precambrian) grainsDiscordance was calculated between 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U ages

Kernel density estimates plotted with bandwidth = 13 Ma, for example, result in recognition of a sole Phanerozoic peak at 420 MaUsing the “unmix ages” routine in Isoplot (plug-in for MS-Excel; Ludwig, 2003) on only the portion of grains that are Phanerozoic in age, we calculated the following peaks: 381 Ma (20 percent), 409 Ma (26 percent), 422 Ma (24 percent), 433 Ma (26 percent), 452 Ma (3 percent), and 482 Ma (2 percent).

Detailed consideration of the petrogenesis of the Late Devonian–early Mississippian arc rocks in the Northern Sierra terrane is beyond the scope of the present study but is clearly an important avenue for future research.Late Devonian–Early Mississippian Evolution of the Northern Sierra Terrane

Together with evidence that Upper Devonian strata in the Grizzly Formation (Fig9) accumulated in an active trench-slope-basin setting (Girty et al., 1991), these data indicate that a relatively narrow time interval separated final stages of assembly of the Shoo Fly Complex and Late Devonian arc magmatism in the Northern Sierra terrane
9) accumulated in an active trench-slope-basin setting (Girty et al., 1991), these data indicate that a relatively narrow time interval separated final stages of assembly of the Shoo Fly Complex and Late Devonian arc magmatism in the Northern Sierra terraneThis in turn implies an abrupt shift in the location of the active volcanic arc, and a simple explanation for this would be slab rollback, causing the arc front to migrate onto parts of its accretionary complex.
Our new detrital zircon analyses for a sandstone block within the mélange reveal an age distribution dominated by Ordovician to Early Devonian grains, which is similar to results from one of the sandstone blocks analyzed by Grove et al(2008)
These results are consistent with Late Devonian deposition of sandstone making up some of the blocks within the mélange, which would be in accord with other evidence showing that onset of Late Devonian arc magmatism in the Northern Sierra terrane in the study area only slightly postdated formation of at least parts of the mélangeMore precise analyses (e.g., chemical-abrasion isotope-dilution TIMS) of these relatively young zircons are needed to adequately address this issue.
We infer that as the Late Devonian arc front shifted onto that part of theShoo Fly Complex, uprising arc magma had difficulty penetrating through this thick package of dominantly low-density sedimentary material due to buoyancy constraints
This process resulted in a high proportion of felsic relative to mafic and intermediate rock in the Sierra Buttes Formation and associated subvolcanic plutons, in comparison to most of the younger Paleozoic arc rocks in the Northern Sierra terraneSuch a model is consistent with low initial Nd isotopic ratios in some Sierra Buttes felsic rocks (Rouer et al., 1989; Silva et al., 2000)
Nelson (2009, 2011), the Late Devonian–early Mississippian arc in the Northern Sierra terrane was considered to have developed on top of the Shoo Fly Complex when the terrane lay west of the passive margin in Nevada, with the arc playing an important role in driving Late Devonian to early Mississippian east-vergent thrusting of deep-marine Cambrian to Middle Devonian strata in the Roberts Mountains allochthon over the passive margin during the Antler orogenyThis event was inferred to record (1) back-arc thrusting behind a west-facing arc; (2) compressional deformation linked to encroachment of an east-facing arc; or (3) some combination of both, such as a flip in subduction polarity (e.g., Schweickert and Snyder, 1981; Miller et al., 1984, 1992; Burchfiel and Royden, 1991; Dickinson, 2000)
Our new geochronological data confirm that Late Devonian–early Mississippian arc magmatism in the Northern Sierra overlapped in time with the Antler orogeny, but increasing evidence for southward transport of Paleozoic terranes outboard of a transform boundary along the western Laurentian margin requires reevaluation of traditional models for the Antler event.Colpron and Nelson (2009) argued that the Sierra City mélange formed during early Paleozoic subduction within the Arctic realm and then became one of the terranes caught up within the subduction system that migrated westward in the middle Paleozoic through the “Northwest Passage” along the northern Laurentian margin
Colpron and Nelson (2009) argued that the Sierra City mélange formed during early Paleozoic subduction within the Arctic realm and then became one of the terranes caught up within the subduction system that migrated westward in the middle Paleozoic through the “Northwest Passage” along the northern Laurentian marginDuring its westward migration, the terrane was tectonically juxtaposed with the rocks making up the lower three structural panels in the Shoo Fly Complex, which contain detrital zircon age spectra consistent with a northwest Laurentian provenance (Harding et al., 2000)
Transport of the resulting composite terrane along the sinistral transform boundary parallel to the western Laurentia margin brought the terrane to a position off the passive margin in Nevada in time for it to serve as basement upon which the Late Devonian–early Mississippian northern Sierran arc was built.More recently, Linde et al
This must have begun in Frasnian time, as indicated by depositional patterns of strata in the Antler foredeep basin and associated backbulge and forebulge regions, and it was followed by Famennian–early Mississippian emplacement of the Roberts Mountains allochthon on top of the passive margin (Goebel, 1991; Dickinson, 2000, 2006)There is no direct evidence, however, that the Shoo Fly Complex was thrust onto the passive margin, suggesting that it arrived in a position close to the margin but did not collide with it.
This model is supported by the fact that initial stages of the development of the Havallah basin coincided with Late Devonian magmatism in the northern Sierra arc, as shown by the presence of Famennian fossils both in the Sierra Buttes Formation (Hanson and Schweickert, 1986) and in basal strata within the Havallah basin (Miller et al., 1984, 1992)Placing the mid-Paleozoic northern Sierran arc directly outboard of the Havallah basin also provides a source for influx of significant amounts of arc-type volcaniclastic debris that was shed from the west in the early Mississippian (Kinderhookian) into parts of the Havallah basin (Miller et al., 1984, 1992; Harwood and Murchey, 1990; Whiteford, 1990).
Placing the mid-Paleozoic northern Sierran arc directly outboard of the Havallah basin also provides a source for influx of significant amounts of arc-type volcaniclastic debris that was shed from the west in the early Mississippian (Kinderhookian) into parts of the Havallah basin (Miller et al., 1984, 1992; Harwood and Murchey, 1990; Whiteford, 1990).We know of no evidence requiring that strata in the lower three structural panels in the Shoo Fly Complex were already imbricated by thrusting prior to their southward transport along the western Laurentian margin
In contrast to Colpron and Nelson (2009), we infer that west-vergent thrusting of Shoo Fly strata occurred in the accretionary complex associated with the west-facing Devonian northern Sierran arc, along with formation and thrust emplacement of the Sierra City mélange in the growing forearc complexThis interpretation is supported by evidence that some sediment masses within the mélange were mixed together prior to lithification and were still poorly consolidated when Late Devonian hypabyssal intrusions were injected into them (Girty and Pardini, 1987; Mount, 1990); it is also consistent with the fact that limited numbers of zircons from sandstone blocks within the mélange have yielded U-Pb ages as young as Late Devonian, although as noted above, additional work is needed to clarify the significance of these data.

Ediacaran tonalite blocks and detrital zircons with non–western Laurentian age spectra in the Sierra City mélange still must be explainedWe suggest that this material was derived from a continuation of the Yreka and Trinity terranes within the eastern Klamath Mountains, or smaller terranes related to them that are no longer preserved, which were in close proximity to the developing Late Devonian northern Sierran arc
We suggest that this material was derived from a continuation of the Yreka and Trinity terranes within the eastern Klamath Mountains, or smaller terranes related to them that are no longer preserved, which were in close proximity to the developing Late Devonian northern Sierran arcThis interpretation is consistent with the presence of closely similar faunal assemblages in limestone blocks (Potter et al., 1990), similarities in detrital zircon populations in sandstone blocks, and tonalite blocks with Ediacaran zircon ages in both the Sierra City mélange and the Yreka terrane (Grove et al., 2008)
This interpretation is consistent with the presence of closely similar faunal assemblages in limestone blocks (Potter et al., 1990), similarities in detrital zircon populations in sandstone blocks, and tonalite blocks with Ediacaran zircon ages in both the Sierra City mélange and the Yreka terrane (Grove et al., 2008)Ediacaran tonalites also occur in the Trinity terrane (Wallin et al., 1988; Lindsley-Griffin et al., 2008)
Ediacaran tonalites also occur in the Trinity terrane (Wallin et al., 1988; Lindsley-Griffin et al., 2008)Possibly, parts of these older convergent margin assemblages were tectonically juxtaposed with the developing Late Devonian subduction complex in the Northern Sierra terrane and were incorporated into the younger subduction zone
Possibly, parts of these older convergent margin assemblages were tectonically juxtaposed with the developing Late Devonian subduction complex in the Northern Sierra terrane and were incorporated into the younger subduction zoneOrdovician to Early Devonian zircons found in two sandstone blocks in the Sierra City mélange (Grove et al., 2008; this paper) also could have been derived from parts of the Yreka and Trinity terranes and the Lower to Middle Devonian arc sequence in the Redding section in the eastern Klamath Mountains, which contain detrital zircons or record igneous activity in the same time frame (Dickinson, 2000; Grove et al., 2008; Lindsley-Griffin et al., 2008)
Ordovician to Early Devonian zircons found in two sandstone blocks in the Sierra City mélange (Grove et al., 2008; this paper) also could have been derived from parts of the Yreka and Trinity terranes and the Lower to Middle Devonian arc sequence in the Redding section in the eastern Klamath Mountains, which contain detrital zircons or record igneous activity in the same time frame (Dickinson, 2000; Grove et al., 2008; Lindsley-Griffin et al., 2008)However, the starved-basin hemipelagic Upper Mississippian–Upper Pennsylvanian deposits of the upper Peale Formation in the Northern Sierra terrane show little similarity with age-equivalent strata in the Redding section, which record Late Devonian(?) to middle Mississippian clastic input followed by Pennsylvanian arc magmatism (Watkins, 1990)
However, the starved-basin hemipelagic Upper Mississippian–Upper Pennsylvanian deposits of the upper Peale Formation in the Northern Sierra terrane show little similarity with age-equivalent strata in the Redding section, which record Late Devonian(?) to middle Mississippian clastic input followed by Pennsylvanian arc magmatism (Watkins, 1990)This suggests the two terranes became separated after the Early to Middle Devonian, although the histories of the two terranes converged in the mid-Permian, when they both became part of the McCloud arc festoon (Miller, 1987) and were then accreted to western Laurentia during the Sonoma orogeny.
This suggests the two terranes became separated after the Early to Middle Devonian, although the histories of the two terranes converged in the mid-Permian, when they both became part of the McCloud arc festoon (Miller, 1987) and were then accreted to western Laurentia during the Sonoma orogeny.It should be remembered that the present relative positions of the Northern Sierra terrane and the Yreka and Trinity terranes and Redding section in the eastern Klamath Mountains are the result of a long series of tectonic events that transpired following the early to mid-Paleozoic convergent margin tectonism recorded within them
It should be remembered that the present relative positions of the Northern Sierra terrane and the Yreka and Trinity terranes and Redding section in the eastern Klamath Mountains are the result of a long series of tectonic events that transpired following the early to mid-Paleozoic convergent margin tectonism recorded within themBecause Permian strata within these terranes contain the McCloud fauna, they must have migrated far into the ancestral northeast Pacific as the Slide Mountain ocean progressively opened
Because Permian strata within these terranes contain the McCloud fauna, they must have migrated far into the ancestral northeast Pacific as the Slide Mountain ocean progressively openedThe terranes must then have migrated back to the western Laurentian margin as that ocean closed in order to become involved in the Permian–Triassic Sonoma orogeny and were subsequently displaced again during Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonism, as described by Dickinson (2006)
The terranes must then have migrated back to the western Laurentian margin as that ocean closed in order to become involved in the Permian–Triassic Sonoma orogeny and were subsequently displaced again during Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonism, as described by Dickinson (2006)Thus, the present spatial arrangement of the Northern Sierra terrane and the eastern Klamath terranes may have little bearing on their original relative positions in the Late Devonian
Thus, the present spatial arrangement of the Northern Sierra terrane and the eastern Klamath terranes may have little bearing on their original relative positions in the Late DevonianPerhaps the presence of tonalite blocks and detrital zircons in sandstone blocks in the Sierra City mélange in the Northern Sierra terrane having similar non–western Laurentian age signatures to Early Devonian and older units in the eastern Klamath terranes provides an important clue as to their spatial relations prior to opening of the Slide Mountain ocean.
