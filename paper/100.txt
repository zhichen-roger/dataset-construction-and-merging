Combining these fission-track data and the published geologic, sedimentological, and thermochronologic data from the northern Qilian Shan and Hexi Corridor, we propose a progressively north-northeastward growth model for the northernmost part of Tibet, suggesting that deformation in the inner Qilian Shan occurred synchronously in the middle Miocene, and subsequently, increasingly further north.The collision between India and Eurasia resulted in widespread deformation throughout the continental interior of Eurasia, producing the crust-thickened Tibetan Plateau and its deformed surrounding regions (e.g., Molnar and Tapponnier, 1975; Tapponnier and Molnar, 1979)
Several prior works concluded that early, collision-age defor ma tion occurred not only in southern Tibet near the India-Eurasia collision zone, but also in northern Tibet (e.g., Clark et al., 2010; Clark, 2012; Dayem et al., 2009), whereas others share the view that crustal thickening resulting from India’s northward advance into Eurasia has propagated northward in time, first accumulating at the plate boundary and starting in the Miocene to Plio-Quaternary in northern Tibet (e.g., Meyer et al., 1998; Tapponnier et al., 2001; Royden et al., 2008; Molnar and Stock, 2009)Although a growing body of evidence for the deformation timing and styles in different parts of Tibet has been achieved, further work is needed to understand the mechanism of crustal thickening of the plateau.
Several studies have been conducted to constrain the depositional histories and evolution of these intermountain basins, suggesting both earlier Cenozoic tectonic activity during the Eocene–Oligocene (e.g., Dupont-Nivet et al., 2004; Horton et al., 2004; Dai et al., 2006) and Miocene crustal shortening in the northern Tibetan Plateau (e.g., Fang et al., 2003, 2007; Lease et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011, 2013, 2016a, 2016b)Thermochronologic exhumation records in the elongated mountain ranges show that uplift occurred both in the early Cenozoic, during the Eocene (e.g., Jolivet et al., 2001; Clark et al., 2010; Duvall et al., 2011), and also in the late Cenozoic (e.g., George et al., 2001; Zheng et al., 2006, 2010; Lease et al., 2011)
Thermochronologic exhumation records in the elongated mountain ranges show that uplift occurred both in the early Cenozoic, during the Eocene (e.g., Jolivet et al., 2001; Clark et al., 2010; Duvall et al., 2011), and also in the late Cenozoic (e.g., George et al., 2001; Zheng et al., 2006, 2010; Lease et al., 2011)Because these constraints on the timing of initial deformation are inconsistent, it remains controversial as to whether the northern Tibetan Plateau tion with emergence of existing high terrain in the Miocene (Clark et al., 2010; Lease et al., 2012), or as a series of northward steps sequentially producing high topographic regions separated by basins (Meyer et al., 1998; Tapponnier et al., 2001).
Because these constraints on the timing of initial deformation are inconsistent, it remains controversial as to whether the northern Tibetan Plateau tion with emergence of existing high terrain in the Miocene (Clark et al., 2010; Lease et al., 2012), or as a series of northward steps sequentially producing high topographic regions separated by basins (Meyer et al., 1998; Tapponnier et al., 2001).To date, most thermochronologic data relevant to range uplift in northern Tibet were collected in the eastern Qilian Shan and the western Qinling range (e.g., Zheng et al., 2006; Clark et al., 2010; Duvall et al., 2011; Lease et al., 2011)
In the inner and western Qilian Shan, these data indicate that the exhumation response to Cenozoic thrust and reverse faulting was insufficient to yield completely reset ages (George et al., 2001; Jolivet et al., 2001)The Qilian Shan is large, extending between the Qaidam Basin to the south and the Hexi Corridor to the north, entailing a width of ~300 km and length of >1000 km
It is entirely possible that it may have undergone initial deformation diachronously, and could also have experienced deformation styles during the Cenozoic that differ from those observed in the eastern Qilian ShanHence, more work on deformation timing and patterns in different parts of the Qilian Shan is required to understand the uplift and expansion mechanism of the Tibetan Plateau
To the north, it is bounded by the Zoulang Nan Shan, which is mainly composed of metamorphic Paleozoic rocks that were thrusted in a northeastern direction over the Cenozoic sedimentary rocks in the Hexi Corridor (Gansu Geological Bureau, 1989)To the south the basin is bounded by the eastern Tuolai Shan, which is composed of folded late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic sediments and Precambrian metamorphic rocks (QBGMR, 1968)
To the south the basin is bounded by the eastern Tuolai Shan, which is composed of folded late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic sediments and Precambrian metamorphic rocks (QBGMR, 1968)Rock units exposed in the Qilian Basin are dominated by Cretaceous conglomerate or sandstone and Quaternary alluvium, with sparse Neogene sandstone exposed (QBGMR, 1968)
Rock units exposed in the Qilian Basin are dominated by Cretaceous conglomerate or sandstone and Quaternary alluvium, with sparse Neogene sandstone exposed (QBGMR, 1968)Using magnetostratigraphic and detrital fission-track data from the Qilian Basin, Liu et al
Along the northern range front of the Tuolai Shan near the Qilian Basin, a thrust fault, the southern Qilian Basin fault, juxtaposes Precambrian metamorphic rocks over Cretaceous conglomerate or sandstone (QBGMR, 1968) (Fig2), although no evidence for late Quaternary activity along this fault has been found along the range front.
2), although no evidence for late Quaternary activity along this fault has been found along the range front.Because the Cenozoic sediments are distributed sparsely and thinly in the Qilian Basin, it is not easy to constrain the Cenozoic depositional history and evolution of the basin
Because the Cenozoic sediments are distributed sparsely and thinly in the Qilian Basin, it is not easy to constrain the Cenozoic depositional history and evolution of the basinHence studying the uplift history of the mountain nearby is required in order to understand both the Cenozoic deformation around the Qilian Basin and its role in the deformation pattern of the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.
Hence studying the uplift history of the mountain nearby is required in order to understand both the Cenozoic deformation around the Qilian Basin and its role in the deformation pattern of the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau.Apatite fission-track (AFT) data provide information on the cooling path of thermochronology samples through the partial annealed zone (PAZ) at temperatures ranging from 60 to 110 ± 10 °C, corresponding to a depth of ~2–5 km (Laslett et al., 1987)
The units sampled are Cretaceous, Permian, Triassic, and Ordovician sandstones, Cambrian and Precambrian metamorphic rocks, and early Paleozoic granite (Fig2B)
Four samples (DCG13-02, DCG13-03, DCG13-04, DCG13-05) were collected from the footwall of the southern Qilian Basin fault; sample DCG13-01 is from Precambrian bedrock between the southern Qilian Basin fault and the Haiyuan fault; and the other five samples (DCG13-06, DCG13-07, DCG13-08, DCG13-09, DCG13-10) were collected from folded Paleozoic bedrock south of the Haiyuan fault (Fig2).
The four lowest-elevation samples (DCG13-02, DCG13-03, DCG13-04, DCG13-05) have older annealing ages ranging from 42.4 ± 2.4 to 53.8 ± 2.7 Ma, which are significantly younger than the depositional and magmatic ages of the rocks (Cretaceous sandstone and early Paleozoic granite) (Figs2 and 3)
To the south of the Haiyuan fault, three samples (DCG13-06, DCG13-07, DCG13-09) collected from late Paleozoic bedrock have mean fission-track ages ranging from 15.2 ± 0.8 to 17.6 ± 1.4 Ma (Figs2 and 3)
Further to the south, the highest-elevation sample (DCG13-10) has an annealing age of 34.1 ± 2.9 Ma, younger than its depositional age (Permian), whereas its mean fission-track length of 12.1 ± 1.59 μm is shorter than that of the other three samples south of the Haiyuan fault (Fig3).
To the south of the Haiyuan fault, the three samples (DCG13-06, DCG13-07, DCG13-09) have tightly clustered middle Miocene ages (15.2 ± 0.8 to 17.6 ± 1.4 Ma) and relatively longer confined fission-track lengths (≥13 μm), suggesting that these three samples have been strongly annealed and that their fission-track ages have been resetCompared to these three samples, the southernmost sample DCG13-10 has a relatively older fission-track age (34.1 ± 2.9 Ma) and a shorter confined fission-track length (12.1 ± 1.59 μm)
We interpret these samples as having undergone slow cooling within a Mesozoic to early Cenozoic PAZ (PAZ 1)However, four samples (DCG13-06, DCG13-07, DCG13-09, DCG13-10) collected from the hanging-
Light blue strip represents a partial annealing zone (PAZ 1) in the late Mesozoic to early Cenozoic, and the light yellow strip is interpreted as the Miocene partial annealing zone (PAZ 2)Grey strip is the inferred tendency of AFT ages and mean track lengths in the hanging wall of the Haiyuan fault.
Combining the different degrees of annealing and the small elevation separation (~160 m) between the samples DCG13-09 and DCG13-10, we infer that this break marks the base of an exhumed Miocene PAZ (PAZ 2) and defines the onset of a rapid cooling that occurred at ca17–15 Ma (Figs
(2) The Haiyuan fault extends across the Tuolai Shan to the south of Qilian town, cutting the Paleozoic to Mesozoic bedrock, although the total lateral strike slip is estimated to be only ~10 km (QBGMR, 1968; A llen et al., 2017)(3) Given rapid cooling ages observed in the Liupan Shan, a north-trending mountain range at the eastern end of the Haiyuan fault, Zheng et al
Combined with our data, these points suggest that the inner Qilian Shan experienced rapid exhumation in the mid-Miocene, and there is no evidence for left-lateral strike slip actually along the Haiyuan fault at that time.Therefore, we infer that the rapid cooling of the Tuolai Shan in the m iddle Miocene was driven by an earlier phase of thrust – not left lateral strike-slip – activity on the Haiyuan fault, (termed here the ancestral Haiyuan thrust fault) along the Tuolai Shan range front
Therefore, we infer that the rapid cooling of the Tuolai Shan in the m iddle Miocene was driven by an earlier phase of thrust – not left lateral strike-slip – activity on the Haiyuan fault, (termed here the ancestral Haiyuan thrust fault) along the Tuolai Shan range frontThen, induced by continued northward growth of the Tibetan Plateau, confined by the rigid Gobi Alashan block to the north (Dayem et al., 2009; Lease et al., 2011; Clark, 2012), the Miocene  Haiyuan thrust connected with other faults in the northeastern plateau and finally formed the ~1000-km-long, active, left-lateral strike-slip Haiyuan fault in a later phase during the middle to late Miocene (Zhang et al., 1991; Zheng et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2013)
Then, induced by continued northward growth of the Tibetan Plateau, confined by the rigid Gobi Alashan block to the north (Dayem et al., 2009; Lease et al., 2011; Clark, 2012), the Miocene  Haiyuan thrust connected with other faults in the northeastern plateau and finally formed the ~1000-km-long, active, left-lateral strike-slip Haiyuan fault in a later phase during the middle to late Miocene (Zhang et al., 1991; Zheng et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2013)This two-stage slip model of the Haiyuan fault zone coincides with the middle Miocene change in the kinematic style of plateau growth, from NNE-SSW contraction that mimicked the plate convergence direction to the inclusion of new structures accommodating east-west motion (Lease et al., 2011).
This two-stage slip model of the Haiyuan fault zone coincides with the middle Miocene change in the kinematic style of plateau growth, from NNE-SSW contraction that mimicked the plate convergence direction to the inclusion of new structures accommodating east-west motion (Lease et al., 2011).The 17–15 Ma timing of faulting found in this study agrees well with the increase in cooling rate and deposition throughout middle Miocene found in the Qilian Shan, Qaidam Basin, and Hexi Corridor (Fig

These temporally proximate processes indicate that the Qilian Shan experienced synchronous deformation in the middle MioceneNorthward Growth of the Northern Margin of the Qilian Shan
Synthesis of new AFT data from this study with published constraints on the timing of initial deformation within the northern Qilian Shan and Hexi Corridor allows us to explore the late Cenozoic deformation pattern of the region.Wang et al

We propose a north-northeastward progressive deformation pattern for the northernmost part of the Qilian Shan and Hexi Corridor from the Miocene to the Quaternary (Fig5B).
Northern Tibet, bounded by the Kunlun, Altyn Tagh, and Haiyuan fault systems, has been regarded as the Plio-Quaternary Tibet (Tapponnier et al., 2001)Northern Tibet consists of several parallel mountain ranges that are separated by subparallel intermontain basins (Fig
Prior to the Miocene, northern Tibet appears to have undergone contractional deformation and surface uplift ca45–50 Ma, beginning roughly near the onset of India-Eurasia collision (e.g., Jolivet et al., 2001; Yin et al., 2002, 2008; Horton et al., 2004; Dupont-Nivet et al., 2004; Clark et al., 2010; Duvall et al., 2011)
Evidence for deformation since the Miocene is distributed across northern Tibet (e.g., George et al., 2001; Fang et al., 2003; Palumbo et al., 2009; Zheng et al., 2006, 2010; Lease et al., 2011, 2012; Yuan et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2011, 2016a, 2016b; Zhuang et al., 2018).Focusing on the timing of initial deformation in the northern margin of the Qilian Shan and Hexi Corridor, we find that a progressive northward growth model since the early to middle Miocene is suitable (Fig
Focusing on the timing of initial deformation in the northern margin of the Qilian Shan and Hexi Corridor, we find that a progressive northward growth model since the early to middle Miocene is suitable (Fig5B)
To the north of the Hexi Corridor, a series of low-relief north-dipping thrust ramps lying parallel to the Qilian Shan range front are thought to have been active since the Quaternary (Zheng et al., 2013).Therefore, we suggest that the northernmost Qilian Shan has grown north-northeastward toward the foreland since the Miocene to create a series of parallel WNW-striking ramp anticlines and associated NNE–striking thrust faults
Therefore, we suggest that the northernmost Qilian Shan has grown north-northeastward toward the foreland since the Miocene to create a series of parallel WNW-striking ramp anticlines and associated NNE–striking thrust faultsForeland basins formed along the range fronts as the mountains uplifted, which then evolved into piggyback basins when the ranges to the north of these basins began to uplift, and finally became the subparallel elongated intermountain basins
Widespread middle Miocene deformation, as indicated by accelerated erosion and deposition not only in the northern Qilian Shan, but also in the southern Qilian Shan (Zhuang et al., 2018), northern Qaidam Basin (Fang et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2017), and western Qaidam Basin (e.g., Chang et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017), may therefore be inconsistent with a simple model of northward growth for northern TibetWidespread middle Miocene deformation across northern Tibet is consistent with the predicted timing of initial rapid outward growth driven by removal of mantle lithosphere from beneath Tibet (England and Houseman, 1989; Molnar and Stock, 2009).
Widespread middle Miocene deformation across northern Tibet is consistent with the predicted timing of initial rapid outward growth driven by removal of mantle lithosphere from beneath Tibet (England and Houseman, 1989; Molnar and Stock, 2009).This work provides new constraints on the onset of rapid cooling in northern Tibet by AFT thermochronometry in samples collected from the Tuolai Shan, one of the WNW- to NW-trending elongated mountain ranges in the Qilian Shan
