Tracking ancient magmatism and Cenozoic topographic growth within the Northern Andes forearc: Constraints from detrital U-Pb zircon agesC
A comparison of detrital zircon ages from the Cenozoic forearc basins in SW Ecuador–NW Peru and those derived from the Amotapes Massif offers a singular opportunity to shed some light on the evolution of the NW Andean margin of South AmericaAn extensive set of pre-Andean U-Pb zircon ages (older than Late Cretaceous) was obtained from 18 detrital samples coming from the Talara, Zorritos, Progreso, and Gulf of Guayaquil–Tumbes forearc basins, as well as from two metasedimentary rocks of the Amotapes Massif
An extensive set of pre-Andean U-Pb zircon ages (older than Late Cretaceous) was obtained from 18 detrital samples coming from the Talara, Zorritos, Progreso, and Gulf of Guayaquil–Tumbes forearc basins, as well as from two metasedimentary rocks of the Amotapes MassifU-Pb age analysis on detrital zircon grains allows a general source-to-sink scenario to be determined for this section of the Andes
320 Ma and Neoproterozoic clusters for the Amotapes metasediments show significant similarities along the strike of the metamorphic belt, thus defining a common metasedimentary origin, and can be compared with previously dated rocks from the Eastern Cordillera of PeruThese strong similarities demonstrate the presence of a wide, polyphased metamorphic belt that includes the western parts of the Eastern Cordillera, the northern section of the Occidental Cordillera of Peru, and the Amotapes Massif
Detrital sediments of the forearc are marked by a major gap in Early Cretaceous–Jurassic ages and the minor presence of Ordovician (Famatinian orogeny) and Carboniferous–Permian (340–285 Ma) ages
Permian (340–285 Ma) agesThe age spectrum is not compatible with sediment input from the eastern Andes and suggests that the external areas of the Andean chain (e.g., the Western Cordillera) were already uplifted prior to or immediately after forearc initiation during the Paleocene, thus representing a pervasive drainage divide throughout all of the Cenozoic
The age spectrum is not compatible with sediment input from the eastern Andes and suggests that the external areas of the Andean chain (e.g., the Western Cordillera) were already uplifted prior to or immediately after forearc initiation during the Paleocene, thus representing a pervasive drainage divide throughout all of the CenozoicThe Amotapes Massif or other terrains sharing the same age affinities (e.g., the  Olmos terrane; Occidental Cordillera of Peru) are likely to represent the best potential sources for pre-Andean zircon grains in the forearc
It is unlikely that the Neoproterozoic zircon grains came from the Pan African–Braziliano belts, thus suggesting the onset of significant magmatic activity in this section of the Andes at around 570–560 Ma and probably ca600 Ma
The 520 Ma cluster is compatible with the most prominent magmatic period in the southern Andes related to the end of the Pampean orogeny, thus suggesting the existence of a regional proto-Andean magmatic arc during Early Cambrian times.In subduction systems, the sediments in forearc basins may record a more complete history of magmatism and topographic growth than the present exposure of the arc itself
In this study, we propose a source-to-sink analysis in SW Ecuador and NW Peru using a comparison of the detrital zircon record within forearc Cenozoic strata and the ages of metamorphosed Paleozoic sediments of the Amotapes Massif in NW Peru.Detrital zircon age spectra are controlled mainly by the presence of synsedimentary igneous activity, the potential of zircon grain preser vation, and the degree of incorporation of older zircon grains into the sedimentary record (Cawood et al., 2012)
We report here a robust set of 1392 concordant detrital zircon U-Pb ages coming from sedimentary series spanning the early Paleocene to the late Miocene in the SW Ecuadorian and NW Peruvian forearcs and from two samples coming from metamorphic rocks cropping out in the Amotapes Massif in northern PeruApproximately 45 percent of forearc grains are from the Late Cretaceous to present modern volcanic arc, and the other data points constrain well-defined Neoproterozoic to Triassic populations, some of which have been hitherto unidentified in this section of the Andean chain
Approximately 45 percent of forearc grains are from the Late Cretaceous to present modern volcanic arc, and the other data points constrain well-defined Neoproterozoic to Triassic populations, some of which have been hitherto unidentified in this section of the Andean chainThe data also constrain pervasive Jurassic–Early Cretaceous and a lesser Late Ordovician–Middle Triassic age gaps
The data also constrain pervasive Jurassic–Early Cretaceous and a lesser Late Ordovician–Middle Triassic age gapsThe age spectra including main populations and gaps allow us to propose a general source-to-sink scenario, and provide significant insights about the age and the spatial evolution of the Cenozoic topographic growth and the proto Andean evolution.

There is a major debate on whether Andean construction took place during several pulses during the Cenozoic or whether most of its topographic growth took place recentlyHowever, a regional model describing uplift during different periods between the Late Cretaceous and the Eocene, followed by more significant uplift since the late Miocene and even the Pliocene, has gained acceptance (Gregory- Wodzicki, 2000; Garzione et al., 2008; Hoorn et al., 2010).
However, a regional model describing uplift during different periods between the Late Cretaceous and the Eocene, followed by more significant uplift since the late Miocene and even the Pliocene, has gained acceptance (Gregory- Wodzicki, 2000; Garzione et al., 2008; Hoorn et al., 2010).The Eastern Cordillera in Ecuador is mainly an assemblage of Paleozoic metasediments extensively intruded by Triassic and Jurassic– Early Cretaceous plutons (Aspden and Litherland, 1992; Litherland and Aspden, 1992;
The Eastern Cordillera in Ecuador is mainly an assemblage of Paleozoic metasediments extensively intruded by Triassic and Jurassic– Early Cretaceous plutons (Aspden and Litherland, 1992; Litherland and Aspden, 1992;Spikings et al., 2015), where the latter represent the long-lived expression of an active subduction system, with most intrusions ranging in age between 190 and 120 Ma (Aspden and Litherland, 1992; Noble et al., 1997)
The Jurassic arc has not been detected south of 6°S to 12°S (Spikings et al., 2015)However, a punctuated Early Jurassic intrusion has been observed at ~8°S near the western flank of the Eastern Cordillera (Mišković et al., 2009).

Paleozoic assemblages are also observed south of 6°S in the Eastern Cordillera of Peru, together with the well-defined Famatinian (ca470–440 Ma) and later Carboniferous–Permian (340–285 Ma) rocks resulting from magmatic and metamorphic events (Chew et al., 2007; Mišković et al., 2009)
470–440 Ma) and later Carboniferous–Permian (340–285 Ma) rocks resulting from magmatic and metamorphic events (Chew et al., 2007; Mišković et al., 2009)These Famatinian and Carboniferous–Permian events are not known in the Ecuadorian Cordilleras.
These Famatinian and Carboniferous–Permian events are not known in the Ecuadorian Cordilleras.In Ecuador, the Occidental Cordillera is Cretaceous in age and consists of oceanic accreted crust intruded by Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic plutons (Vallejo et al., 2009; Schütte et al., 2010)
In Ecuador, the Occidental Cordillera is Cretaceous in age and consists of oceanic accreted crust intruded by Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic plutons (Vallejo et al., 2009; Schütte et al., 2010)The Occidental Cordillera in Peru is composed of Late Cretaceous to Tertiary intrusive rocks and does not provide basement outcrops between 6°S and 14°S; this lack is in part responsible for the diverse hypotheses about its allochthonous versus parautochthonous origin (Polliand et al., 2005; Mišković et al., 2009;  Ramos, 2009; Romero et al., 2013)
The Occidental Cordillera in Peru is composed of Late Cretaceous to Tertiary intrusive rocks and does not provide basement outcrops between 6°S and 14°S; this lack is in part responsible for the diverse hypotheses about its allochthonous versus parautochthonous origin (Polliand et al., 2005; Mišković et al., 2009;  Ramos, 2009; Romero et al., 2013)The lack of Andean inherited zircon and an isotopically defined juvenile root in the Western Cordillera of Peru suggest the presence of young mafic crust that may have been at the origin of arc magmatism in the Coastal Batholith south of 7°S–9°S (Polliand et al., 2005)
Besides the Mesoproterozoic Grenville- Sunsas (1.3–1.0 Ga) event coeval with the accretion of the Arequipa-Antofalla basement (Fig1A; Loewy et al., 2004), the main pre- Andean orogenic events (as they are defined in the Central-South Andes) can be roughly divided into the events related to the Pampean orogeny (600–580 Ma to 520–490 Ma; Ramos, 2008; Steenken et al., 2011; Casquet et al., 2012; von Gosen et al., 2014) and those associated with Ordovician subduction (i.e., the Famatinian belt; Loewy et al., 2004; Rapela et al., 1998).

The definition of a Neoproterozoic magmatic event in central-north Peru was first suggested on the basis of U-Pb zircon lower-intercept dates between 630 and 610 Ma obtained from a migmatitic paragneiss (Dalmayrac et al., 1988)Metasediments and other metamorphic rocks cropping out in the Eastern Cordillera of Peru and Ecuador show an extensive volcanic (or recycled sedimentary) protolith with zircon apparent ages between 650 and 550 Ma (Chew et al., 2007; Cardona et al., 2009)
The definition of Neoproterozoic magmatic events has broad consequences, as they may indicate incomplete separation between western Gondwana and its conjugate rift margin on eastern Laurentia (Chew et al., 2008; Cardona et al., 2009)However, the absence of resolved punctual age populations within the 650–550 Ma interval prevents a further characterization of this process, and direct comparison with the betterdefined orogenic (magmatic or metamorphic) periods in the Southern Andes remains uncertain ( Ramos, 2008).
Other younger orogenies have been grouped into the so-called Gondwanan cycle (Pankhurst and Rapela, 1998; Mišković et al., 2009) and include a Carboniferous–Permian volcanic arcA noticeable lack of magmatism in the Central Andes during the Late Silurian and Devonian has been related to a passive margin developing to the west of the Famatinian arc (Bahlburg and Hervé, 1997).
A noticeable lack of magmatism in the Central Andes during the Late Silurian and Devonian has been related to a passive margin developing to the west of the Famatinian arc (Bahlburg and Hervé, 1997).The Amotapes Massif is an enigmatic arcuate polyphase metamorphic chain cropping out to the west of the main Andean Cordillera (Figs
Several Triassic intrusions are highly documented, most of them with ages ranging from 230 Ma to 220 MaThey have been ascribed to rifting processes at the northwest margin of Pangea during the separation of North and South America ( Aspden et al., 1992; Noble et al., 1997;  Cochrane et al., 2014; Riel et al., 2013; Spikings et al., 2015)
The first age constraint on the Amotapes protolith came from a Triassic granitoid, from which a single zircon core gave a Neop rotero zoic age of 546 ± 3 Ma, and this was attributed to recycling of material originally derived from the Amazonian craton (Noble et al., 1997).Paleomagnetic studies suggest that the massif underwent clockwise rotation of 110° for late Carboniferous units, and 35° for younger Cretaceous units (Mourier et al., 1988)
Paleomagnetic studies suggest that the massif underwent clockwise rotation of 110° for late Carboniferous units, and 35° for younger Cretaceous units (Mourier et al., 1988)Although there is almost no work dealing with the Paleozoic sections of the Amotapes Massif and its correlation with other Andean domains, it has been proposed that the Amotapes Massif corresponds to the southward prolongation of the Ecuadorian Eastern Cordillera, and that the metamorphic chain continues southward into the so-called Coastal Cordillera of Peru through basement inliers located at the Paita and Illescas Massifs (Fig
Although there is almost no work dealing with the Paleozoic sections of the Amotapes Massif and its correlation with other Andean domains, it has been proposed that the Amotapes Massif corresponds to the southward prolongation of the Ecuadorian Eastern Cordillera, and that the metamorphic chain continues southward into the so-called Coastal Cordillera of Peru through basement inliers located at the Paita and Illescas Massifs (Fig2; Aspden et al., 1992; Romero et al., 2013)
This correlation is mostly based on the similarities between the Triassic plutons intruding the Paleozoic metamorphic and metasedimentary units (Aspden et al., 1992; Noble et al., 1997; Romero et al., 2013;  Spikings et al., 2015)However, the Amotapes Massif is also believed to represent an allochthonous block accreted onto the South American margin in the Early Permian ( Ramos, 2009) or Early Cretaceous (Mourier et al., 1988; Winter et al., 2010)
However, the Amotapes Massif is also believed to represent an allochthonous block accreted onto the South American margin in the Early Permian ( Ramos, 2009) or Early Cretaceous (Mourier et al., 1988; Winter et al., 2010)The proposed ages for metamorphism vary
The continental margin of SW Ecuador and NW Peru has thick forearc basins resulting from long-lived subsidence during the Cretaceous up to the QuaternarySince the onset of subsidence, the major tectonic processes (some of them interrelated or in competition with one another) affecting the continental margin of north Peru–south Ecuador may include: (1) accretion of  exotic terranes (Jaillard et al., 1995); (2) breakup of the Farallon plate at ca
It consists of thick Cretaceous volcaniclastic and quartz-rich successions (Jaillard et al., 1999) with deposits and intrusions dated between 105 and 90 Ma at its eastern border (Winter et al., 2010) Jaillard et al
(2010) suggested that the timing of onset of rift-related volcanism during the Albian (or older) is assumed to represent the tectonic evidence of the opening of the south Atlantic Ocean and the breakup of Gondwana.The Cenozoic forearc is made up of several basins showing different subsidence and sedimentation paroxysms
The Cenozoic forearc is made up of several basins showing different subsidence and sedimentation paroxysmsThey include the Eocene Talara Basin, the Oligocene–Miocene Sechura, Progreso, and Zorritos Basins and the Pliocene–Quaternary Gulf of Guayaquil–Tumbes Basin (Fig
They include the Eocene Talara Basin, the Oligocene–Miocene Sechura, Progreso, and Zorritos Basins and the Pliocene–Quaternary Gulf of Guayaquil–Tumbes Basin (Fig2)
Forearc development started during the early Paleocene and continued almost continuously until the present day, with thick Quaternary deposits located in offshore areas in the Gulf of Guayaquil–Tumbes Basin (Witt et al., 2006; Witt and Bourgois, 2010)The axes of most of basins are aligned with the nearest basement faults, suggesting that there is a relationship between basin evolution and preexisting basement fabrics (Benitez, 1995)
Tectonic escape related to wrench tectonics and subduction erosion are among the processes generally invoked to account for the basin opening and the subsequent evolution during the Cenozoic (Benitez, 1995; Witt et al., 2006; Fildani et al., 2008; Winter et al., 2010; Witt and Bourgois, 2010)The timing, nature, and spatial character of the sedimentary processes are poorly correlated within the coeval basins throughout the Ecuador-Peru border area
To identify the sediment provenances, we collected 14 sandstone samples from the Paleocene to the late Miocene sedimentary outcrops in the Progreso, Gulf of Guayaquil–Tumbes, Zorritos, and Talara BasinsSampled localities are shown in Figure 2 and listed in the caption
All four cuttings are believed to come from middle– late Miocene series, as suggested by seismic observations, well-to-well correlations, and finally maximum depositional ages obtained in this workTwo reworked tuffs (samples CZ015 and CT001) were collected in the Eocene Talara  Basin

Detrital data show three main highly concordant Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian clusters at ca520 Ma, 560–570 Ma, and 600 Ma (Fig

As explained in the methodology section, we are not able to consider the few single ages that fall into the Jurassic–Early Cretaceous gap as real agesData from the offshore Amistad well (n = 288) have a similar distribution, with an age gap in the 210–120 Ma interval (Fig
The Late Ordovician–Early Triassic gap is also visible between 450 and 275 MaOnly 18 dates (1.3 percent of all ages) fall within errors into the 474–442 Ma interval, which is related to the Famatinian subduction-related magmatic belt (Chew et al., 2007)
Similarly, only 13 ages (~1 percent of all ages) fall into the suggested 340–285 Ma Carboniferous–Permian continental arc (Mišković et al., 2009)Both Famatinian and Carboniferous–Permian belts have been identified in the Peruvian Eastern Cordillera (Mišković et al., 2009).
Both Famatinian and Carboniferous–Permian belts have been identified in the Peruvian Eastern Cordillera (Mišković et al., 2009).The 1000–950 Ma cluster defines the expected component related to Grenvillian- Sunsas– type basements (Fig
This seems to be the case for the Paleozoic rocks of the Eastern Cordillera and the Amotapes Massif, which show significant Neoproterozoic–Early Cambrian zircon grains that correspond to the second most prominent age group of pre-Andean ages after the 250– 200 Ma one (Figs3, 4, and 7).
Zircon ages ranging from 650 to 550 Ma obtained from metasediments from the Eastern Cordillera of Peru attest to the existence of Neoproterozoic–Early Cambrian volcanism (Chew et al., 2007, 2008; Cardona et al., 2009)A significant component of 650–550 Ma grains is observed in sediments or in the metasedimentary series in the Southern Andes (Fig
In the Peruvian Andes, this extensive Neoproterozoic–Early Cambrian detrital record may be related to a felsic-intermediate magmatic source supposedly having an arc affinity that was formed by at least by 640 Ma (Cardona et al., 2009)The 650–550 Ma age component has been tentatively related to the existence of a pre-orogenic phase of the Pampean subductionrelated magmatism in this section of the Andes, with the products of this magmatic arc being currently buried beneath the modern Andes volcanic and sedimentary products (Chew et al., 2007)
Our data yielded two well-defined populations within the Neoproterozoic–Early Paleozoic cluster at 570–560 Ma and ca520 Ma; these ages were previously unidentified in this section of the chain (Figs
These Neoproterozoic–Cambrian clusters are not present in all our dated series and may reflect a complex interaction between the metasedimentary source and the forearc, probably related to local changes in sourcing.The ca
Although Neoproterozoic sedimentary protoliths (ca630–600 Ma) in the Pampean and Famatinian belts are conspicuously observed in the zircon record (Rapela et al., 2007; Collo et al., 2009), very few coeval intrusive ages have been observed

Ages in Peru are grouped into larger periods (Paleocene–Eocene and Miocene–Oligocene) because of the lower number of ages and a higher imprecision of the depositional ageN refers to the totality of measured ages for each period; n refers to ages falling into the 1200–200 Ma interval.

It has been observed in the Eocene series from both Ecuador and Peru (this work; Hessler and Fildani, 2015), and in the onshore and offshore Miocene series of EcuadorThe peak is also observed in both samples from the Amotapes Massif
570–560 Ma peak is reasonably coincident with the peak of Neoproterozoic ages obtained in the Andes of northern Peru (Fig7B; Chew et al., 2007)
It has been suggested that sedimentation at the proto-Pacific border in this basin was not only the result of accumulation of sediments derived from the Gondwana margin in a passivemargin setting, but that they were also sourced from evolving orogenic events when the South American and African cratons collided during the late Neoproterozoic (Adams et al., 2011).The abundance of detrital zircon grains obtained in this study intuitively defines a late Neoprotero zoic magmatic arc in this section of the Northern Andes
Furthermore, it is unlikely that Neoproterozoic zircon grains originated from cratonic (e.g., Pan African–Braziliano) belts, which are mostly located in SE South America (Fig1A), thus suggesting the onset of significant magmatic activity in the Northern Andes (south Ecuador and north Peru) around 570– 560 Ma
The 520 Ma cluster defined here is observed in rocks from the Amotapes Massif and in the offshore Miocene seriesAs with the 570– 560 Ma cluster, no cratonic sources may explain the presence of ca
The Amotapes Massif offers a valuable opportunity to analyze ancient Andean processes because it was not significantly affected by the Cretaceous to Tertiary intrusive and volcanic events, such as the ones that mask the ancient history of the Occidental Cordillera in PeruThe presence of inherited zircon grains yielding a wide range of dates likely indicates a recycled sedimentary and/or volcanic protolith for both samples from the Amotapes Massif (Fig
Indeed, (1) the two late Mississippian– early Pennsylvanian maximum depositional ages (younger zircon ages) obtained in this work (329.8 ± 4.03 Ma and 319.4 ± 3.74 Ma) are comparable within errors with the three maximum depositional ages obtained for the Western Schist Belt (333 ± 2.8 Ma, 327 ± 3.4 Ma, and 316 ± 9 Ma), and (2) the major age clustering in the Western Schist Belt at ca560–540 Ma is comparable with the 570–560 Ma cluster obtained here (data from Cardona et al
Opinions diverge about the autochthonous or allochthonous origin of the metamorphosed Paleozoic series in the Eastern Cordillera of Ecua dor (e.g., Litherland et al., 1994; Pratt et al., 2005) Although age and lithology similarities for the Paleozoic series outcropping in the Amotapes Massif and Eastern Cordilleras have been proposed in the past, the Amotapes Massif has also been considered as an allochthonous chain accreted to the continental margin during the Late Cretaceous (Mourier et al., 1988; Winter et al., 2010)An autochthonous origin for the Amotapes Massif is preferred based on our data set, especially because of the similarities between age clusters and maximum depositional ages between Amotapes rocks and those outcropping in the Eastern Cordilleras of Ecuador and Peru
The detrital zircon grains from the analyzed forearc area mainly originated from the Occidental Cordilleras of Ecuador and Peru, where a volcanic arc was active during most of the CenozoicAdditionally, data obtained in this work show that zircon grains older than the Late Cretaceous either came directly from the Amotapes Massif or from a source sharing the same age affinities
Additionally, data obtained in this work show that zircon grains older than the Late Cretaceous either came directly from the Amotapes Massif or from a source sharing the same age affinitiesWe propose that in the latter scenario, the Paleozoic basement of the Occidental Cordillera of Peru may correspond to the best potential source, a conclusion reached in a recent source-to-sink analysis in the Talara Basin (Hessler and Fildani, 2015).
We propose that in the latter scenario, the Paleozoic basement of the Occidental Cordillera of Peru may correspond to the best potential source, a conclusion reached in a recent source-to-sink analysis in the Talara Basin (Hessler and Fildani, 2015).It is very unlikely that the forearc sediments were sourced from the Eastern Cordilleras (Ecua dor and Peru) since the Early Cretaceous– Jurassic, because, to a lesser extent, the Devonian and Permian–Carboniferous gaps observed in the forearc detrital record (Fig
It is very unlikely that the forearc sediments were sourced from the Eastern Cordilleras (Ecua dor and Peru) since the Early Cretaceous– Jurassic, because, to a lesser extent, the Devonian and Permian–Carboniferous gaps observed in the forearc detrital record (Fig4A) are incompatible with the extensively dated intrusions outcropping in the Eastern Cordilleras of Ecuador and Peru (Chew et al., 2007; Mišković et al., 2009; Spikings et al., 2015)
Apatite and zircon fission-track studies suggest that the Ecuadorian section of the Amotapes may have experienced uplift during the Eocene (40–35 Ma; although other areas may have experienced onset of exhumation at ca70 Ma; Spikings et al., 2005, 2010)
Younger exhumation ages (late Miocene) have also been obtained for the Amotapes in north Peru (Espurt et al., 2014)The difficulty in proposing a wellconstrained exhumation scenario for this part of the Andes may arise because: (1) there are no real constraints for the net surface uplift during each cooling period, and (2) the accumulation of Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary arc intrusive and volcanic rocks in the Occidental Cordillera of Ecuador and Peru may complicate the analysis of the cooling related to exhumation
The difficulty in proposing a wellconstrained exhumation scenario for this part of the Andes may arise because: (1) there are no real constraints for the net surface uplift during each cooling period, and (2) the accumulation of Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary arc intrusive and volcanic rocks in the Occidental Cordillera of Ecuador and Peru may complicate the analysis of the cooling related to exhumationHowever, exhumation ages suggest that the Occidental Cordillera of Ecuador and Peru may have been eroded and therefore sourcing the forearc area since at least 65 Ma.
Independent of the thermochronological records, the provenance analysis presented in this study suggests that the Occidental Cordilleras of Ecuador and the Amotapes or related terrains (e.g., the Peruvian Occidental Cordillera) were uplifted during the early onset of forearc basins in Paleocene times and that they represented drainage divides until at least the late Miocene (age of the younger sediments analyzed in this study)At a regional scale, this scenario is in a good agreement with recently published works dealing with chain-forearc relationships in terms of uplift and resulting sourcing
Whether most of the uplift (rock or surface uplift) of the Occidental Cordilleras is recent or not, the altitude reached by the Occidental Cordillera at the onset of the forearc basins is high enough to represent a drainage divide that persisted through all of the CenozoicThis scenario is in disagreement with previous models that propose direct connections between the Pacific Ocean and the intermountain basins in Ecuador (Hungerbühler et al., 2002) and between the forearc and Amazonia (Hessler and Fildani, 2015).
U-Pb dating carried on Paleozoic metasediments outcropping in the Amotapes Massif points to a similar protolith along strike, from the north section of the massif all the way down to its southernmost outcropping sections at the Illescas MassifAge spectra of the Amotapes metasediments show striking similarities with others metasediments from the Eastern Cord illera of Peru
The evidence presented here most likely suggests an autochthonous origin for the massif, where its current position apart from the main cordillera was most probably controlled by Late Cretaceous to Tertiary rotation and rifting beneath the Lancones and Sechura Basins.Populations previously dated between 650 and 550 Ma in the Eastern Cordillera of Peru (e.g., Chew et al., 2007; Cardona et al., 2009) are better resolved in the forearc realm
600 Ma and the 570–560 Ma components most likely define a Neoproterozoic magmatic arc emplaced in the Andes during this period, since sourcing from the coeval Pan African– Braziliano belts is difficult to conceive for this section of the chain because outcrops related to these belts are only observed in SE South AmericaThese clusters cannot be correlated with other magmatic periods observed in the Southern Andes
The Cenozoic detrital zircon record obtained from forearc sediments around the EcuadorPeru border reflects pervasive zircon sourcing from the Occidental Cordilleras in Ecuador and Peru where a magmatic arc was active for all of the CenozoicInputs of zircon grains older than the Late Cretaceous (ca
Inputs of zircon grains older than the Late Cretaceous (ca100 Ma) probably originated from the Amotapes Massif and from other terrains sharing age affinities (i.e., the Occi dental Cordillera of Peru)
Jurassic and, to a lesser extent, Ordovician and Carboniferous age gaps demonstrate that the Eastern Cordillera is not a plausible source for the sedimentsTherefore, it is proposed that the Occidental Cord illera acted as a topographic barrier sufficiently high to impede sediment transportation from the interior of the Andes to the forearc area during all of the Cenozoic.
Therefore, it is proposed that the Occidental Cord illera acted as a topographic barrier sufficiently high to impede sediment transportation from the interior of the Andes to the forearc area during all of the Cenozoic.We wish to thank Manuel Rivera (P etroamazonas) for his help during the evolution of this project
