The preservation of these terrestrial strata allows for expansion of the Saddle Mountains anticline deformation history into post–mid-Miocene time.In this work, we examined the Ringold Formation and the magnitude of deformation of the Saddle Mountains anticline to reconstruct the chronology of deformation in central Washington
The Columbia River Basalt Group blanketed eastern Washington and Oregon in the Miocene (Reidel et al., 1989a, 1989b, 1994, 2013), and so the modern topography of the Yakima fold province has been generated since mid-Miocene time (Reidel, 1984; Watters, 1989)While the landscape of eastern and central Washington is largely mantled in Miocene flood basalts, exploratory oil and gas drilling has locally revealed the underlying stratigraphy
While the landscape of eastern and central Washington is largely mantled in Miocene flood basalts, exploratory oil and gas drilling has locally revealed the underlying stratigraphyIn the S addle Mountains, boreholes BN 1–9 and AF 1–6 (Figs
1 and 2; Czajkowski et al., 2012) reached depths >5.3 km and >4.3 km, respectively, and penetrated through the Columbia River Basalt Group and into the underlying  Eocene and Oligocene strata (Fig3; Fig
Because of their stratigraphic position below the Columbia River Basalt Group, the units identified as Ellensburg Formation in boreholes BN 1–9 and AF 1–6 are more likely either the andesitic to basaltic Oligocene Fifes Peak or the clastic and tuffaceous Ohanapecosh Formations (Fig3; Fiske, 1963; Smith, 1988; Tabor et al., 2000; Cheney, 2014; Jutzeler et al., 2014)
Logs from boreholes BN 1–9 and AF 1–6 indicate that basalt continues below the Columbia River Basalt Group strata (Wilson et al., 2008; Czajkowski et al., 2012), suggesting that the Oligocene strata are more likely the Fifes Peak Formation at these locations (FigDR1 [see footnote 1])
Beneath the Oligocene strata, boreholes penetrate into 240–400 m of mid-Eocene Wenatchee Formation and 520–1420 m of mid-late Eocene Roslyn Formation, both of which are typically fluvial and lacustrine in lithology (Fig3; Fig
1 penetrate into underlying Oligocene and Eocene strata, and the latter terminate in basement rock, thus limiting the pre-Miocene stratigraphic thickness locally to 1690 m (FigDR1 [see footnote 1])
Overall, the boreholes drilled near the Saddle Mountains show a northward thinning of pre-Miocene strata.The oldest rock unit exposed on the Saddle Mountains is the Grande Ronde Basalt, part of the Columbia River Basalt Group, emplaced 16.0–15.6 Ma (Fig
Existing mapping shows that these units overlie the 10.5–10.0 Ma Elephant Mountain Member and have been interpreted to be part of the Miocene–Pliocene Ringold Formation (Packer and Johnson, 1979; Repenning, 1987; Reidel, 1988; Morgan and Morgan, 1995)Paleo magnetic studies conducted on the Taunton and White Bluffs exposures concluded that deposition of the upper Ringold Formation occurred during the Gilbert Epoch (Packer and Johnson, 1979) identified by Gradstein et al
CRBG—Columbia River Basalt Group; Plio.—Pliocene.During the latest Pleistocene, several cataclysmic outburst floods from glacial Lake Missoula flowed through the Crab Creek scablandschannel system, along the northern margin of the Saddle Mountains, and incised through the Saddle Mountains at what is now Sentinel Gap (Smith, 1993)
During the latest Pleistocene, several cataclysmic outburst floods from glacial Lake Missoula flowed through the Crab Creek scablandschannel system, along the northern margin of the Saddle Mountains, and incised through the Saddle Mountains at what is now Sentinel Gap (Smith, 1993)The floods through the Crab Creek channel likely eroded the western extent of the Smyrna Bench (Fig
At the exposure of the Saddle Mountains fault and along Smyrna Bench, the Saddle Mountains fault places Miocene ColumbiaRiver Basalt Group in the hanging wall over the Smyrna Bench, which is composed of Columbia River Basalt Group strata and suprabasaltic strata
While deformation along the Saddle Mountains is mainly preserved in the Columbia River Basalt Group, several studies have suggested that deformation initiated prior to the Miocene and continues today (Malone et al., 1975; West et al., 1996; Casale and Pratt, 2015)Seismicreflection data across the Saddle Mountains reveal a steepening of bedding orientations below ~4 km depth (Pratt, 2012; Casale and Pratt, 2015)
Results from borehole BN 1–9, drilled at the hinge of the Crest anticline (Czajkowski et al., 2012), indicate that the change in bedding orientations may occur between the Eocene Roslyn Formation (48–45 Ma; Tabor et al., 1984; Miller et al., 2009; Cheney, 2014) and the overlying mid-Eocene Wenatchee Formation (>44.5–34[?] Ma; Tabor et al., 1984; Gilmour, 2012; Cheney, 2014)This may suggest that displacement was accommodated along the Saddle Mountains anticline and/or Saddle Mountains fault between mid-late Eocene and early Oligocene time
This may suggest that displacement was accommodated along the Saddle Mountains anticline and/or Saddle Mountains fault between mid-late Eocene and early Oligocene timeSeismic-reflection and borehole data do not penetrate beneath the Roslyn Formation, and so we have little insight as to whether the initiation of deformation along the Saddle Mountains anticline and Saddle Mountains fault preceded or postdated Eocene deposition.
Seismic-reflection and borehole data do not penetrate beneath the Roslyn Formation, and so we have little insight as to whether the initiation of deformation along the Saddle Mountains anticline and Saddle Mountains fault preceded or postdated Eocene deposition.Variations in basalt flow thickness have been used to constrain the timing of deformation ( Reidel, 1984)
Folding of the Ringold Formation in the hanging wall of the Saddle Mountains fault suggests that N-S shortening across the Saddle Mountains fault likely continued into late Miocene–Pliocene time (Reidel, 1984)A paleoseismic study conducted along the Smyrna Bench provided evidence for Holocene deformation along the Saddle Mountains fault (West et al., 1996)
A paleoseismic study conducted along the Smyrna Bench provided evidence for Holocene deformation along the Saddle Mountains fault (West et al., 1996)Additionally, composite stress tensors from microearthquakes near the Saddle Mountains are compatible with N-S shortening and thus may indicate modern activity along the Saddle Mountains fault and associated anticlines (Malone et al., 1975).

This may indicate that, in the hanging wall, deposition of the Ringold Formation ceased in the late Miocene and/or that the preservation of younger Ringold strata is less complete in the hanging-wall than in the footwall sectionsIn summary, our new geochronologic age constraints suggest that the Ringold Formation was deposited between 9.5 and 3.5 Ma
As mentioned already, we interpret the concordant Pliocene zircon ages in 15SM004 to represent the timing of deposition and the older ages to represent reworked fluvial sandsIn addition to zircon dating, we identified monazite, rutile, garnet, and multiple zircon habits during mineral separation of these samples, one of which was taken from the hanging-wall strata (Fig
Based on these criteria, our results indicate that the only Snake River Plain samples that are statistically similar to our Ringold samples are modern Snake River (M5 and M6), the Pleistocene South Fork of the Snake River (P6), and the Pleistocene Bonanza Bar (P7; Fig10; Fig
The most abundant age population peaks that overlap between the Ringold and Snake River Plain samples are the Eocene Challis Volcanic Group and the Cretaceous Idaho Batholith, both of which are exposed primarily north of the Snake River Plain (Fig10; Fig
The zircons older than 250 Ma that overlap between Snake River Plain and Ringold samples include Precambrian age groups such as Grenville zircons, which were possibly recycled from central Idaho or the Idaho-Wyoming thrust belt (Stewart et al., 2001), the YavapaiMazatzal, which may be recycled from conglomerates in western Wyoming (Janecke et al., 2000), and Wyoming Province zircons exposed in western Wyoming near the South Fork of the Snake River (FigDR3 [see footnote 1]; Link et al., 2005)
Whether the similar age groups and statistical coefficients indicate that the Snake River itself flowed north of the Saddle Mountains during the Miocene is debatable (Fig10).

Steeper bed orientations in Eocene strata suggest pre-Miocene deformation on the Saddle Mountains anticline; however, the aeromagnetic data, isopach data, and the uniform shortening along each line-balanced layer suggest that the majority of deformation recorded in the Columbia River Basalt Group strata, and possibly the Oligocene strata, postdated the youngest basalt flow, the 10–10.5 Ma Elephant Mountain Member.While shortening in each balanced layer is uniform, the magnitude of slip increases with the age of the unit, from which we infer that the Saddle Mountains anticline is a fault-propagation fold (Suppe, 1985; Suppe and Medwedeff, 1990; Mitra, 1990), similar to other Yakima folds (Miller, 2014)
Thus, the amount of slip preserved in the upper units is an underestimate for the total Miocene to present slip historyTo avoid underestimating total slip, and in turn slip rate, we measured the total offset from the oldest uniformly shortened unit, the Wenatchee
Miocene–Pliocene Structural and Stratigraphic Evolution of the Saddle MountainsUsing the new and published stratigraphic, structural, and geochronologic constraints, we reconstructed the geologic history of the Saddle Mountains
The onset of deformation likely predated the late Eocene–Oligocene deposition of the Fifes Peak/Ohanapecosh and Wenatchee Formations, based on the steepening of bedding orientations within the Roslyn Formation (Casale and Pratt, 2015)Based on the uniform magnitude of shortening preserved in post– Roslyn Formation strata, we infer that there was paucity of deformation from 45 Ma until at least 10 Ma along the Saddle Mountains anticline
Stratigraphic observations and tephra dating indicate that deposition of debris flows and mudflows continued throughout the late Miocene and into the Pliocene (until at least 3.5 Ma), which we interpret as continued anticlinal growth, relief generation, and hillslope erosion.Stratigraphic observations also allow us to characterize Miocene–Pliocene deformation along the Saddle Mountains anticline
Stratigraphic observations also allow us to characterize Miocene–Pliocene deformation along the Saddle Mountains anticlineThe  upper boundary of conglomerate-dominated strata in the hanging-wall sections is marked by a fluvial channel-fill horizon, below which we find d etrital zircon grains with distal provenance similar to that of the Snake River Plain
The presence of two marker beds in Miocene basaltic and suprabasaltic strata gives us the unique opportunity to estimate the magnitude of structural relief generated across the Saddle Mountains anticline over time (Suppe et al., 1992)We reconstructed the magnitude of structural relief generated by 6.8 Ma using the difference in the thickness of strata between the 10.5–10.0 Ma Elephant Mountain Member and the 6.8 Ma marker bed (Fig
Broadly, paleomagnetic measurements along the Saddle Mountains show between 10° and 15° of clockwise rotation in the hanging wall of the Saddle Mountains fault since the mid-Miocene, in comparison to only ~5° in the footwall (FigDR4 [see footnote 1]; Reidel et al., 1984)
Together, the slip gradient observed in structural data and paleomagnetic data sets suggest clockwise rotation has been accommodated along the Saddle Mountains fault since Miocene time.Several lines of evidence indicate that deformation along the Saddle Mountains continues today
However, several lines of evidence may suggest that the rate of defor mation currently accommodated along the Saddle Mountains anticline is greater than the long-term trend determined from Miocene strata.Paleoseismic work along the Saddle Mountains suggests that the late Quaternary to modern rate of slip along the Saddle Mountains fault is between 0.33 and 0.65 mm yr–1 (West et al., 1996), i.e., ~2–3 times greater than our calculated rate since 6.8 Ma, and, accordingly, ~24 percent–30 percent of the geodetic rate (McCaffrey et al., 2016)
Paleoseismic work along the Saddle Mountains suggests that the late Quaternary to modern rate of slip along the Saddle Mountains fault is between 0.33 and 0.65 mm yr–1 (West et al., 1996), i.e., ~2–3 times greater than our calculated rate since 6.8 Ma, and, accordingly, ~24 percent–30 percent of the geodetic rate (McCaffrey et al., 2016)Additionally, there are only a handful of other Yakima folds that likely accommodate N-S shortening between 120.1°W and 119.1°W, including the Frenchman Hills anticline, the Rattlesnake Hills anticline, and the Gable Mountains, which are the eastward extension of the Umtanum anticline

We find that the fluvial strata within the Ringold Formation were sourced from central Idaho since the late Miocene, from a similar source terrane as the modern–Pleistocene Snake RiverBased on our stratigraphic and structural analysis of the growth strata preserved within the Ringold Formation, we documented a previously unrecognized increase in the rate of shortening and slip accommodated along the Saddle Mountains fault
