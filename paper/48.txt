Upper Permian as a new play model on the mid-Norwegian continental shelf: Investigated by shallow stratigraphic drillingA 750 m–thick, fully marine succession of sandstones, coarsegrained turbidites, shales, and reworked sabkha sediments has been cored on the eastern margin of the mid-Norwegian shelf
The succession has been dated as Upper Permian–Lower Triassic and is comparable to rocks of the same age exposed onshore East GreenlandThese data demonstrate that the marine depositional basin between Greenland and Norway extended much farther east than previously thought.
This suggests that Upper Devonian–Lower Permian sediments were deposited on Caledonian basement east of the present-day limits of the basin.The cored succession also contains source rocks that can be stratigraphically correlated with the oil-prone source rocks of the Upper Permian Ravnefjeld Formation onshore East Greenland

Reworked fragments of reef-building organisms in Upper Permian turbidites and Upper Permian carbonates encountered in an exploration well on the Nordland Ridge indicate that carbonate deposition and reef building occurred on structural highs on the Trøndelag PlatformThe observations from the cored successions are key elements in a new Paleozoic play model on the midNorwegian continental shelf and include the first evidence for the existence of an Upper Permian source rock in the area, with Upper Permian carbonates or sandstones or Triassic–Jurassic sandstones as reservoir.

Hydrocarbon exploration in the Norwegian Sea since 1980 has demonstrated the existence of large oil, condensate, and gas discoveries sourced by Jurassic sedimentary rocksThese source rocks are generally thermally immature on the middle and inner shelf area
The recognition of a rich Upper Permian oil source rock (the Ravnefjeld Formation) in East Greenland (Surlyk et al., 1986; Christiansen et al., 1993) led to speculation as to whether a similar source rock could exist on the Norwegian continental shelfIf such a source rock exists, then the present Trøndelag Platform (Figure 1) is the most likely place for an Upper Permian source rock to be within the oil maturation window.
If such a source rock exists, then the present Trøndelag Platform (Figure 1) is the most likely place for an Upper Permian source rock to be within the oil maturation window.Prior to the present coring study, the only evidence for the existence of Permian sedimentary rocks in the areawas thepresence of 40 m of carbonates of supposed Late Permian age encountered in the exploration well 6609/7-1, which was drilled in 1984 on the Nordland Ridge (Figure 1)

Important information was obtained by reinvestigation of seabed grab samples, which yielded palynological evidence for marine Lower Triassic rocks in the areaAdditionally, the occurrence of reworked specimens of the genus Vittatina,which generally represents the Permian, in Quaternary clays, suggested that Permian rocks had been deposited and later eroded (Vigran and Mangerud, 1991)
Additionally, the occurrence of reworked specimens of the genus Vittatina,which generally represents the Permian, in Quaternary clays, suggested that Permian rocks had been deposited and later eroded (Vigran and Mangerud, 1991)Seismic studies and shallow coring (Bugge et al., 1984) identified areas of Lower Triassic rocks outcropping on the seabed

In a localized area close to the coast, however, there seemed to be possibilities of upper Paleozoic rocks being present only a few hundred meters below the seabedOn this basis, two shallow stratigraphic boreholes were drilled by IKU Petroleum Research in 1992
The cored marine Permian–Triassic succession was more than 750 m thick and contained oil-stained sandstone and mudstone with source rock potentialIn this article we present the cores and discuss the implications for geological models and hydrocarbon exploration in the area.
Upper Paleozoic sedimentary rocks overlie metamorphic basement on the Norwegian and the Greenland margins of the North AtlanticWith the exception of Devonian clastic rocks in intramontane basins on the Norwegian mainland, these Paleozoic sedimentary rocks only occur offshore on the Norwegian side (Sigmond, 1992) but are exposed onshore in East Greenland (Surlyk, 1990; Stemmerik et al., 1993).

A major middle Permian tectonic event can be recognized in East Greenland and throughout the ArcticIt caused a shift to generally deeper marine environments in the Barents Sea (Stemmerik and Worsley, 1989; Bugge et al., 1995), which led to the establishment of a seaway from the Barents Sea area southward and to the separation of Greenland and Norway (Surlyk et al., 1984; Dore´, 1991)
In East Greenland, this event caused a change from nonmarine Upper Devonian– Lower Permian deposition to dominantly marine deposition from the middle Permian onward (Figure 2) and the deposition of the Upper Permian Foldvik Creek Group (Surlyk et al., 1986; Stemmerik, 1987)In the North Sea, the middle Permian transgression led to the deposition of the evaporites and carbonates of the Zechstein Supergroup (Ziegler, 1981, 1990).
In the North Sea, the middle Permian transgression led to the deposition of the evaporites and carbonates of the Zechstein Supergroup (Ziegler, 1981, 1990).On the mid-Norwegian continental shelf, thepresence of Devonian–Early Permian sedimentary rocks is inferred from seismic data and by correlation with East Greenland (Bukovics and Ziegler, 1985; Schmidt, 1992)

The Upper Permian–Lower Triassic succession, equivalent to the Huledal to Wordie Creek formations, was cored in the shallow stratigraphic boreholes off Norway.The shallow cores were collected on the inner midNorwegian shelf in 1992 using the vessel M/V Bucentaur
The drilling locations were chosen where a strong seismic reflection, interpreted to represent the top of the Permian, was within reach of the shallow drilling equipmentTwo boreholes were drilled: hole 6611/ 09-U-01 down to 560 m below seabed and hole 6611/ 09-U-02 down to 280 m below seabed (Figure 3)
Water depth was 350 m, and the Quaternary overburden was 10 and 8 m thick at boreholes 1 and 2, respectivelyRecovery was very high (99 percent), and the cores, which are 54 mm in diameter, are of excellent quality
The shallow-marine sandstone unit, the anhydrite unit, and the lower turbidite unit have beendated as Late Permian (Ufimian–early Tatarian?)The upper turbidite unit is Early Triassic (Griesbachian).
The upper turbidite unit is Early Triassic (Griesbachian).The low amplitude, continuous reflection occurring just below the base of borehole 6611/09-U-01 is interpreted to represent top basement (Figures 3, 5)
The strong seismic reflection, which prior to drilling was interpreted to represent the top of the Permian, was later identified as the top of the anhydrite unit, an intra–Upper Permian reflectorThe top Permian reflector gives a weak negative acoustic impedance contrast and corresponds to a discontinuous seismic marker (Figure 3)
The top Permian reflector gives a weak negative acoustic impedance contrast and corresponds to a discontinuous seismic marker (Figure 3)As such, this is probably not a good seismic marker on the Trøndelag Platform because of the similar lithologies above and below the Permian– Triassic contact, that is, distal and lateral equivalents to the upper turbidite unitand thelowerturbiditeunit

Carbonate and evaporite clasts derived from the underlying Permian lithologies are also presentThe metamorphic clasts are similar to lithologies found on the Norwegian mainland.

The sandstone was probably derived from Late Devonian, Carboniferous, or Early Permian sandstones deposited in the present-day skerry zone east of the drill sites(b, c) Core photos from the 15 m– thick anhydrite unit, which is interpreted to represent sediments eroded from a sabhka environment and redeposited as gravity flow deposits
turbidite units represents the Permian–Triassic contact and is recognized in the cored succession by the development of coarsening-upward sandstones on top of the more fine grained sandy siltstones, which mark the uppermost part of the lower turbidite unit.The upper turbidite unit represents the lower 400 m of a greater than 5000 m–thick Triassic succession

As discussed in the following provenance section, this source could be Late Devonian– Early Permian sedimentary rocksThe red coloration of this unit decreases upward and may be associated with either increasing marine influence, decreasing reworked hematite due to a shift in source area, or a combination of these two effects.
In East Greenland, Late Devonian–Early Permian continental rocks are characterized by their reddish colorWe therefore suggest that similar Devonian–Early Permian sediments were the main source for the shallow-marinesandstone unit
We therefore suggest that similar Devonian–Early Permian sediments were the main source for the shallow-marinesandstone unitDipmeter data suggest that the sediments of the shallow-marine sandstone unit were sourced from the east, thus indicating that continental sand-prone sediments of Late Devonian–Early Permian age could have been deposited in the present skerry zone east of the drill sites
Dipmeter data suggest that the sediments of the shallow-marine sandstone unit were sourced from the east, thus indicating that continental sand-prone sediments of Late Devonian–Early Permian age could have been deposited in the present skerry zone east of the drill sitesThese sediments were probably deposited directly on Caledonian basement
Most of these sediments were eroded between the time of the middle Permian peneplanation and that of the relative lowering of sea level, when the anhydrite sediments overlying the Upper Permian sandstone were depositedAs a result, no traces of these sediments are found in the younger part of the cored succession.
The cored succession was analyzed for macrofaunaand palynomorphs, and in addition, the Permian section was analyzed for foraminiferaAmmonoids and bivalves were recorded throughout the Triassic section, except for the lowest 43 m
Ammonoids and bivalves were recorded throughout the Triassic section, except for the lowest 43 mForaminifera were found only in two samples in the upper 20 m of the Permian section
Foraminifera were found only in two samples in the upper 20 m of the Permian sectionPalynomorphs were recorded throughout the entire succession, except for the lowermost 90 m of the basal red sandstone
Diversity and preservation are best in the Triassic sectionKey fossils are shown in Figure 4.
The palynomorphs suggest a Late Permian (Ufimian–earliest Tatarian?) age for the lower 355 m of the cored successionThis comprises the shallowmarine sandstone unit, the anhydrite unit, and the lower turbidite unit
A further subdivision of the cored Upper Permian succession was not possible because of remarkably insignificant palynological variationsCorrelation with the East Greenland assemblages (Piasecki, 1984) suggests that there is a hiatus on top of the Permian succession and that at least the upper Tatarian is missing
Correlation with the East Greenland assemblages (Piasecki, 1984) suggests that there is a hiatus on top of the Permian succession and that at least the upper Tatarian is missingThe upper turbidite unit is assigned an Early Triassic (Griesbachian) age based on palynomorphdating
The upper turbidite unit is assigned an Early Triassic (Griesbachian) age based on palynomorphdatingThe ammonoids and bivalves indicate an early late Griesbachian age, but because they do not occur in the lowermost 43 m of the unit, we believe that this part may represent the early Griesbachian
If so, no hiatus exists within the Lower Triassic succession.The Permian palynoassemblages studied in the core material are very similar to those in the Upper Permian succession in East Greenland
The Permian palynoassemblages studied in the core material are very similar to those in the Upper Permian succession in East GreenlandThey are, however, different from those recorded on Svalbard, the Barents Sea, and the Sverdrup Basin in arctic Canada (Utting and Piasecki, 1995)
This similarity with East Greenland and the dissimilarity with the Arctic seem to have changed with the breakup of Pangea and an accompanying increased communication between these areas in the Early TriassicThe microflora in the Lower Triassic succession is strikingly similar to that recorded in all mentioned areas
The microflora in the Lower Triassic succession is strikingly similar to that recorded in all mentioned areasThis is also the case for the macrofauna, which appears very similar to the Early Triassic faunas recorded elsewhere in the Arctic area.
This is also the case for the macrofauna, which appears very similar to the Early Triassic faunas recorded elsewhere in the Arctic area.The only true potential source rock candidates in the cored succession are represented by two intervals of laminated mudstones in the upper part of the Upper Permian lower turbidite unit (450–470 m in Figure 4)
The only true potential source rock candidates in the cored succession are represented by two intervals of laminated mudstones in the upper part of the Upper Permian lower turbidite unit (450–470 m in Figure 4)The lower (13 m thick) and upper (6 m thick)mudstone intervals have average TOC contents of 3.2 and 3.5 wt
Rock-Eval Tmax values of 440–450C,coupled with mean vitrinite reflectance values of0.5–0.6 percent Ro, the generally yellow to brown kerogen color, and yellow-orange to medium orange sporinite fluorescence color would generally suggest an early oilwindow maturity for the Upper Permian sectionOccasional yellow to yellow-orange sporinite in Upper Permian rocks and green-yellow sporinite in some of the overlying Lower Triassic rocks, however, suggest a lower thermal maturity for the cored interval.
Occasional yellow to yellow-orange sporinite in Upper Permian rocks and green-yellow sporinite in some of the overlying Lower Triassic rocks, however, suggest a lower thermal maturity for the cored interval.Rock extracts of two samples from the upper laminated interval are relatively hydrocarbon rich, and the n-alkanes show rather smooth distributions and low wax content
Upper Permian siltstones (borehole 6611/09-U-01) are from the lower turbidite unit, oil staining from lower and upper turbidite unitsData for Ravnefjeld Formation, East
They are interbedded with three organic-lean, bioturbated siltstone units, similar to the cored succession from mid-Norway, and can be traced throughout the Upper Permian depositional basin of East Greenland (Christiansen et al., 1993).The Ravnefjeld Formation interfingers with carbonate buildups, and source rock quality varies depending on the local paleogeographic setting
The only source rock potential in the Lower Triassic upper turbidite unit is represented by several thin (typically 0.5–1.5 cm), more organic-rich layers of slightly brownish mudstone with TOC contents of up to 2.8 wt percent
Several intervals in the cored Permian and Triassic sandstones and siltstones are stained with light brown oil (Figure 8c)The visibly stained zones are typically 5–30 cm thick, and the distribution of the staining suggests that the oil followed horizontal zones that had the highest permeabilities within these otherwise poor reservoir rocks
A proper geochemical correlation between the oil staining in the sandstones and the bitumen in the cored organic-rich Upper Permian mudstonesispreventedby the partly nonindigenous origin of this bitumenThe geochemical signature of the oil staining, however, clearly contrasts with the terrestrially dominated kerogen composition in these mudstones at the coring sites.
When looking for alternative sources, a contribution from the widespread Upper Jurassic shales should not be completely ruled out on a purely geochemical basis, although oils from the Upper Jurassic on the mid-Norwegian shelf commonly show higher C30diahopane/hopane ratios than the Permian samples (Figure 14) and contain neither gammacerane nor prominent C28–C30 tricyclicsUpper Jurassic rocks are also unlikely to have been sufficiently deeply buried in areas adjacent to the coring sites
Upper Jurassic rocks are also unlikely to have been sufficiently deeply buried in areas adjacent to the coring sitesIn addition, the structural setting appears to preclude migration from the known Upper Jurassic source rocks into the drilled Upper Permian sandstones
In addition, the structural setting appears to preclude migration from the known Upper Jurassic source rocks into the drilled Upper Permian sandstonesMigration from either the Upper Permian section or the thick Triassic section to the west of the drill sites is more geologically conceivable.
Migration from either the Upper Permian section or the thick Triassic section to the west of the drill sites is more geologically conceivable.This narrows the alternatives for the source of the Helgeland oil staining down to either a more marine equivalent of the laminated Upper Permian mudstones or possibly a Lower Triassic source rock
This narrows the alternatives for the source of the Helgeland oil staining down to either a more marine equivalent of the laminated Upper Permian mudstones or possibly a Lower Triassic source rockApparently indigenous extracts from some of the thin, organicrich layers in the cored upper turbidite unit contain the abundant C21–C30 tricyclic diterpanes, low concentrations of C30 diahopane, and traces of gammacerane, which are so characteristic of the oil staining
Note that the isotopic composition of this Triassic rock extract is very similar to that of oil staining extracted from a sandstone core from exploration well Figure 12Terpane (m/z 191) mass fragmentogram of oil staining (SAT fraction), extracted from a sandstone, borehole 6611/09-U-01, lower turbidite unit
(1995) suggested, on the basis of the molecular (high wax, low vanadium/nickel [V/Ni], low sulfur [S], high hopane/sterane) and isotopic composition (d13Coil 32.2‰ PDB; d2Hoil 153‰ standard mean ocean water [SMOW]), that this staining was derived from a terrestrial source rock, possibly of Triassic or Paleozoic age.For Lower Triassic mudstones to be the source for the oil encountered in the shallow drilling would require a significant distal thickening of the thin (0.5–1.5 cm thick) layers of mudstone in the core
For Lower Triassic mudstones to be the source for the oil encountered in the shallow drilling would require a significant distal thickening of the thin (0.5–1.5 cm thick) layers of mudstone in the coreNo obvious proof exists for such a thickening, and there are no known Lower Triassic source rocks in East Greenland.
No obvious proof exists for such a thickening, and there are no known Lower Triassic source rocks in East Greenland.Therefore, because the oil staining shares some features with the rock extracts from the Ravnefjeld
Formation of East Greenland (e.g., high tricyclics, slight odd-dominance in homohopanes, similar carbon isotope composition), and despite the existing geochemical differences (e.g., gammacerane, C30 diahopane, diasteranes?), a more marine equivalent of the cored Upper Permian mudstones seems to be the most likely source for the oil staining.By the middle Permian, a seaway had opened between Greenland and Norway
By the middle Permian, a seaway had opened between Greenland and NorwayMarine sediments on East Greenland show that this seaway was open during the Late Permian and Early Triassic
Marine sediments on East Greenland show that this seaway was open during the Late Permian and Early TriassicExisting paleogeographic reconstructions suggest paleocoastlines some distance westward of the present Norwegian coastline (e.g., Ziegler, 1990; Dore´, 1991)
The Upper Permian Foldvik Creek Group is divided into five different formations (Figure 2) (Surlyk et al., 1986; Stemmerik, 1987) and is marine except for the lowermost part of the groupThe Lower Triassic is fully marine and comprises the Wordie Creek Formation (Perch-Nielsen et al., 1974)
The Lower Triassic is fully marine and comprises the Wordie Creek Formation (Perch-Nielsen et al., 1974)The shallow-marine sandstone unit described in this article comprises the lower 170 m of the cored succession and probably rests directly on Caledonian basement
The sediments show similarities with the Karstryggen Formation, which is the most widespread of the Upper Permian units in East GreenlandThe Karstryggen Formation is generally represented by limestones, with gypsum deposited under hypersaline conditions, resting either on the Huledal Formation or on pre–Upper Permian rocks (Stemmerik, 1987)
The Karstryggen Formation is generally represented by limestones, with gypsum deposited under hypersaline conditions, resting either on the Huledal Formation or on pre–Upper Permian rocks (Stemmerik, 1987)Stemmerik (1987) subdivided the Karstryggen Formation into four contrasting facies within a shallow-marine environment: shallow lagoonal, intertidal, high-energy setting, and a shallow subtidal high-energy setting
A relative shallowing throughout the latest Permian is represented by the overlying siltstone/fine-grained sandstone interval.The upper turbidite unit, which is characterized by massive and fining-upward sandy turbidites interbedded with laminated dark-gray siltstones, is correlated with the Wordie CreekFormationonEastGreenland
They are of similar age, Early Triassic(Griesbachian), and comprise turbidites deposited in a basinal slope setting
Marine conditions prevailed on the Trøndelag Platform on the mid-Norwegian shelf during the Late Permian–Early TriassicShallow stratigraphic drilling close to the coast of Norway cored a 750 m– thick succession resting on Caledonian crystalline basement
The lower part of the succession is dated as Upper Permian (Ufimian–lower Tatarian?) and the upper part as Lower Triassic (Griesbachian).The cored succession is similar to the succession ofthe same age outcropping onshore in East Greenland
This suggests that East Greenland and the mid-Norwegian shelf formed the western and eastern margins of the same sedimentary basin during the Late Permian–Early TriassicThe eastern boundary extended much farther east than previously assumed and probably coincided with the present coastline.
The most likely age of the provenance sandstone is Late Devonian– Early Permian.Two high-gamma, organic-rich intervals occur inthe upper part of the Permian succession
Two high-gamma, organic-rich intervals occur inthe upper part of the Permian successionThis clearly demonstrates that potential source rocks occur in the Upper Paleozoic succession on the midNorwegian shelf
This clearly demonstrates that potential source rocks occur in the Upper Paleozoic succession on the midNorwegian shelfThey have at best a moderate liquid hydrocarbon potential at the coring site but can be correlated with the oil-prone source rocks of the Ravnefjeld Formation of East Greenland
No possible migration route exists for hydrocarbons from the known Jurassic source rocks in the area into the Upper Permian sandstonesGeochemical correlation analyses allow no definite conclusion, but it is suggested that the oil was generated in Upper Permian mudstones or in basinal equivalents to the thin, organic-rich siltstone layers in the Lower Triassic succession.
