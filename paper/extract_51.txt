Chemical analyses of garnet-bearing metasediments and EMP and U/Pb analyses of detrital zircons of the Lula paragneisses in the Axial Zone of the Variscan belt (NE Sardinia) give significant contribution to the reconstruction of the early Paleozoic evolution of the northern Gondwana marginThe youngest middle Ordovician (465 Ma) age of detrital zircons indicate a derivation from a forearc sedimentary basin along an early Paleozoic convergent margin, which collected sediments from nearby emerged lands consisting of early Paleozoic volcanic arcs and pre-Paleozoic sequences

According to the suggestion of aViGad et alii (2012) for the Cabitza formation, on the basis of similar content of Cambrian and Neoproterozoic detrital zircons, a derivation of the Lula paragneiss from Pan-African terranes along the northern Gondwana margin can be proposed.Moreover, the occurrence of Greenvillian zircons in metasediments of the SW Sardinia early Paleozoic basement (i.e

Moreover, the occurrence of Greenvillian zircons in metasediments of the SW Sardinia early Paleozoic basement (i.eCabitza and Bithia formations) and the Lula paragneiss could indicate a contribution from the Sahara craton and/or the Arabian-Numidian shield (Fig

Similar deductions were also proposed for the Calabria–Peloritani Terrane of Southern Italy, where some pre-Cambrian sediments derive from East and West African sources and the Ordovician sediments reflect erosion of Pan-African orogen and local input from Grenvillian terrains (Fornelli et alii, 2016).The geochemical data and U–Pb analyses of zircon of some samples of Lula paragneiss from tectonic domains in the axial zone of Variscan belt in northern Sardinia,

The source rocks of the Lula paragneiss derive from an early-Paleozoic sedimentary basin which collected sediments from the nearby pre-Paleozoic sequences and early Paleozoic volcanic arc.The deposition age of the sedimentary protolith, similar to the emplacement age of Lodé orthogneiss, indicates that the Lula paragneiss derives from a forearc basin in an Ordovician active convergent margin (Andean-type or subduction-accretion margin)

This suggestion contradicts previous interpretation of the Lula paragneiss as host rock of the Lodé orthogneiss and highlights the role of Variscan tectonics in the assembly of different blocks deriving from the earlymiddle Paleozoic margin.The REE pattern of the paragneiss, with LREE enrichment, negative Eu-anomaly and flat HREE, suggests a derivation from an old upper continental crust mainly made up of felsic rocks

This fits well with similar proposed derivation of early Paleozoic metasedimentary formations in southern Sardinia and northern Apennine, pointing out a common location of these sedimentary basins along the northern margin of Gondwana at the early Paleozoic times.We are grateful to one anonymous reviewer and to Annamaria Fornelli who helped to improve the original manuscript
