These units contain stratigraphic sequences made of Mesozoic evaporitic and carbonate deposits covered by Oligocene to Miocene turbidite deposits, which are progressively younger toward the northeastThe main turbitidic successions are known as the upper Oligocene to lower Miocene Macigno (Tuscan Unit), the lower Miocene Modino sandstone (Modino Unit), the lowermiddle Miocene Cervarola sandstone (Cervarola Unit), and the middle-upper Miocene Marnoso-Arenacea Formation (UmbriaMarche Domain).
The main turbitidic successions are known as the upper Oligocene to lower Miocene Macigno (Tuscan Unit), the lower Miocene Modino sandstone (Modino Unit), the lowermiddle Miocene Cervarola sandstone (Cervarola Unit), and the middle-upper Miocene Marnoso-Arenacea Formation (UmbriaMarche Domain).The study area represents the core of the Modena-Bologna segment of the Northern Apennines fold and thrust belt in which the Cervarola Unit outcrops
This structural unit contains two turbidite successions tectonically stacked on top of each other and traditionally known as the Cervarola sandstones (Burdigalian) and the Granaglione sandstones (Langhian)After the thrusting of the Cervarola sandstones over the Granaglione sandstones in post-Langhian times, four thrust sheets developed deforming the latter turbiditic succession
After the thrusting of the Cervarola sandstones over the Granaglione sandstones in post-Langhian times, four thrust sheets developed deforming the latter turbiditic successionThe geometrical relationship between the Cervarola and Granaglione sandstones is shown in Figure 2.
Present day reconstructed geometrical relationships between the Cervarola and the Granaglione sandstones outcropping in the studyzone and the surrounding areas on the metamorphic grade of the studied successions come from organic matter maturity and clay mineralogy
(2004) on the integrated use of both organic matter maturity and clay mineralogy reconstructed the burial history of the Cervarola and Granaglione sandstones and their tectonic evolution since Aquitanian timesA calculated tectonic loading of 3.5 km and of ∼5.0 km on the Cervarola and Granaglione sandstones, respectively, has been indicated as the main factor responsible for the acquired thermal maturity of the studied area
