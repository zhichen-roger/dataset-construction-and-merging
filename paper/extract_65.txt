The trail of late Paleozoic eolian sandstones ranges from Lower Pennsylvanian (Atokan) in the Grand Canyon (Manacacha Formation) through Middle and Upper Pennsylvanian across much of the Western Interior (Hermosa, Weber, Casper, Wescogame, etc., Formations), through Permian (Weber, Cedar Mesa, Esplanade, etc., Formations)Consistent northeasterly winds transported sand southwestward throughout the late Paleozoic (Peterson, 1988).

Consistent northeasterly winds transported sand southwestward throughout the late Paleozoic (Peterson, 1988).Given that Grand Canyon strata contain abundant detrital zircons that are interpreted to have been shed from the southern and central Appalachian orogen, it is tempting to interpret the age distributions of these units as a possible record of magmatism in the Appalachian orogen
