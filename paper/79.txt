The purpose of this comparison is to assess the homogeneity and provenance of detritus because quartz-rich sandstones of both formations are coeval having Burdigalian p.p- Early Langhian age
- Early Langhian ageThe depositional domain of the Bifurto formation was located on the sinking Campania-Lucania carbonate platform whereas that of Numidian Flysch was within the Lagonegro-Molise Basin east of the Campania-Lucania Platform
These ages suggest a provenance area consisting of ancient orogens in which Precambrian and Silurian rocks are presentThe absence of Paleozoic - Mesozoic ages excludes provenance from Variscan or Alpine rocks
The absence of Paleozoic - Mesozoic ages excludes provenance from Variscan or Alpine rocksOn this basis, the African Craton represents the exclusive source area of Bifurto sandstones as well as of Numidian Flysch sandstones outcropping in Southern Apennines

age of this depositional event spans from Early Miocene in the western Mediterranean area to Early Langhian in the north-eastern sector of the Southern Apennines (e.gwezel, 1967, GuerrerA et alii, 1993, 2005; lentini et alii, 2002; de cApoA et alii, 2003; perrone et alii, 2008; BonArdi et alii, 2009; pinter et alii, 2016).
In the Southern Apennines the depositional domains of the Numidian quartz-rich sandstones were represented by Early Miocene foreland depocenters located on the westward subducting Adriatic-Ionian lithosphere represented by the Campania-Lucania Platform to the west and the LagonegroMolise Basin to the east (Fig2).
The origin of Numidian detritus represents a key element in the reconstruction of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic paleogeographic and tectono-sedimentary evolution in the Mediterranean area, which can be tackled by zircon U-Pb dating (GAllowAy et alii, 2011; thomAS, 2011; vermeeSch, 2012; mAluSà et alii, 2016b; zhAnG et alii, 2016)Zircon is the most widely used mineral for its greater thermal stability indicating the last high temperature metamorphic event involving the source rock and/or the age of system closure in magmatic rocks
(B) Paleogeographic reconstruction (not in scale) of sedimentary basins in Southern Apennines from west to east in Burdigalian - Langhian timesThe sedimentary domain of Bifurto
The focus was placed on Early Miocene quartz-rich sandstones of Bifurto and Flysch Numidico formations (Selli, 1957; oGniBen, 1969) parts of different tectonic units, detached from their paleogeographic domains on the western margin of Adriatic Plate and tectonically embricated on the Apenninic accretionary wedgeThese formations are considered as correlatable lithostratigraphic units, representative of the foreland domains of the Apenninic orogenic system in the Late Burdigalian - Early Langhian (e.g

In particular, the formation lies on Lower Miocene calcareous ramp deposits (Cerchiara Formation, perrone, 1981; SGroSSo, 1981; cAmmAroSAno et alii, 2011) and passes upward to the immature siliciclastic Civita sandstones (Fig3).
The Numidian Flysch belongs to the Sannio and Tufillo-Serra Palazzo tectonic units (sensu pAtAccA & ScAndone, 2007) and characterizes the upper portion of the Cretaceous - Miocene sedimentary succession of the Lagonegro-Molise Basin and crops out along the external wedge of the chain from Lucania to Molise regionsThe Numidian Flysch is stratigraphically rooted (Fig

751 Ma), fourteen Ediacaran ages (702-544 Ma), three Cambrian ages (534-494 Ma) and two Ordovician-Silurian ages (450-425 Ma).Twenty-nine zircons were investigated in the sample FNP2, giving twenty-eight concordant ages ranging from 2551±40 Ma to 543±14 Ma (zrns 30, 11 in Fig
Six Paleoproterozoic ages (2551-1790 Ma), seven Neo-proterozoic (Tonian-Cryogenian) ages (1017-717 Ma), fifteen Ediacaran ages (646-543 Ma); Ordovician and Silurian ages are missing in this sample (Fig7).
The detected younger ages (450-425 Ma) in sample FNF1 are interpreted as evidences of Ordovician-Silurian signatures in the source rocksHercynian and/or Alpine ages are lacking in both samples (Fig
The quartz-rich sandstones of Bifurto Formation having Late Burdigalian - Early Langhian age (e.gpAtAccA & ScAndone, 2007) rest stratigraphically on the Campania-Lucania Platform, whereas the typical and coeval Numidian Flysch arenites were deposited in the Lagonegro-Molise Basin, at east of the paleogeographic domain of Bifurto sandstones (Fig
These ages represent a further contribution of Proterozoic and Silurian detrital zircons to Bifurto sandstones, not reported in the Numidian Flysch.The ages of detrital zircons are decisive to distinguish the detritus provenance in the sedimentary sequences forming the Apenninic system derived from Cenozoic tectonism
The ages of detrital zircons are decisive to distinguish the detritus provenance in the sedimentary sequences forming the Apenninic system derived from Cenozoic tectonismThe Cretaceous-Paleogene Alpine Chain localized in western and northern areas records signatures of older orogens located on African or European plates (Fig

An exclusive derivation of detritus from the African Craton, implies pre-Silurian ages of detrital zircons, being the African basement formed by ancient igneous and metamorphic rocksIn contrast, Paleozoic-Mesozoic detrital zircon ages together with older zircon ages could indicate a provenance of detritus from the Alpine orogenic systems in which Pre-Cambrian, Cambrian and Paleozoic-Mesozoic zircon ages are common

550-450 Ma, relative to the Cadomian-Panafrican magmatism) and to Carboniferous - Permian (i.e350-250 Ma, Hercynian ages) are found
During the formation of Cretaceous-Paleogene Alpine Chain, the Hercynian orogen remained on the European Plate and was inserted to this same plateConsequently, the European and African plates can provide Cadomian-Pan-African and older zircons, whereas only the European Plate can supply Hercynian or Alpine zircons in the Cenozoic sedimentary basins.
Consequently, the European and African plates can provide Cadomian-Pan-African and older zircons, whereas only the European Plate can supply Hercynian or Alpine zircons in the Cenozoic sedimentary basins.The age data collected on Bifurto sandstones reveal a continuum range of zircon ages from 2430 Ma to 425 Ma in sample FNF1 and from 2551 Ma to 543 Ma in sample FNP2 (Figs
Successively, the Paleozoic geodynamic cycle started with the injection of felsic dykes at 470 and 400 MaIn the quartz-rich sandstones of Numidian Flysch and Bifurto Formation, signatures relative to older stages (1, 2 and 3) are present, in Bifurto sandstones even stage 4 and initial phase of Paleozoic geodynamism are testified by detrital zircon ages (Fig
In the quartz-rich sandstones of Numidian Flysch and Bifurto Formation, signatures relative to older stages (1, 2 and 3) are present, in Bifurto sandstones even stage 4 and initial phase of Paleozoic geodynamism are testified by detrital zircon ages (Fig11)
Detrital zircon ages from Bifurto sandstones evidenced the presence of abundant zircons with ages ranging from Archean to Silurian and show the complete absence of Hercynian (350-280 Ma) and Alpine (100-40 Ma) zircon agesThe ages of detrital zircons of Bifurto (2551-603 Ma) are comparable (Fig
Consequently, an analogous source area extending from the Atlantic coast to the Hoggar and Tibesti Massifs, in which Archean, Paleo-proterozoic and CadomianPanafrican rocks are widely diffused, can be suggested(thomAS et alii, 2010a; 2010b; GuerrerA et alii, 2012)
At last, it must be outlined that some Authors (Fornelli & piccArretA, 1997; Fornelli, 1998; d’errico et alii, 2014) interpreted the presence of sub-arkose samples in Numidian Flysch successions from Southern Apennine with angular- sub-angular and deformed quartz grains as evidence of partial input from rock types forming the Alpine Chain in which ages ranging from Hercynian (350280 Ma) to Paleogene p.p(100-40 Ma) are measured
