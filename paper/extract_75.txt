Based on detrital zircon U–Pb and Lu–Hf data from Permian Vryheid Formation sandstones of the main Karoo basin in eastern South Africa, Veevers & Saeed (2007) suggested that detritus was transported from primary sources in central Antarctica to depositional basins in present-day southern Africa and adjacent parts of the Gondwana supercontinent in late Palaeozoic time.

These rocks thus hold a potential key role for the understanding of the detrital zircon budget of Phanerozoic sedimentary sequences in SW Gondwana: if significant amounts of material from central Antarctica were transported to southern Africa in Permian time, detrital zircon in the older Natal Group should show age and Hf isotope characteristics significantly different from that of the Vryheid Formation sandstones

The detrital zircon age and Hf isotope distribution patterns in Figures 3–5 suggest that three main detrital zircon components are present in the rocks of the Natal Group: (1) Palaeo- to Meosarchaean; (2) Mesoproterozoic to earliest Neoproterozoic; (3) Neoproterozoic; with characteristic εHf ranges of +3 to –8, +11 to –13 and +10 to –11, respectively

In addition to its dominant Archaean population the Ulundi matrix sample (SA12/29) also contains three, near-concordant, middle Mesoproterozoic to earliest Neoproterozoic zircon grains, which could be derived from the Natal Sector of the Namaqua–Natal Province where similar ages are recorded (e.g

Their interpretation was that these sediments were derived from a common source in central Antarctica, which shed detritus to surrounding parts of Gondwana in the late Palaeozoic; and they inferred from Cambrian (meta)sediments with similar zircon signatures from the Welch Mountains, Antarctica and the Ellsworth–Whitmore Mountains that the same central Antarctica source was also active in the Cambrian period

However, apart from the Karoo, Dronning Maud Land, Welch Mountains and the Ellsworth–Whitmore Mountains, similar detrital zircon signatures have been reported from sedimentary rocks in many parts of former Gondwana and over a range of depositional ages from Neoproterozoic to Permian, including southern Africa (Fourie et al

This suggests either (1) that there has been a source feeding this vast area at least from Neoproterozoic to Permian time, (2) that these deposits are the result of recycling of older sedimentary sequences (the signatures thereby being a manifestation of the inherent resilience of zircon to physical and chemical weathering), or (3) that the various areas of Gondwana that fed these sandstone sequences are not sufficiently distinctive for them to be distinguished from age and Hf isotope data

Combined with the results of sedimentary sequences with similar detrital zircon patterns our results show that sedimentary sequences dominated by juvenile Mesoproterozoic zircon and Neoproterozoic zircon derived from juvenile, Mesoproterozoic material reworked during the Pan-African Orogeny are a common feature of neighbouring areas of former southern Gondwana

Thus the Permian Karoo and Dronning Maud Land sandstones of Veevers & Saeed (2007) need not be derived from Central Antarctica (similar signatures were abundant in adjacent areas from at least the Neoproterozoic) but could be the result of recycling, or could be derived from one of several (equally) likely source terranes.
