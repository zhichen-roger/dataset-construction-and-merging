Based on data obtained in this study and by others, the main conclusions are as follows: 1) Low-grade metamorphic sedimentary rocks are distributed extensively in the south of the Lungmuco-Shuanghu Suture and are Phanerozoic in age; 2) Pan-African and Grenville-Jinning tectono-thermal events were well developed in the source region of the Wenquan quartzite; 3) the source region shows crustal addition and recycling of different periods; 4) Wenquan quartzite was derived from the Gondwana metamorphic basement, suggesting that the Qiangtang block is a Gondwanan fragment.Gondwana, Tibetan Plateau, detrital zircon, SHRIMP dating, Hf isotope, Pan-African movement, Grenville-Jinning movement
