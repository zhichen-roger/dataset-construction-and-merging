ABSTRACT: The shallow marine Lower Jurassic quartz arenites of the Stø Formation in the southern Barents Sea comprise (1) intervals where dispersed detrital clay is absent, and where the spacing between clay-rich laminae that evolved into stylolites upon burial is exceptionally large, up to several meters, and (2) intervals where minor detrital clay matrix occurs, clay laminae are very common, and stylolite spacing is typically less than a centimeterPoint counting of thin sections and cathodoluminescence micrographs shows that quartz cement contents are far lower in the intervals where stylolite spacing is exceptionally large, 4–11 percent, versus 10–20 percent outside these intervals

The incomplete Upper Cretaceous stratigraphy suggests that erosional events may also have occurred during this periodThe Stø Formation is presently overlain by Oxfordian shales deposited in an offshore setting, and conformably overlies the interbedded lower-delta-plain sandstones, siltstones, and shales of the Lower Jurassic Nordmela Formation.
