Cenozoic collapse of the eastern Uinta Mountains and drainage evolution of the Uinta Mountains regionAndres Aslan1, Marisa Boraas-Connors2, Douglas A
Coupled detrital sanidine and zircon data, combined with sedimentological and stratigraphic observations, provide temporal constraints on the post-Laramide paleogeographic and structural evolution of the eastern Uinta Mountains region from the late Eocene to late Miocene (ca36–8 Ma)
Maximum depositional ages (MDAs) calculated from detrital zircon U-Pb and  detrital sanidine 40Ar/39Ar ages indicate that the most significant Paleogene fluvial system in the region, represented by the Bishop Conglomerate, e xisted from 36 to 27 MaThe abundance of red sandstone and gray limestone clasts, paleocurrent directions, and the large number of Grenville-age detrital zircons suggest that the Uinta Mountain Group (UMG) facies of the Bishop Conglomerate are tributaries that flowed radially away from the crest of the Uinta Mountains
New MDAs of Browns Park Formation sediments that unconformably overlie Neoproterozoic UMG rocks in westernmost Browns Park provide evidence for a younger (12–8 Ma) phase of extensional collapse of the eastern Uinta Mountains that was associated with 10–20 km of northwestward-directed lengthening of the Browns Park grabenThese data are compatible with models for two stages of post-Laramide epeirogenic uplift of the Uinta Mountains region, including post–12 Ma tectonism that set the stage for subsequent integration of the Green and Colorado Rivers after 8 Ma.
The northern boundary of the Colorado Plateau physiographic province (western USA) is the Precambrian-cored east-west–trending Uinta Mountains uplift that formed in the Laramide orogeny, ca70–50 Ma (Hansen, 1984, 1986; Bradley, 1995) (Fig
Like the Kaibab uplift and Grand Canyon to the south, this uplift is a key physiographic barrier for understanding Cenozoic drainage evolution of the Colorado PlateauPowell (1876) found it enigmatic that the Green River cut a deep gorge (Canyon of Lodore) orthogonal to the Uinta Mountains uplift, and postulated that the river course predated the uplift (antecedence)
Since then, studies of the integration of the Green River and Colorado River systems have entertained more complex histories involving landscapes where modern river courses reflect linkage of internally drained basins and modification of paleoriver segments through a combination of piracy and downward integration (Blackwelder, 1934; Lucchitta, 1972; Pederson and Hadder, 2005; Aslan et al., 2014; Karlstrom et al., 2014; Kimbrough et al., 2015) coupled with Cenozoic uplift (Karlstrom et al., 2012).Reconstructing Cenozoic landscapes is commonly hampered by imprecise chronologies that rely on techniques such as paleomagnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphic correlation to land-mammal ages, and where available, radiometric dating of volcanic deposits
Reconstructing Cenozoic landscapes is commonly hampered by imprecise chronologies that rely on techniques such as paleomagnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphic correlation to land-mammal ages, and where available, radiometric dating of volcanic depositsThe application of detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology has provided another tool to constrain the ages of terrestrial clastic deposits (e.g., Stewart et al., 2001; Hodges et al., 2005; Gehrels et al., 2011; Fan et al., 2015), and newly emerging techniques such as detrital sanidine 40Ar/39Ar geochronology offer potentially even more precise means for establishing temporal frameworks for interpreting the provenance of terrestrial sediments and landscape evolution (Hereford et al., 2016; Karlstrom et al., 2017)
Within the western United States, Laramide intermontane basins are important archives of Cenozoic landscape evolution (Lilligraven and Ostresh, 1988; Smith et al., 2003, 2008; McMillan et al., 2006), and these detrital dating techniques provide excellent opportunities to improve our understanding of paleogeography.The Cenozoic geologic history of southwestern Wyoming, northeastern Utah, and northwestern Colorado (Fig
The Cenozoic geologic history of southwestern Wyoming, northeastern Utah, and northwestern Colorado (Fig1) provides the framework for studying the evolution of the upper Green River system beginning with Lakes Gosiute and Uinta during the Eocene (Bradley, 1936; Hansen, 1969a, 1969b, 1984, 1986; Smith et al., 2008) (Fig
1) provides the framework for studying the evolution of the upper Green River system beginning with Lakes Gosiute and Uinta during the Eocene (Bradley, 1936; Hansen, 1969a, 1969b, 1984, 1986; Smith et al., 2008) (Fig2A)
As shown in Figure 2B, Hansen (1986) suggested that the Eocene lakes were replaced by an Oligocene eastward-flowing river system (ancestral Platte River) originating in the mountains of southwestern Wyoming and northeastern UtahIn this model, subsequent Miocene collapse
In this model, subsequent Miocene collapseof the eastern Uinta Mountains and the formation of the Browns Park graben set the stage for drainage reorganization and capture of the ancestral eastward-flowing Platte River (Fig
Details of the transition from Eocene lakes to the modern Green River system, however, remain poorly understoodIn particular, the ages of key Cenozoic deposits, the pathways of ancient rivers, and the precise timing of the collapse of the eastern Uinta Mountains remain poorly constrained (Hansen, 1986; Pederson and Hadder, 2005).
In particular, the ages of key Cenozoic deposits, the pathways of ancient rivers, and the precise timing of the collapse of the eastern Uinta Mountains remain poorly constrained (Hansen, 1986; Pederson and Hadder, 2005).The purpose of this paper is to integrate sedimentologic and stratigraphic observations, provenance information, and age constraints provided by new detrital zircon and sanidine data to improve our understanding of Cenozoic landscape evolution in the Uinta Mountains region
The purpose of this paper is to integrate sedimentologic and stratigraphic observations, provenance information, and age constraints provided by new detrital zircon and sanidine data to improve our understanding of Cenozoic landscape evolution in the Uinta Mountains regionSpecifically, this study (1) provides new constraints on the timing of extensional collapse of the eastern Uinta Mountains, which set the stage for final integration of the Green River across the Uinta Mountains, (2) examines the Cenozoic fluvial record of the Uinta Mountains region and questions the interpretation of a late Eocene to Oligocene eastward-flowing ancestral Platte River system, and (3) highlights the prevalence of far-transported Oligocene–Miocene ash-fall grains and sediment reworking in the Bishop Conglomerate and Browns Park Formation, which has important implications for using detrital zircon and sanidine data for interpreting the provenance and depositional ages of clastic sediments that have accumulated during times of extensive volcanic activity.

Late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic Laramide tectonism in southwestern Wyoming, northeastern Utah, and northwestern Colorado created uplifts in the study area, including the east-west–trending Uinta Mountains and the northsouth–trending Rock Springs uplift (Fig1)
North of the Uinta Mountains and west of the Rock Springs uplift, Eocene basin fill, including the Green River and Bridger Formations, accumulated in the southern Green River Basin (Bridger Basin) until ca47 Ma (Murphey and Evanoff, 2007; Smith et al., 2008) (Fig
South of the Uinta Mountains, Eocene sedimentary rocks represented by the Green River, Uinta, and Duchesne River Formations, filled the Uinta Basin until at least ca40 Ma (Mauger, 1977; Bryant et al., 1989; Prothero and Swisher, 1992; Sprinkel, 2015)
Eocene deposits (Green River and Bridger Formations) filled the Washakie and Sand Wash Basins to the east and southeast of the Rock Springs uplift, respectively, until ca46–45 Ma (Smith et al., 2008).
A regional unconformity separates Eocene and older Laramide basin fill from younger units in Browns Park and the Green River and Uinta Basins (Fig3A)
This surface bevels rocks from the core of the Uinta Mountains (Neoproterozoic Uinta Mountain Group) to lower Paleogene units in the surrounding Laramide basinsIn northeastern Utah, southwestern  Wyoming, and parts of northwestern Colorado, this surface is overlain by the upper Eocene–Oligocene Bishop Conglomerate
In northeastern Utah, southwestern  Wyoming, and parts of northwestern Colorado, this surface is overlain by the upper Eocene–Oligocene Bishop ConglomerateIn some parts of northwestern Colorado, the erosion surface is overlain by the upper Oligocene–Miocene Browns Park Formation (Hansen, 1986; Buffler, 2003)
In some parts of northwestern Colorado, the erosion surface is overlain by the upper Oligocene–Miocene Browns Park Formation (Hansen, 1986; Buffler, 2003)Prior studies show that the Browns Park Formation locally overlies the Bishop Conglomerate along the eastern flank of the Uinta Mountains (Hansen, 1986).
The upper Eocene–Oligocene Bishop Conglomerate was first described by Powell (1876) and studied in detail by Bradley (1936) and Hansen (1984, 1986)The unit consists predominantly of fluvial sandy conglomerate, tuffaceous conglomeratic sandstone, and lesser amounts of tuffaceous mudrock that fill paleovalleys in northeastern Utah, southwestern Wyoming, and northwestern Colorado
Strata are typically flat lying, tens of meters to a few hundred meters thick, and unconformably overlie gently dipping Precambrian through early Paleogene rocks in both the Uinta and Green River BasinsThe sediment source of the Bishop Conglomerate is interpreted to be primarily from the Uinta Mountains, because the deposits thin and clast sizes decrease radially away from the range front (Bradley, 1936; Hansen, 1986)
Compositionally, clasts are dominated by red sandstones of the Neoproterozoic Uinta Mountain Group, and Paleozoic limestones and sandstones (Hansen, 1986)Bradley (1936) and Hansen (1986) interpreted the Bishop Conglomerate to represent a time of alluvial sedimentation associated with tectonic quiescence and climatic change from hot and moist conditions in the Eocene to cooler and drier conditions during the Oligocene
Bradley (1936) and Hansen (1986) interpreted the Bishop Conglomerate to represent a time of alluvial sedimentation associated with tectonic quiescence and climatic change from hot and moist conditions in the Eocene to cooler and drier conditions during the OligoceneThe age of the Bishop Conglomerate is constrained by 40Ar/39Ar ages (ca
The upper Oligocene–Miocene Browns Park Formation was also first described by Powell (1876) and was studied in detail by Buffler (1967, 2003), Izett (1975), Hansen (1984, 1986), and Luft (1985) in northwestern Colorado and northeastern UtahThe Browns Park Formation contains tuffaceous sandstone and mudrock with minor amounts of limestone that represent a mosaic of fluvial, la cus trine, and eolian environments (Izett, 1975; Luft, 1985; Hansen, 1986; Buffler, 2003)

This unit unconformably overlies Eocene and older units in these areasThe majority of the outcrops are represented by poorly consolidated conglomeratic sandstone and sandy conglomerate with boulder- to pebble-sized clasts dominated by red sandstone and light gray limestone and sandstone derived from the Uinta Mountains, similar to the composition of the extensive outcrops of Bishop Conglomerate on the south flanks of the Uinta Mountains (Hansen, 1986; Kowallis et al., 2005)
the Neoproterozoic Uinta Mountain Group (UMG) and light gray limestones and sandstones are derived from Paleozoic carbonates and siliciclastic units.We identified and described three facies that compose the Bishop Conglomerate: (1) UMG facies, (2) Firehole Canyon (FC) facies, and (3) sandy facies
Overall, this facies represents a series of lenses of northward-thinning coarse-grained wedges that unconformably overlie Late Cretaceous–Eocene rocks of the Green River Basin and the adjacent Rock Springs uplift (Fig5A)
Similar to the UMG facies, FC facies strata unconformably overlie Late Cretaceous–Eocene rocksThe best exposures of the FC facies are at Firehole Canyon, the saddle between Miller and Aspen Mountains, and on the bluffs south of Green River, Wyoming
These beds overlie Neoproterozoic through Eocene bedrock and although poorly exposed, superficially resemble tuffaceous sedimentary rocks of the Browns Park Formation located ~10 km northeast in Browns ParkThe sandy facies is also associated with classic outcrops of the Bishop Conglomerate on the Diamond Plateau near Vernal, Utah.
Elsewhere, near the western margin of Browns Park, Browns Park strata are relatively flat lying, and onlap gently dipping Neoproterozoic UMG sandstonesZircon fission track ages from tuffaceous material indicate that the Browns Park Formation accumulated from ca
While A rchean (2700–2600 Ma), Paleoproterozoic (1850–1750 Ma), Mesoproterozoic (ca1450 Ma) and Grenville orogeny (1200–1000 Ma) detrital zircon U-Pb ages are well represented in both facies, detrital zircon grains of Grenville orogeny age are more abundant (39 percent of the grains analyzed) in the UMG  facies compared to the FC facies sample
Another noteworthy difference is the  Archean grain ages (Figs7A, 7B)
The FC facies sample also has Early Cretaceous (107–90 Ma) detrital zircon grains that are absent from the UMG facies sample (Fig6B)

Detrital zircon and sanidine MDAs of the Bishop Conglomerate confirm that this unit is late Eocene–early Oligocene (Fig9; Table 1)
Detrital zircon and detrital sanidine MDAs of the Browns Park Formation confirm that the unit is late Oligocene to Miocene (ca25–8 Ma) (Izett, 1975; Luft, 1985), and suggest that the youngest sediments of the graben fill are concentrated in westernmost Browns Park along the Colorado-Utah border (Fig
The Taylor Flat sample is from a small remnant of the Browns Park Formation (elevation 1865 m) that is preserved beneath erosionally resistant river gravel of the ancestral Green River (Counts, 2005), and the sample is from a tuffaceous siltstone that overlies the Neoproterozoic Uinta Mountain GroupThis remnant is significantly higher in elevation than any nearby Browns Park Formation outcrop, and probably represents the best estimate for the minimum age (8.4 ± 0.3 Ma) of the Browns Park Formation in the region.
36–27 Ma) represented by the Bishop Conglomerate, there were no nearby late Eocene–Oligocene outcrops to explain the abundant younger than 40 Ma detrital zircon and sanidine grains (Love and Christiansen, 1985)The youngest bedrock unit in the region was probably the Eocene Bridger Formation, which has a minimum age of ca
The youngest bedrock unit in the region was probably the Eocene Bridger Formation, which has a minimum age of ca47 Ma (Murphey and Evanoff, 2007)
It is also unlikely that grains of this young (younger than 40 Ma) age were transported by rivers draining hinterlands composed of Oligocene and younger rocks, and deposited subsequently in southwestern Wyoming and northwestern ColoradoRocks of this age are abundant in the southern Basin and Range, but barriers such as the Wyoming fold and thrust belt (Fig
Instead, the younger than 40 Ma detrital zircon and sanidine grains in the Bishop Conglomerate and Browns Park Formation probably represent a combination of Oligocene through Miocene volcanism, ash-fall deposition, and subsequent fluvial reworkingThis interpretation is supported by a combination of stratigraphic observations and age estimates of Cenozoic volcanic activity in the western U.S.
This interpretation is supported by a combination of stratigraphic observations and age estimates of Cenozoic volcanic activity in the western U.S.Figure 8 (samples A, B, D, E, G) shows that for a composite stratigraphic succession of the Bishop Conglomerate and Browns Park Formation det rital zircon samples, the age of the youngest U-Pb age distributions decrease systematically at successively younger stratigraphic levels
This interpretation is further supported by comparing the timing of Cenozoic ignimbrite events with the general ages of the young detrital grains.Figure 11 compares the timing and volume of Oligocene and Miocene ignimbrites (Perkins et al., 1998; Cather et al., 2009; Best et al., 2013; Lipman and Bachmann, 2015) with detrital zircon data for the Browns Park Formation and the Bishop Conglomerate
Figure 11 compares the timing and volume of Oligocene and Miocene ignimbrites (Perkins et al., 1998; Cather et al., 2009; Best et al., 2013; Lipman and Bachmann, 2015) with detrital zircon data for the Browns Park Formation and the Bishop ConglomerateThere is a good correspondence between the timing of the Cenozoic ignimbrite flux for western North America and the ages of the dominant detrital zircon age distributions in the Bishop Conglomerate, and to a lesser extent, in the Browns Park Formation (Fig
There is a good correspondence between the timing of the Cenozoic ignimbrite flux for western North America and the ages of the dominant detrital zircon age distributions in the Bishop Conglomerate, and to a lesser extent, in the Browns Park Formation (Fig11A)
Prior studies have proposed that Oligocene–Miocene volcanism played a significant role in the accumulation of fine-grained Cenozoic units in the western U.Sbased on a combination of radiometric dating, analysis of volcanic glass chemistry, and detrital zircon studies (Blaylock, 1998; Larson and Evanoff, 1998; Fan et al., 2015; Rowley and Fan, 2016)
Larson and Evanoff (1998) used radiometric ages to broadly correlate Oligocene White River Formation tuffs located in eastern Wyoming and western Nebraska with Basin and Range volcanismBlaylock (1998) refined tephra correlations of Larson and Evanoff (1998) using detailed geochemical analyses of comagmatic minerals, but also concluded that the southern Basin and Range was the source of several White River Formation tephra units
(2015) used overall similarities in the timing of Oligocene volcanism and MDAs of detrital zircon samples to explain the abundance of Oligocene detrital zircon grains in tuffaceous fluvial deposits in Wyoming and NebraskaThis study suggested, however, that the Sierra Madre Occidental volcanic field in Mexico may have been
the source for the Oligocene detrital zircon grainsFigure 13 summarizes our new interpretations of Oligocene–Miocene ash-fall deposition based on the data and discussion presented in this study
Figure 13 summarizes our new interpretations of Oligocene–Miocene ash-fall deposition based on the data and discussion presented in this studyIn summary, far-traveled tephra that mantled the landscapes of southwestern Wyoming, northeastern Utah, and northwestern Colorado during the latest Eocene through Miocene was reworked subsequently into Bishop and Browns Park depositional systems.
In summary, far-traveled tephra that mantled the landscapes of southwestern Wyoming, northeastern Utah, and northwestern Colorado during the latest Eocene through Miocene was reworked subsequently into Bishop and Browns Park depositional systems.Repetition of this sequence of events produced deposits with successively younger detrital zircon grains, and further suggests that MDAs for the Bishop Conglomerate and Browns Park Formation are close to true depositional ages, as has been suggested for other Cenozoic units in the western U.S
Repetition of this sequence of events produced deposits with successively younger detrital zircon grains, and further suggests that MDAs for the Bishop Conglomerate and Browns Park Formation are close to true depositional ages, as has been suggested for other Cenozoic units in the western U.Sthat accumulated in regions of semicontinuous ignimbrite volcanism (Fan et al., 2015; Rowley and Fan, 2016).
Differences in the distribution, paleocurrents, and composition of the Bishop Conglomerate UMG and FC facies suggest that these deposits represent tributaries and a mainstem river, respectively, of a latest Eocene to early Oligocene fluvial systemPrevious investigators have shown that the Bishop Conglomerate (UMG facies) represents a series of rivers that drained radially away from the Uinta Mountains (Bradley, 1936; Hansen, 1986)
The abundance of reddish sandstone clasts and Grenville-age grains in the UMG facies confirms that the provenance was the Neoproterozoic UMG in the nearby Uinta MountainsNew numerical age constraints show that this river system flowed along the north flank of the Uinta Mountains ca
This observation could indicate that the mainstem river flowed to the west, but this interpretation assumes that there has been no significant post-Oligocene deformation of the FC facies conglomerates.The presence of volcanic clasts and the abundance of rounded quartzite cobbles in the FC facies clearly show that the provenance of this facies differs from the UMG facies
Possible sources of the quartzite clasts in the FC facies include Proterozoic quartzite in the Sierra Madre Mountains (Scott et al., 2011) as well as Cretaceous and Paleocene quartzite conglomerates of the Wyoming fold and thrust belt (DeCelles, 1994) and northwestern Wyoming (Lyndsey, 1972)Intermediate volcanic clasts in the FC facies also have several potential sources
These include upper Cretaceous and Paleocene quartzite conglomerates located near Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that contain a significant proportion (as much as 15 percent) of intermediate volcanic clasts (Lyndsey, 1972), and the Eocene Challis and/or Absaroka volcanic fields of Idaho and Wyoming, respectivelyPrevious studies suggest that a river drained the Challis and/or Absaroka volcanic fields and flowed into southwestern Wyoming in the Eocene (ca
Previous studies suggest that a river drained the Challis and/or Absaroka volcanic fields and flowed into southwestern Wyoming in the Eocene (ca50–47 Ma) (Carroll et al., 2008; Davis et al., 2008; Chetel et al., 2011)
Alternatively, Roehler (1973, 1992) noted that Eocene Washakie Formation conglomeratic sandstones (Adobe Town Member) that crop out in the Washakie Basin to the east of the FC facies outcrop belt have minor quantities of intermediate volcanic clastsIt is conceivable that a west-flowing Bishop Conglomerate river reworked conglomerate of the Washakie Formation to produce the minor volcanic component observed in the FC facies (Fig
2650 Ma detrital zircon grains than the UMG facies, and Archean detrital zircon grains are similarly abundant in the modern Green River, which drains the Wind River Mountains (Fig7)
In summary, the Bishop Conglomerate represents the most significant late Eocene–Oligocene river system of the Uinta Mountains region, but the interpretation of the flow direction of this river is unresolvedAn east- or southeast-flowing late Eocene–early Oligocene river, as envisioned by Hansen (1986) and Fan et al
An east- or southeast-flowing late Eocene–early Oligocene river, as envisioned by Hansen (1986) and Fan et al(2015), is a possible interpretation for the Bishop Conglomerate FC facies, but it would require post-Oligocene, down-to-the-west tilting to explain the present-day elevations of the conglomerate, and it conflicts with FC facies paleocurrent data
(2015), is a possible interpretation for the Bishop Conglomerate FC facies, but it would require post-Oligocene, down-to-the-west tilting to explain the present-day elevations of the conglomerate, and it conflicts with FC facies paleocurrent dataA west-flowing river is consistent with FC facies paleocurrents and conglomerate elevations, but the absence of granitic clasts from the Sierra Madre Mountains is problematic
However, the suggested ages (late Oligo cene to Pliocene) for these rivers are significantly younger than those proposed for the Bishop river system, and deposits of north-flowing rivers draining Laramide uplifts of the Colorado Rocky Mountains should contain granitic clastsFor these reasons, it is unlikely that the Bishop river system is part of the north-flowing river envisioned by Lucchitta et al
Based on stratigraphic and structural relationships in the Browns Park region, Hansen (1986) suggested that the main phase of collapse of the eastern Uinta Mountains occurred between deposition of the Oligocene Bishop Conglomerate and the Miocene Browns Park FormationHowever, tilting and faulting of the Browns Park Formation strata show that deformation continued through at least Miocene time

Hansen (1986) pointed out that this reversal in drainage direction clearly postdated the Bishop Conglomerate, and suggested that collapse of Oligocene topography, on the order of several hundred meters (Bradley, 1936; Hansen, 1986), initiatedthe formation of the Browns Park graben
In this scenario, late Oligocene to early Miocene Browns Park sediments began to accumulate in Browns Park due to a combination of changes in topography, disruption of the Bishop Conglomerate drainage networks, and the formation of the Browns Park graben, which provided accommodation space for Browns Park sedimentsBrowns Park Formation deposits are similarly concentrated in grabens elsewhere in northwestern Colorado and along the Colorado-Wyoming border (Izett, 1975; Luft, 1985; Buffler, 2003).
Browns Park Formation facies and age relationships in the Browns Park graben further support the idea that the transition from coarse-grained Bishop Conglomerate fluvial deposition to fine-grained, tuffaceous Browns Park sedimentation is consistent with extensional collapse in the late OligoceneIn the vicinity of the Little Snake River, excellent exposures of the lower Browns Park Formation show significant numbers of siliceous, micritic, and sometimes  oolitic limestone beds within the lowermost 100 m of the formation
New detrital zircon MDAs constrain the timing of the structural and geomorphic changes to after the late OligoceneExposures of the lower Browns Park Formation along the northern flank of the Little Snake River valley (Fig
In this region, late Miocene Browns Park sediments unconformably onlap Neoproterozoic UMG sandstone beds; the Bishop Conglomerate is absentThe absence of older (older than 12 Ma) Browns Park Formation and Bishop Conglomerate in this area raises the possibility that this region of westernmost Browns Park collapsed more recently than areas located southeast of Lodore Canyon and Vermillion Creek where older sediments are present (Fig
If the Browns Park graben had been completely filled to the level of Bishop Conglomerate paleovalleys that flank the graben, then late Miocene Browns Park Formation rather than ca27 Ma sandy facies of the Bishop Conglomerate would fill the paleovalleys
The importance of Neogene tectonism in modifying earlier uplifts is also seen in numerous areasTo the north of the Uinta Mountains, in central  Wyoming, the southern margin of the Wind River Mountains is marked by east-southeast–west-northwest normal faults (e.g., Sales, 1983; Sutherland and Hausel, 2006)
Precise age control for the timing of fault movement is inferred to be prekinematic to synkinematic to the deposition of the Miocene Split Rock FormationTo the east of this range, the former structural culmination of the Granite Mountains also foundered in north-northeast–south-southwest extension during deposition of the Miocene Moonstone Formation (see Sutherland and Hausel, 2003)
To the east of this range, the former structural culmination of the Granite Mountains also foundered in north-northeast–south-southwest extension during deposition of the Miocene Moonstone Formation (see Sutherland and Hausel, 2003)The age of the Moonstone Formation is constrained by vertebrate paleontology, U-Pb zircon geochronology, and magnetostratigraphically (Prothero et al., 2008)
In addition, there are east-southeast–west-northwest–striking normal faults on the Rock Springs uplift (Love and Christiansen, 1985) and Piceance Basin (Cashion, 1973) that currently lack age control, but may be associated with Miocene extensionFor all of these locations and syntectonic deposits, regional uplift and drainage evolution may have been driven by post-Oligocene mantle convection in the Rocky Mountain region (Karlstrom et al., 2012; Rosenberg et al., 2014), delamination of lithospheric mantle beneath in western Utah (Levander et al., 2011) and central Colorado (Hansen et al., 2013), and a combination of regional plate-related(?) extension plus  mantle forcings affecting the margins of the Colorado Plateau (Ricketts et al., 2016).
For all of these locations and syntectonic deposits, regional uplift and drainage evolution may have been driven by post-Oligocene mantle convection in the Rocky Mountain region (Karlstrom et al., 2012; Rosenberg et al., 2014), delamination of lithospheric mantle beneath in western Utah (Levander et al., 2011) and central Colorado (Hansen et al., 2013), and a combination of regional plate-related(?) extension plus  mantle forcings affecting the margins of the Colorado Plateau (Ricketts et al., 2016).New sedimentological observations and a combination of detrital zircon and sanidine provenance data and age constraints provide insights on the paleo geo graphic and structural evolution of the Uinta Mountains region during the late Eocene to late Miocene (ca

Detrital sanidine and zircon data show that the Bishop Conglomerate and Browns Park Formation contain significant quantities of reworked Cenozoic tephra.Comparisons between the ages of young (younger than 40 Ma) detrital sanidine 40Ar/39Ar and zircon U-Pb age distributions and previously published radiom etric age and chemical data for western North America Cenozoic ignimbrites support the interpretation that the southern Basin and Range volcanic field was an important source of Bishop Conglomerate tephra
