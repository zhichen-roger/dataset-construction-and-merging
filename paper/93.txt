We used geothermochronologic data from sedimentary rocks, coupled with stratigraphic analyses, to unravel the late Paleogene to early Neogene exhumation of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massifThis fault-bounded triangular northernmost promontory of the Northern Andes exposes Precambrian to Paleozoic metamorphic rocks and a Triassic to Jurassic magmatic arc
This fault-bounded triangular northernmost promontory of the Northern Andes exposes Precambrian to Paleozoic metamorphic rocks and a Triassic to Jurassic magmatic arcWe examined the Neogene basin fills of two marginal basins, a western one located along the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault, and a northern one occupying the southern hanging-wall block of the Oca fault
We examined the Neogene basin fills of two marginal basins, a western one located along the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault, and a northern one occupying the southern hanging-wall block of the Oca faultThe western sequence consists of ~1200-m-thick conglomeratic gravity deposits that define a progradational Gilbert-type delta emanating from a scarp coinciding with the present Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault
In order to reconcile these different architectural styles, we propose a regional-scale tilting of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif toward the NE during the late Paleogene–early NeogeneThis model presumes a concomitant evolution of the two sedimentary sequences
Particularly, they lack pre-Grenvillian and Ordovician signals common to Neogene sediments of the wider Miocene Magdalena basinThese marginal basins thus evolved disconnected from the trunk system of the proto–Magdalena River, and they record an initial stage of Oligocene–Miocene segmentation of the South American plate margin
These marginal basins thus evolved disconnected from the trunk system of the proto–Magdalena River, and they record an initial stage of Oligocene–Miocene segmentation of the South American plate marginThese new findings help to better constrain the paleogeographic setting of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif and its marginal basins for the late Oligocene–early Neogene during initial breakup of the Caribbean margin
These new findings help to better constrain the paleogeographic setting of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif and its marginal basins for the late Oligocene–early Neogene during initial breakup of the Caribbean marginTheir sedimentary record depicts an early stage of fault-controlled subsidence of the western margin and a presumably tiltrelated transgression of the northern margin that preceded the Miocene expansion of local depocenters and their merging into a wider embayment of the Neogene Lower Magdalena basin.
Their sedimentary record depicts an early stage of fault-controlled subsidence of the western margin and a presumably tiltrelated transgression of the northern margin that preceded the Miocene expansion of local depocenters and their merging into a wider embayment of the Neogene Lower Magdalena basin.The Northern Andes constitute a distinct tectonic province, characterized by its disintegration into discrete mountain chains and a composite structure of oceanic and continental terranes, commonly referred to as the North Andean block (Pennington, 1981).
Major faults have been active at least since the Pliocene to recent E-W–directed plate convergence facilitating relative movements between stable South America and the Caribbean plate (Boconó, Oca; Audemard and Audemard, 2002; Trenkamp et al., 2002), comprising a widely distributed accommodation zone across the North Andean block with still ill-defined velocity gradients, as deduced from regional global positioning data for Central and South America (CASA Project; Trenkamp et al., 2002; Egbue and Kellogg, 2010)Obliquity between convergence and faults increases toward the NW termination of the North Andean block, as the continental margin bends into an E-W direction to the west of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif
During the Late Cretaceous to Paleocene, a juvenile Caribbean plateau with an associated island arc collided against northern South America (Ayala et al., 2012; Bayona et al., 2011; Cardona et al., 2011a, 2012; Higgs, 2009; Pindell and Kennan, 2009; Spikings et al., 2015; Villagómez et al., 2011), juxtaposing oceanic crust against aGSA Bulletin; March/April 2018; v

This accretion was followed by Eocene collisional shortening, with a concomitant plutonic event that concluded the Cretaceous to Paleogene subduction cycleEvidence for this shortening is provided by a regional mid-Eocene unconformity with a hiatus comprising Paleogene to Cretaceous platform sediments near the continental margin (Villamil, 1999; Gómez et al., 2005)
Evidence for this shortening is provided by a regional mid-Eocene unconformity with a hiatus comprising Paleogene to Cretaceous platform sediments near the continental margin (Villamil, 1999; Gómez et al., 2005)During the Oligocene and Miocene, convergence became increasingly oblique, and, concomitant with the activation of strike-slip faults, the hitherto continuous and emergent continental margin became disrupted by basin-forming normal faults and the consequent opening of the San Jorge and Plato depocenters to the west of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif
During the Oligocene and Miocene, convergence became increasingly oblique, and, concomitant with the activation of strike-slip faults, the hitherto continuous and emergent continental margin became disrupted by basin-forming normal faults and the consequent opening of the San Jorge and Plato depocenters to the west of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massifAs a consequence of the breaching of a hitherto continuous plate margin, the Lower Magdalena basin formed between the Central Cordillera and the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif
Fault-bounded blocks of this structural depression are confined against the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif by the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault, which, in its position as an eastern basin-bounding fault, may have generated much of its present structural relief (>7000 m) by the early Miocene (DuqueCaro, 1979; Mora-Bohórquez et al., 2017; Montes et al., 2010)Considering the junction of the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault with the E-W– trending Oca fault at the NW corner of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif, we investigated the following question: Did this latter fault originate coeval with margin-oblique extension, in concordance with the late Paleogene block tectonics of the Leeward Antilles (Macellari, 1995)?
Considering the junction of the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault with the E-W– trending Oca fault at the NW corner of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif, we investigated the following question: Did this latter fault originate coeval with margin-oblique extension, in concordance with the late Paleogene block tectonics of the Leeward Antilles (Macellari, 1995)?This geomorphic reorganization of the plate margin was, furthermore, accompanied by an important uplift phase of the Eastern Cordillera of Colombia and the consequent division of the Andean retro-arc basin into the inter-Andean Magdalena and external Llanos basins (Mora et al., 2010; Gómez et al., 2005)
The connection between the inter-Andean depression and the corridor at the breached continental margin heralded the modern drainage of the Magdalena River, for which delta sedimentation is interpreted to have begun in the early to middle Miocene (Duque-Caro, 1979; Kolla et al., 1984).In this late Paleogene to early Neogene evolution, an understanding of the timing of exhumation of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif provides an important key to the disruption of the Caribbean plate margin
In this late Paleogene to early Neogene evolution, an understanding of the timing of exhumation of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif provides an important key to the disruption of the Caribbean plate marginRecently elaborated bedrock thermochronology evidences exhumation phases spanning the early Eocene to the Miocene, with older age data (50–40 Ma) being preserved within the southeastern flank of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif and younger ages (25–16 Ma) being concentrated along the western footwall block of the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault (Villagómez et al., 2011)
Recently elaborated bedrock thermochronology evidences exhumation phases spanning the early Eocene to the Miocene, with older age data (50–40 Ma) being preserved within the southeastern flank of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif and younger ages (25–16 Ma) being concentrated along the western footwall block of the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault (Villagómez et al., 2011)The asymmetric Oligocene to Miocene age distribution fits with the stratigraphic constraints of the late Paleogene breaching of the continental margin and highlights the importance of the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault as a basin-bounding normal fault since this epoch.

In this study, we elucidated the early Cenozoic evolution of the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault as a basin-margin fault, examining conglomeratic basin fill in its footwall blockWe investigated if its activity could be deciphered by the architectural organization of this clastic sequence
The integration of these stratigraphic and geochronological data helped us to ascertain the timing of the late Paleogene to early Neogene exhumation of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massifA comparison of our elaborated U-Pb age with published data of late Paleogene sediments of the Magdalena basin suggests that the examined marginal basin was exclusively sourced from pre-Cretaceous basement rocks of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif and that it evolved independently from a regional inter-Andean drainage.

The Cretaceous subduction of the Caribbean plate during convergence occurred at a high angle to the continental margin without strike-slip partitioning (Cortés et al., 2005; Kennan and Pindell, 2009; Vence, 2008)The ensuing Paleogene collisional phase, however, entailed strike-slip reactivation of margin-parallel faults as the North Andean block rotated into its present position (Acosta et al., 2007; Montes et al., 2010; Nova et al., 2013; Vence, 2008)
The ensuing Paleogene collisional phase, however, entailed strike-slip reactivation of margin-parallel faults as the North Andean block rotated into its present position (Acosta et al., 2007; Montes et al., 2010; Nova et al., 2013; Vence, 2008)Relative plate movements approximated their present E-W convergence only in the late Miocene to Pliocene with the activation of the Boconó fault of the Merida Andes (Bermúdez et al., 2010; Egbue and Kellogg, 2010; Javadi et al., 2011).
Relative plate movements approximated their present E-W convergence only in the late Miocene to Pliocene with the activation of the Boconó fault of the Merida Andes (Bermúdez et al., 2010; Egbue and Kellogg, 2010; Javadi et al., 2011).The continental margin is dissected by the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault, an inherited crustal-scale discontinuity that originated during early Mesozoic continental breakup (Kammer and Sánchez, 2006)
The continental margin is dissected by the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault, an inherited crustal-scale discontinuity that originated during early Mesozoic continental breakup (Kammer and Sánchez, 2006)Together with the E-W–trending Oca fault, the Santa Marta– Bucaramanga fault ends at the tip of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif, accommodating northwesterly escape during the late Paleogene to Neogene disruption of the continental margin, as conceptualized by a rootless crustal block that underwent orogenic floating (Audemard and Audemard, 2002; Monod et al., 2010; Oldow et al., 1990).

According to its NW-directed escape and the similar vergence of internal reverse faults, the triangular Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif displays the structural array of a monocline, with its NW corner exposing an imbricated lowercrustal section that is capped on its southeastern flank by a Jurassic magmatic to volcanic arc sequenceRemnants of Cretaceous cover are conserved below a mid-Eocene unconformity only on the northwestern flank of César-Ranchería basin, which encloses the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif to the SE (Tschanz et al., 1974)
Remnants of Cretaceous cover are conserved below a mid-Eocene unconformity only on the northwestern flank of César-Ranchería basin, which encloses the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif to the SE (Tschanz et al., 1974)At its NW corner, low-grade metavolcanic sequences with subordinate sedimentary intercalations belonging to the Caribbean plate have been obducted (Doolan, 1970).
2), the Sierra Nevada Province and the Sevilla metamorphic belt, composed of Precambrian granulites, anorthosites, and gneisses (Cardona et al., 2010a; Cordani et al., 2005; Kroonenberg, 1982; Ordóñez et al., 2002; Restrepo-Pace et al., 1997), the Inner Santa Marta metamorphic belt, composed of a Permian mylonite suite (Cardona et al., 2010c) of orthogneisses and metasedimentary rocks, and a Triassic to Lower Cretaceous suite of high-amphibolite-facies metasedimentary rocks (Zuluaga and Stowell, 2012)At the NW tip of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif, obducted oceanic sequences (Doolan, 1970) comprise the Late Cretaceous–Paleogene Outer Santa Marta metamorphic belt, a suite of meta-basites, phyllites, low-grade metamorphic schists, and metaconglomerates (Cardona et al., 2010b; Doolan, 1970; MacDonald et al., 1971).

The Cretaceous clastic to calcareous platform sediments at the distal rim of the southeastern flank of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif form a sequence some 3000 m thick (Sanchez and Mann, 2015)On the northern flank of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif, Cretaceous limestones are limited to one solitary remnant that outcrops along the Cañas River to the west of the Palomino sequence (Colmenares, 2007)
On the northern flank of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif, Cretaceous limestones are limited to one solitary remnant that outcrops along the Cañas River to the west of the Palomino sequence (Colmenares, 2007)These relations argue for a once-continuous Cretaceous cover
These relations argue for a once-continuous Cretaceous coverThe lack of Cretaceous source material in the examined sequences furthermore supports a denudation phase preceding late Paleogene–early Neogene exhumation
The lack of Cretaceous source material in the examined sequences furthermore supports a denudation phase preceding late Paleogene–early Neogene exhumationSuch a marginwide erosional event can be assigned to the middle Eocene (DuqueCaro, 1979); a hiatus characteristically increases toward the Cretaceous suture, encompassing the Cretaceous and part of the Jurassic magmaticvolcanic arc sequence.

The Cenozoic Aracataca basin straddles the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault in its hanging wall, forms a narrow depositional fill, and is disconnected from the more western Plato depocenter by the Algarrobo high (Mora- Bohórquez et al., 2017; Fig2)
Bedrocks of the eastern footwall block contain the Precambrian Mangos granulite and a Jurassic acid to intermediate plutonic and volcanic suite, which make up the Sierra Nevada Province of Tschanz et al(1974).
The stratigraphic profile consists of a lower shaley to conglomeratic unit with marine fossils, informally designated the Macaraquilla conglomerate (Table 1; Hernandez et al., 2003), and an upper unit of sandstones and conglomerates previously attributed to a fluvial to transitional molasse facies of probable Miocene age (Table 1; Tschanz et al., 1969)This eminently conglomeratic sequence is unconformably overlain by sandstones interbedded with marls and
mudstones of the Zambrano Formation that yield pollen of early Pliocene age (Hernandez et al., 2003)Upper Pliocene deposits are informally referred to as the Guamachito conglomerate, which, further west, gives rise to the distal “Unidad Arenosa de Fundación” (Table 1).
Upper Pliocene deposits are informally referred to as the Guamachito conglomerate, which, further west, gives rise to the distal “Unidad Arenosa de Fundación” (Table 1).The Palomino sequence unconformably overlies the southern footwall of the Oca fault
These basal strata barely exceed 500 m and consist of a systems tract that comprises, from S to N, pebble conglomerates and an intercalation of sandstones and mudstones of a supposed Miocene age (Tschanz et al., 1969).The Aracataca and Palomino sequences both lack a biostratigraphic frame
Our arguments for an Oligocene to early Miocene age for the Aracataca conglomerate is based on its regional correlation with fault-related Paleogene to early Neogene sedimentary fills of various subbasins of the Lower Magdalena basin, as documented by their subsidence histories (Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015; Flinch and Castillo, 2015)This correlation fits the apatite fission-track (AFT) interval of 29–26 Ma reasonably well, which was obtained within the Jurassic Central Batholith at a distance of some 7 km from the Aracataca basin (Villagómez et al., 2011), if interpreted as exhumation ages
This correlation fits the apatite fission-track (AFT) interval of 29–26 Ma reasonably well, which was obtained within the Jurassic Central Batholith at a distance of some 7 km from the Aracataca basin (Villagómez et al., 2011), if interpreted as exhumation agesIn this correlation, we clearly neglect a major lag time between denudation and sedimentation, which we justify by the relatively high exhumation rate of 0.6–0.7 km/m.y

Polymict conglomerates, however, include a wider spectrum of acid and basic volcanic clasts of the Jurassic arc assemblage and granulites of Grenvillian ageMonomict conglomerates occur intermittently throughout the column, while polymict conglomerates tend to be enriched in granitic components at the base and at the transition from sequence II to sequence III, displaying otherwise no distinct variation (Fig
Considering an elevated sediment supply for the progradational setting of a fan delta, the formation of calcareous beds is atypical and may be restricted to minor transgressional cycles, as documented for a Paleogene clastic fan delta in the Ebro Basin (López-Blanco et al., 2000)Isolated outsized clasts embedded within mudstones attest to the presence of a pronounced delta slope, which contributed to their separation from smallersized clasts, according to the high momentum imparted by their fall or downslope tumbling (Nemec, 1990).
For polymict conglomerates, the gross compositional trends of sequences I and II record a gradual increase in input of the Precambrian granulite suite and gneiss components of the southern Sevilla metamorphic belt (Tschanz et al., 1974)Metasedimentary components of the Santa Marta metamorphic belt are, however, conspicuously absent and restrict the catchment area to the central and southern parts of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif
This conglomeratic to sandy sequence forms an isolated patch of Cenozoic sediments to the south of the Oca faultIn an internal or southern position, it involves facies associations that comprise hyperconcentrated mass flows of a braid plain
This sequence overlies Precambrian gneisses of the Sevilla metamorphic belt (Tschanz et al., 1974), a quartz monzonite of probable Jurassic age, which has been mapped as the Palomino Stock (Tschanz et al., 1974), and a Late Jurassic volcanic suiteFurther toward the hinterland, the basement exposes the Precambrian Mangos granulite and igneous to volcanic suites of the Sierra Nevada Province (Tschanz et al., 1974).
Further toward the hinterland, the basement exposes the Precambrian Mangos granulite and igneous to volcanic suites of the Sierra Nevada Province (Tschanz et al., 1974).We discuss this sequence by means of a southern conglomeratic section and a northern sandy section, each one resting unconformably on the Jurassic igneous or Precambrian metamorphic basement (Fig
We discuss this sequence by means of a southern conglomeratic section and a northern sandy section, each one resting unconformably on the Jurassic igneous or Precambrian metamorphic basement (Fig4)
Their equivalent structural position above a pre-Cretaceous basement suggests that the facies associations of these two sections belong to an equivalent systems tractCorrelative sequences are associated with (I) a gravelly braid plain, (II) a sandy floodplain, and (III) a shoreface environment
Clast counts from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif (SNSM), Cenozoic Aracataca and Palomino basins, at the Negro and Aracataca Rivers, respectively, where counts were done following the ribbon method (Howard, 1993).TABLE 3
The heavy mineral spectra found in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif Neogene sedimentary rocks include garnet, chlorite, amphibole, pyroxene, rutile, muscovite, biotite, andalusite, sphene, tourmaline, epidote, and opaque minerals such as ilmenite and pyrite (Table 5)The Aracataca conglomerates samples CVI-1302 and CVI-13115 contain rutile, pyroxenes, and garnet

This population significantly decreases up section, and Precambrian ages become dominantIn the Aracataca basin, samples CP088 and CVI-13115 are similar, with core ages mainly from 1360 to 950 Ma and a minor population of zircons with Mesozoic (190–130 Ma) crystallization ages
In the Aracataca basin, samples CP088 and CVI-13115 are similar, with core ages mainly from 1360 to 950 Ma and a minor population of zircons with Mesozoic (190–130 Ma) crystallization agesOne zircon with a discordant MesoArchean core age of 2970 Ma was also detected.
One zircon with a discordant MesoArchean core age of 2970 Ma was also detected.Zircons from sample CVI-1302 have ages older than 800 Ma, with maximum relative ages at 1100 Ma, 1200 Ma, and 1320 Ma, similar to sample EMP-16
Samples AP-45 and EMP-49a from the northern basin show nearly equal age trends, with the most significant population at 1000 Ma in both samples and lesser Triassic and Jurassic ages in sample AP-45The only significant difference between ages from samples of the Aracataca and Palomino sequences is the increase in the relative abundance of a 1300 Ma older component in the Aracataca basin (Fig
Detrital zircon U-Pb laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) probability density plots obtained from the post-Eocene sediments of the western and northern foothills of the Sierra Nevada de Santa (Aracataca and Palomino basins); errors are presented at the 2σ levelData are organized from base to top for each basin; zircon populations are intimately related, implying the same sources supplied sediments to both basins, with an older signature in the Aracataca basin at the western border of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif
There are two main zircon U-Pb age populations in the detrital spectra from the Neogene sedimentary rocks of the Aracataca and Palomino sequencesProterozoic ages correspond to a widespread population around 1400–85Ma, found in the high-grade metamorphic rocks from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif and the Alta Guajira massifs (Weber et al., 2010), which were reworked during the Neogene
Proterozoic ages correspond to a widespread population around 1400–85Ma, found in the high-grade metamorphic rocks from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif and the Alta Guajira massifs (Weber et al., 2010), which were reworked during the NeogeneThis population can be related to the Grenvillian belt in the Northern Andes (Cardona et al., 2010a; Restrepo-Pace et al., 1997).
Zircon populations from the conglomerate’s matrix are strictly dominated by the Precambrian U-Pb signal, implying the following as main sources for the Neogene sediments in the Aracataca and Palomino sequences: Precambrian granulites from the Sierra Nevada Province, and gneisses from the Sevilla metamorphic belt, as the detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra show evidence of the reworking of a Precambrian basement older than ca850 Ma.
This composite Proterozoic signature has been detected in Precambrian inliers of the Northern Andes (Cardona et al., 2010a, 2006; Cordani et al., 2005), as well as in post-Permian metamorphic rocks of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif, the Alta Guajira, and in Cenozoic sediments of the Leeward Antilles (Cardona et al., 2010c; Weber et al., 2010; Zapata et al., 2014)Jurassic and Cretaceous zircons are related to volcaniclastic deposits and arc granodiorites and syenogranites
Jurassic and Cretaceous zircons are related to volcaniclastic deposits and arc granodiorites and syenogranitesThese zircons indicate the constant erosion of the Central Batholith of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif, as well as the associated Jurassic plutonic and volcanic units

Geochronological data and detailed sedimentology indicate deposition in a Gilbert-type delta system that traversed the Santa Marta– Bucaramanga fault in the western basin, which developed since the late OligoceneThe bottomset segment, with an input of mainly granodiorites, is related to the Aracataca Batholith, part of the Central Batholith suite
The foreset shows a mixture of Precambrian and Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous ages.Zircons found in Neogene sedimentary rocks of the Aracataca and Palomino sequences are subrounded to subangular, and the presence of unstable heavy minerals indicates a relatively short sediment transport distance from the source area
Zircons found in Neogene sedimentary rocks of the Aracataca and Palomino sequences are subrounded to subangular, and the presence of unstable heavy minerals indicates a relatively short sediment transport distance from the source areaThe presence of rutile is also characteristic of high-grade regionally metamorphosed terrains (Force, 1980), indicating that the conglomerates are highly immature.
Provenance of the Aracataca and Palomino sequences shows that during the Oligocene– Miocene, sediments were sourced from the Sierra Nevada Province, and there is evidence that the Santa Marta Batholith and Buritaca Pluton were not undergoing surface denudation during Oligocene–Miocene timesA drainage system
This would explain the early Miocene exhumation of the Eocene batholiths and the absence of Paleocene–Eocene zircons in both basins.The Buritaca Pluton yielded an early Miocene AFT age of 22.3 ± 3.1 Ma (Villagómez et al., 2011) and is cut by N-S drainages, but in the sedimentary rocks of Palomino sequence, there is no record of Paleogene zircons; therefore, it is possible to constrain the deposition of the sediments in this basin to the middle Miocene (ca
The Buritaca Pluton yielded an early Miocene AFT age of 22.3 ± 3.1 Ma (Villagómez et al., 2011) and is cut by N-S drainages, but in the sedimentary rocks of Palomino sequence, there is no record of Paleogene zircons; therefore, it is possible to constrain the deposition of the sediments in this basin to the middle Miocene (ca16 Ma), considering a lag time of 5 m.y
Sediments deposited after the unroofing of the Buritaca Pluton containing Eocene zircons probably bypassed offshore into the late Miocene–Pliocene deposits (Vence, 2008).Lower Miocene sedimentary rocks found either in the Aracataca and the Palomino basins correspond to proximal fan delta and estuary systems that developed during the first pulse of surface uplift of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif during the late Oligocene
Lower Miocene sedimentary rocks found either in the Aracataca and the Palomino basins correspond to proximal fan delta and estuary systems that developed during the first pulse of surface uplift of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif during the late OligoceneThe clockwise rotation of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif toward the east led to the development of an extensional phase defining the Lower Magdalena basin as a rotational basin linked to the advance of the Caribbean plate (Bayona et al., 2010; Montes et al., 2010)
At the western edge of the Plato–San Jorge basin, the Romeral suture separated the continental basement of South America from the Caribbean intra-oceanic crust that hosted volcanic arcs and accreted during the PaleoceneCrustal thickening by terrane accretion evolved into collisional plutonism during the Eocene, transmitting a characteristically mixed oceanic arc–basement zircon U-Pb age signal in the Paleogene sediments from the San Jacinto belt (Cardona et al., 2012)

During the Miocene, in the Plato–San Jorge, the Lower Magdalena, and the San Jacinto basins, distal deposits of mudstones, siltstones, and carbonate facies were deposited in a lowenergy environment, coeval with the conglomerates of the Aracataca and Palomino sequences (Fig12).
2) share Paleocene–Eocene zircon U-Pb ages and outcrop close to both the Aracataca and Palomino sequences, but Paleogene zircon U-Pb ages are not found within these sedimentary rocksIn contrast, Paleocene deposits from the Cesar-Ranchería basin (Fig
In contrast, Paleocene deposits from the Cesar-Ranchería basin (Fig2) contain a distinctive population of zircons from this epoch (Bayona et al., 2011).
Zircon U-Pb ages from the Lower Eocene Misoa Formation, and the Cerrejón and Tabaco Formations from the Cesar-Ranchería basin, indeed overlap with zircon U-Pb ages of plutons in the Santa Marta metamorphic belt, but erosion of these source rocks during the Paleocene seems unlikely because of the Miocene cooling histories documented for these igneous rocks (Villagómez et al., 2011)Accordingly, the Palomino conglomerates lack corresponding quartz-dioritic and tonalitic components in this intrusive suite.
In this context, the Late Cretaceous–Paleogene zircon U-Pb populations in the Cesar-Ranchería basin (56–70 Ma) are probably related to a volcanic source found further to the east, as evidenced by tuffs within the Misoa Formation of the Maracaibo basin, coeval with the Eocene Tabaco Formation (Bayona et al., 2011).Paleocurrent directions measured in the Cerrejón Formation show an E to SE trend (Bayona et al., 2011), given that the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif has rotated clockwise by ~30° after the Eocene, according to Montes et al
Paleocurrent directions measured in the Cerrejón Formation show an E to SE trend (Bayona et al., 2011), given that the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif has rotated clockwise by ~30° after the Eocene, according to Montes et al(2010), and paleocurrent directions result in E to NE flow directions for the Cerrejón Formation, which in turn are coherent with an E-NE sediment dispersal direction during the early to mid-Paleocene, 65–58 Ma, as documented by Ayala et al
(2010), and paleocurrent directions result in E to NE flow directions for the Cerrejón Formation, which in turn are coherent with an E-NE sediment dispersal direction during the early to mid-Paleocene, 65–58 Ma, as documented by Ayala et al(2012)
In this epoch, the Precambrian, Permian–Triassic, and Cretaceous zircons found in the Cerrejón and Tabaco Formations from the Cesar-Ranchería basin may not be exclusively derived from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif and could also have been supplied by the rocks of the proto–Perijá Range, which yield Permian to Jurassic granitoids as well (Martin, 1968), and the Central Cordillera (Mora-Bohórquez et al., 2017), considering that the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif, Perijá Range, and Central Cordillera were exhumed inFigure 13
During first stages, proto–Caribbean arc approaches South America and obducts the NW tip of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif; subduction during the Late Cretaceous ca75 Ma in this part of the North Andean margin is interpreted from paleogeographic reconstruction of Mora-Bohórquez et al
(2017); in the late Eocene, slab flattening is responsible for the reactivation of crustal structures as the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault (SMBF); ve—verticalprefiguring a steep slope (drainage basin of Aracataca conglomerates) and ramp with a gentle inclination (Palomino subbasin)
Transition in the Caribbean plate subduction angle from 30° to a shallower dipping subduction between 4° and 8° occurred between the late Eocene and middle Miocene (Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015)Since the late Eocene, a relevant change in the subduction regime is evidenced by the gradual cessation of arc plutonism and late cooling, which during the Oligocene–M iocene is defined by a gently inclined slab dipping less than 30°

The establishment of a shallower dipping slab 4°–8° since the middle Miocene was related to the subsequent underthrusting of a thickened Caribbean crust under NW South America, responsible for the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault reactivation (Kammer and Sánchez, 2006; Villagómez et al., 2011) and accumulation of left-lateral slip as the Caribbean plate moved to the east during the late Miocene

The Miocene activity of the Orihueca fault marks a tectonic pulse driven by a significant variation in convergence rate between the Caribbean and South American plates, and the shift from collision to transpression that produced the increased NW-verging thrusting in the interior of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif (Fig14), culminating in the displacement shift from normal to dextral slip of the Oca fault, which segmented the Guajira basin from the North Andean margin in the Pliocene and displaced it to its current location ~55 km to the east (Kellogg, 1984; Tschanz et al., 1974).

Post-Oligocene sedimentary rocks found in the Aracataca basin show a major input from Precambrian source rocks from the Sierra Nevada ProvinceThis major input was the consequence of the unroofing of the basement, which accelerated after the deposition of the Aracataca conglomerates foresets
The shift in composition of the clasts means that the Aracataca conglomerates are growth strata that evidence both extension tectonics along the Santa Marta– Bucaramanga fault since the late Oligocene and exhumation of the massif through NW-verging thrusts occurring at least since the early Miocene, supported by AFT and ZFT cooling ages.The Precambrian source material was derived from inherited Grenvillian terranes that passed through the apatite partial annealing zone approximately since 25–20 Ma and were subsequently exhumed and affected by surface erosion.
The Precambrian source material was derived from inherited Grenvillian terranes that passed through the apatite partial annealing zone approximately since 25–20 Ma and were subsequently exhumed and affected by surface erosion.The sudden change from muddy oligomictic conglomerates and siltstones to a coarser facies in the sediments points to a steepening slope in the source areas, which led to debris flow into a Gilbert-type delta environment during the transition from a shallow-marine to a more fluvialdominated environment
Provenance analysis of the basin sediments clearly shows that the clastic material was derived by erosion of Precambrian inliers in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif, and that Permian–Triassic, and Late Cretaceous accreted terrains at the NW corner of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif did not contribute to sediments, as these tectonic blocks were not yet exhumed during Oligocene–Miocene times.The major shift in provenance between the bottomset and foresets of the Aracataca conglomerates was related to exhumation of the massif during increasing displacement along the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault, which occurred between the late Oligocene and early Miocene
The major shift in provenance between the bottomset and foresets of the Aracataca conglomerates was related to exhumation of the massif during increasing displacement along the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault, which occurred between the late Oligocene and early MioceneThe increase in the variety of source rock lithologies in the stratigraphic record is evidence for unroofing of the Precambrian basement and the Central Batholith suite.
The increase in the variety of source rock lithologies in the stratigraphic record is evidence for unroofing of the Precambrian basement and the Central Batholith suite.Detrital thermochronologic ages from the Aracataca basin are evidence for the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault being responsible for the increase in relief of the western flank of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif, as it acted coeval with NW-verging thrusts
In the Palomino basin, extensional faulting started in the late Eocene–Oligocene with the onset of dextral strike-slip activity of the Oca fault in the Miocene as a consequence of the coupling of South American crust and Caribbean crustThis caused faster exhumation of the western flank of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif, exhuming lower-crustal levels that acted as sources for the Miocene sequences that yield the oldest zircon U-Pb ages and younger detrital ZFT and AFT ages.
