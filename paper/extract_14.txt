The Indus-Yarlung suture zone formed when the Indian continental landmass collided with the southern fl ank of Eurasia during late Paleocene– early Eocene time (Besse et al., 1984; Garzanti et al., 1987; Leech et al., 2005; Green et al., 2008)Along much of the length of the suture zone, rocks of the northern (Tethyan) Himalayan thrust belt and ophiolitic mélange were juxtaposed by the south-dipping Great Counter thrust against rocks of the Gangdese magmatic arc complex (Heim and Gansser, 1939; Burg et al., 1987; Yin et al., 1999; Murphy and Yin, 2003)

Barring such tests, several considerations provide some confi dence in the results: The paleosol carbonate nodules we analyzed are uniformly micritic, burial depth in the Kailas red-bed member was probably modest (e.g., less than 2 km), and both our carbon and oxygen isotope results are quite similar to those from early Miocene paleosols at Nima in central Tibet, from which we also concluded that paleoelevations stood at >4500 m at that time (DeCelles et al., 2007b).The measured sections and additional fi eld observations demonstrate that the Kailas Formation coarsens northward toward its basal contact with the Kailas magmatic complex

Lithofacies in the red-bed member are similar to those in the roughly contemporaneous Nima Basin of central Tibet, which is documented to have been at high paleoelevation by late Oligocene time (DeCelles et al., 2007a, 2007b)The abrupt change from an essentially noncalcareous to a highly calcareous depositional environment in the red-bed member is unlikely to have been simply a matter of changing provenance, because carbonate clasts and calcite cement are also present in the lower part of the Kailas Formation

Early to middle Miocene activation of several major thrust systems in the Himalaya, including the Main Central, Ramgarh, and Great Counter thrusts (which together accommodate at least 300 km of shortening), refl ects this new mode of hard collision.This explanation for the kinematics of the Kailas basin is advantageous because it does not require post-Eocene oceanic subduction outboard of an irregular northern Indian continental margin; it can be reconciled with regional petrologic, metamorphic, structural, and sedimentological data sets; and a drastic revision in the timing of initial Indo-Eurasia collision (Aitchison et al., 2007) is unnecessary

Similar timing of slab break-off and/or lithosphere removal events is derived from petrol ogical studies of Eocene–Miocene igneous rocks in the Lhasa terrane (e.g., Miller et al., 1999; Chung et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2009).Numerous workers have suggested that the development and subsequent exhumation to midcrustal depths of eclogites in the northern Himalayan thrust belt during Eocene time required initial subduction by slab-pull forces, followed by buoyant rise when the Neotethyan oceanic lithospheric slab broke off and foundered into the mantle (Chemenda et al., 2000; O’Brien et al., 2001; Kohn and Parkinson, 2002; de Sigoyer et al., 2000; Guillot et al., 2003; Leech et al., 2005)

In contrast, the uppermost part of the stratigraphic section contains abundant paleosol carbonate and redbed paleosols, similar to previously documented Oligocene–Miocene lithofacies in the central part of the Tibetan Plateau from which we have obtained carbon and oxygen isotope data that are consistent with very high paleoelevation by late Oligocene timeWe tentatively suggest that the Kailas basin developed at comparatively low elevations until deposition of the uppermost part of the Kailas Formation.
