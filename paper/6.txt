The Tangga mélange consists of Late Triassic–Early Cretaceous abyssal chert and siliceous shale with blocks of chert and mafic to ultra-mafic rocks
The Tangga mélange was accreted beneath ophiolitic rocks during the Aptian
The Pomunong mélange consists of a Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous hemipelagic siliceous shale and chert matrix with blocks from Early Permian seamounts and from Late Cretaceous trench-fill sandstones; it was accreted beneath the Tangga mélange after the Aptian but prior to 71 Ma
Structurally beneath these mélanges to the south, the uppermost Cretaceous Rongmawa Formation consists of turbiditic sandstone, pelagic chert, and siliceous shale and records a transition in depositional setting from lower abyssal plain to upper trench
Early studies argued that Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere was entirely consumed along this margin since Cretaceous time (Searle et al., 1987)
An alternate model, however, proposes that the Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere subducted along both an intra-oceanic subduction zone within the Neo-Tethys Ocean and an oceanic subduction zone beneath the southern margin of the Lhasa terrane during Cretaceous to Eocene time (Aitchison, 2000, 2007a)
More recently, the complex has been divided into the Zedong terrane, the Dazhuqu terrane, and the Bainang terrane (Aitchison, 2000), interpreted to have formed in an intra-oceanic arc and subduction zone setting, prior to being obducted onto the Tethyan Himalayan margin during the Eocene (Aitchison, 2000, 2007a)
The Gangdese arc consists of Cretaceous (and locally older Mesozoic) to Early Cenozoic calc-alkaline granitoids (Chu et al., 2006; Debon et al., 1986; Zhu et al., 2011a) and 43–68 Ma nonmarine volcanic sequences of the Linzizong Group (He et al., 2007)
Scarce sedimentary rocks of Late Triassic to Late Cretaceous age are also exposed within the Gangdese arc
The geochemistry of the Lower Cretaceous adakite-like Sangri Group suggests that arc magmatism, and by inference northward subduction of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere, initiated by Early Cretaceous time (Zhu et al., 2009a)
The northern Lhasa terrane exposes mainly Upper Paleozoic to Cenozoic sedimentary strata with volcanic interbeds and Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous granites (Kapp et al., 2003; Volkmer et al., 2007)
The Xigaze forearc basin is exposed along the southern margin of Lhasa terrane and consists of Albian– Maastrichtian marine strata (Wan et al., 1997) that are locally overlain unconformably by the Paleocene Tso-jiangding Group (Ding et al., 2005)
The Yarlung–Zangpo suture zone exposes Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous back arc and/or intraoceanic arc-affinity ophiolites (Bedard et al., 2009; Dubois-Côté et al., 2005; Hébert, et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2010; Malpas et al., 2003) in the north and several accretionary mélange units structurally below the ophiolites in the south
The serpentinite melange in turn structurally overlies a mud-matrix mélange to the south, which consists of a Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous matrix that envelops weakly deformed sedimentary blocks of Permian to Cretaceous age (Wang et al., 1999)
Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous island-arc volcanic rocks are exposed in the Zedong area ~300 km to the east of Xigaze (Aitchison et al., 2007b; McDermid et al., 2002)
The Eocene to Miocene (Wei et al., 2011) Liuqu Conglomerate is the youngest unit exposed in the suture zone; it is thought to be either (1) related to obduction of oceanic rocks onto the Tethyan Himalayan margin prior to the India–Asia collision (McDermid et al., 2002) or (2) post-collisional, in that it includes detritus derived from both the deformed Xigaze forearc basin to the north and the Tethyan Himalaya to the south (Wang et al., 2010).
South of the suture zone are the Paleozoic to Eocene strata of the northern Tethyan Himalaya that were deposited on the distal continental margin of India (Ding et al., 2005; Liu and Einsele, 1994; Willems et al., 1996; Yin, 2006).
Radiolarian biostratigraphy indicates that the pelagic chert was deposited during the Late Barremian to Late Aptian (Girardeau et al., 1984)
The serpentinite-matrix mélange is fault-bounded against the ophiolitic belt in north and the Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous red radiolarian
The age of the matrix ranges from Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous whereas the sedimentary blocks range from Permian to Late Cretaceous in age (Li and Shen, 2005; Zhu et al., 2005)
Radiolarian fossils indicate a Late Triassic to Early Cretaceous age (Zhu et al., 2005; Ziabrev et al., 2004)
Radiolarian fossils in the matrix suggest a Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age (Zhu et al., 2005).
The presence of corals, fusulinids, and brachiopods within the limestone indicates an Early Permian age (Li and Shen, 2005).
The Rongmawa Formation, first defined in this paper, is faultbounded between the Pomunong mélange to the north and the Triassic Tethyan Himalayan strata to the south
The youngest detrital zircon ages (71±1 Ma; 71±1 Ma; 73±2 Ma), provide a Late Cretaceous maximum depositional age for the upper Rongmawa Formation.
The detrital zircon ages of the Cambrian–Cretaceous strata in the Tethyan Himalaya sequence are dominated by populations of 480–570 Ma, 750–1200 Ma, and 2430–2560 Ma (Amos et al., 2008; DeCelles et al., 2000; Gehrels et al., 2011; Myrow et al., 2003)
The 200–400 Ma population from the Triassic strata near Zedong and Renbu in southern Tibet is considered to have been derived from the Lhasa terrane rather than the Tethyan Himalaya (Amos et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010)
Significant pre-Mesozoic zircons are present in the Upper Cretaceous Ngamring and Padana Formations (Wu et al., 2010).
Detrital zircon ages from the pre-Cenozoic sedimentary strata in the Lhasa terrane display major age populations at 100–160 Ma, 200–600 Ma, and 700–1300 Ma with minor age populations of 1800–2000 Ma and 2400–2500 Ma (DeCelles et al., 2007; Gehrels et al., 2011; Leier et al., 2007a, 2007b; Zhu et al., 2011b).
Mesozoic zircons (71–234 Ma, 16 percent of the total zircon grains) found in these blocks were likely derived from the Gangdese arc and/or recycled forearc strata since except for the Early Cretaceous Wolong volcanics, no Late Cretaceous or Triassic– Jurassic magmatism has been recorded in Tethyan Himalaya.
This is because all samples from the Rongmawa Formation and the Pomunong mélange show a similar mix of Mesozoic and >500 Ma zircon ages as those of the Upper Ngamring and Padana Formations from the Xigaze forearc basin (Wu et al., 2010) and the Takena Formation in the Gangdese retro-arc foreland basin (Leier et al., 2007b), both derived from the Lhasa terrane.
The chert-matrix of the Tangga mélange is 500 to 2000 m thick and accumulated between the Late Triassic and the Early Cretaceous
During Barremian–Early Aptian, the tectonics of the Neo-Tethys changed considerably
The initiation of subduction beneath the Lhasa Terrane occurred during the Barremian as constrained by studies of a Tethyan metamorphic sole (Guilmette et al., 2009)
The initial northward subduction of the Neo-Tethys lithosphere beneath the southern margin of the Lhasa terrane created the Early Cretaceous adakite-like Sangri Group (Zhu et al., 2009a, 2011a,b) in the southern Lhasa terrane
The Barremian supra-subduction zone ophiolite rocks and the serpentinite mélange were formed in the overriding plate at this time (Bedard et al., 2009; Dubois-Côté et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2010)
This is a result of the accretion of Tethyan oceanic rocks to the Asian margin by or during Albian time
During the Late Aptian, Upper Triassic–Lower Aptian chert deposited in an abyssal setting entered the subduction zone beneath the Lhasa terrane
In this manner, we determine the maximum accretion age of the Tangga mélange to be Aptian since it is buried conformably by siliceous mudstone and mudstone containing silt-sized terrigenous matterials (Matsuoka et al., 2002; Ziabrev et al., 2004)
The Aptian aged chert matrix of this unit further confirms this maximum age of accretion (Matsuoka et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2005; Ziabrev et al., 2004).
The near absence of turbidite deposits in the Early Cretaceous may be the result of the Xigaze forearc basin being underfilled until the Campanian (Wan et al., 1997)
We state above that the matrix of Pomunong mélange is Early Aptian in age and encompasses latest Cretaceous trench-fill blocks of sandstone
Development of trench strata during the latest Cretaceous (b71 Ma), indicates that Pomunong mélange accretion was complete by this time
Long-term accretion of different slivers from Permian to Late Cretaceous in age along the Yarlung–Zangpo suture zone indicates that most of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere was consumed by northward subduction beneath the southern Asian margin
Field observations, structural–stratigraphic studies, detrital zircon U–Pb ages, and petrographic data from an accretionary complex along the Yarlung–Zangpo suture zone in southern Tibet reveal a protracted record of subduction and accretion of Neo-Tethys oceanic rocks along the southern margin of the Asian continent during the Cretaceous
The trapped ophiolitic rocks, ophiolitic mélange, offscrapped Tangga and Pomunong mélanges, and trench strata compose a Cretaceous accretionary complex that formed along the southern continental margin of Asia
The Cretaceous accretionary complex, formed in single subduction zone within the Neo-Tethys Ocean during the Cretaceous, was already accreted to the southern margin of Asia at the time of the India–Asia collision.
