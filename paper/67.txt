aBStract: Upper Cretaceous sandstones are the main clastic reservoirs of the Santos Basin, eastern Brazil, showing high porosity at depths greater than 4000 mPorosity preservation in these deep sandstones is ascribed to the inhibition of quartz cementation and pressure dissolution by authigenic porelining chlorite
6), but actually corresponds to a mixture between a feldspathic composition, related to uplifted plutonic basement terrains of the Serra do Mar, VRF derived from the Lower Cretaceous Serra Geral plateau and from intrabasinal and extrabasinal Upper Cretaceous volcanism, and sedimentary–metasedimentary rock fragments from supracrustal, recycled orogenic terrains.The main diagenetic processes which affect Santos sandstones are mechanical and chemical compaction, alteration and dissolution of VRF and feldspars, and precipitation of chlorite, albite, calcite, quartz, titanium oxides, pyrite and siderite.
Burial and thermal history representative of the Upper Cretaceous sandstones in the area studied from the Santos Basin, illustrating present and maximum burial depth and temperature, and the substantially greater burial of the rift section.(Fig
As the rift source rocks of the Guaratiba Group were characteristically buried before and at substantially greater depths than the Upper Cretaceous sandstones (Fig4), the potential for porosity preservation owing to early migration and elevated hydrocarbon saturation in the reservoirs must be considered, and

Upper Cretaceous sandstones of the Santos Basin are poorly sorted, coarse- to mostly fine-grained arkoses and lithic arkoses, rich in volcanic rock fragmentsThe main observed diagenetic processes are mechanical compaction, alteration and dissolution of VRF and feldspars, and precipitation of pore-lining chlorites, subordinately of quartz, calcite, albite, Ti oxides, pyrite, siderite, and dolomite.
Broader petrologic and geochemical studies are required to constrain the controls and to define the patterns of temporal, stratigraphic and geographical distribution of authigenic chlorites in the Upper Cretaceous sandstones, in order to allow the development of effective models for reservoir quality prediction, which may effectively contribute to the reduction of exploration risks in the Santos Basin.The authors thank Petrobras for the access to samples and for the licence to publish this work, as well as the support of UFRGS, PUC-RS, and LHB-Endeeper
