The Upper Jurassic Ula sandstone, Norwegian North Sea, a subarkose with 15 to 25 percent feldspar, displays stylolites with prominent low-porosity haloes up to 10 cm wideDetailed mineralogical and chemical profiles across several stylolites and haloes are used to investigate the role of feldspar in mineral reactions at stylolites and to constrain the transport of chemical components.
In the Middle Jurassic Brent sandstones of the North Sea, for example, stylolites first appear at a depth of approximately 3000 meters and a temperature of approximately 100uCThe volume of quartz cement begins to increase dramatically at that depth, such that at a depth only 400 meters deeper, the volume has effectively increased 3 to 4 fold, from 1–2 percent to 1–12 percent (Harris 1992 and references therein)
Upper Jurassic Ula sands were deposited on a shallow-water platform on the hanging wall of the Hidra fault system, which separates the Sydvestlandet Platform from the Central Graben.grains and mica or clay
This paper reports on stylolites in sandstones from the feldspathic Upper Jurassic marine Ula Formation, offshore NorwayThe stylolites are distinctive for the presence of low-porosity haloes that surround the actual stylolite seam
The 7/8-3 well, drilled in 1984–1985, discovered a subcommercial oil pool at 3700 m depth in the northern part of the Ula trend, a belt of oil accumulations in Middle and Upper Jurassic sandstones on the southwestern margin of theFIG
2.—Upper Jurassic stratigraphy in the Central Graben–Southern Vestland Arch areaModified from Underhill (1998) and Bergan et al
The Ula trend occurs on the northeast shoulder of the Central Graben, a major structure that was active from the Middle Jurassic through the Late CretaceousOil was generated from the Upper Jurassic Mandal Formation beginning in the Late Cretaceous from the deeper parts of the Central Graben and currently is being generated in the Ula trend (Taylor et al
Oil was generated from the Upper Jurassic Mandal Formation beginning in the Late Cretaceous from the deeper parts of the Central Graben and currently is being generated in the Ula trend (Taylor et al1999).
Oil accumulations in the Ula trend occur in the Upper Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) Ula Formation (Fig2; Bergan et al
This unit is a shallow marine sandstone up to 200 m thick that prograded across outer-shelf mudstones, following a sealevel drop in the early KimmeridgianThe thickest accumulations of sand occur on the downthrown side of basin-bounding faults
(1994) have identified five Upper Jurassic sequences in the Ula Trend and suggested that the name Ula Formation be discarded.Gluyas (1997) described Ula Formation sandstones at Ula field as arkosic and interpreted them as having been derived from nearby Triassic sandstones
Gluyas (1997) described Ula Formation sandstones at Ula field as arkosic and interpreted them as having been derived from nearby Triassic sandstonesHe notes that they are significantly affected by quartz cementation, with quartz cement volume ranging from as little as 3 percent to as much as 19 percent
(1996) also analyzed Upper Jurassic sandstone reservoirs from the Gyda and Ula fields at depths from 3970 to 4320 meters but arrived at a different conclusion regarding controls on porosityThey described a population of high-porosity sandstones that they related to the presence of microcrystalline quartz coatings, visible on SEM examination, and in turn to the original presence of sponge spicules.
The Ula sandstone underwent more than 2000 meters of subsidence since the early OligocenePossibly as a consequence of the rapid Late Tertiary subsidence, the Ula sandstone is significantly overpressured
Holm (1998) relates the development of overpressure in Jurassic sandstones of the Central Graben to hydrocarbon generation in the overlying Farsund Formation.The Ula sandstone is 43.5 meters thick in the 7/8-3 well and unconformably overlies metamorphic basement (Fig
As in other Jurassic sandstones on the northwest European continental margin, these Kfeldspar cements formed early and are now partially dissolved.Authigenic clay constitutes a small proportion of the rock volume, amounting to less than 1 percent
Quartz cement abundance is controlled by stylolite frequency only at a scale of tens of meters, for example in Upper Jurassic sandstones at the East Brae field, North Sea (Grau 2000).Because aluminum is relatively immobile, dissolution of K-feldspar at the edge of a stylolite produces a halo of illite in the sandstone adjacent to the stylolite
