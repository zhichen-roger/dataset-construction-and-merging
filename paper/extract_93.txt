Our arguments for an Oligocene to early Miocene age for the Aracataca conglomerate is based on its regional correlation with fault-related Paleogene to early Neogene sedimentary fills of various subbasins of the Lower Magdalena basin, as documented by their subsidence histories (Bernal-Olaya et al., 2015; Flinch and Castillo, 2015)This correlation fits the apatite fission-track (AFT) interval of 29–26 Ma reasonably well, which was obtained within the Jurassic Central Batholith at a distance of some 7 km from the Aracataca basin (Villagómez et al., 2011), if interpreted as exhumation ages

The Miocene activity of the Orihueca fault marks a tectonic pulse driven by a significant variation in convergence rate between the Caribbean and South American plates, and the shift from collision to transpression that produced the increased NW-verging thrusting in the interior of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif (Fig14), culminating in the displacement shift from normal to dextral slip of the Oca fault, which segmented the Guajira basin from the North Andean margin in the Pliocene and displaced it to its current location ~55 km to the east (Kellogg, 1984; Tschanz et al., 1974).

The shift in composition of the clasts means that the Aracataca conglomerates are growth strata that evidence both extension tectonics along the Santa Marta– Bucaramanga fault since the late Oligocene and exhumation of the massif through NW-verging thrusts occurring at least since the early Miocene, supported by AFT and ZFT cooling ages.The Precambrian source material was derived from inherited Grenvillian terranes that passed through the apatite partial annealing zone approximately since 25–20 Ma and were subsequently exhumed and affected by surface erosion.

Provenance analysis of the basin sediments clearly shows that the clastic material was derived by erosion of Precambrian inliers in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif, and that Permian–Triassic, and Late Cretaceous accreted terrains at the NW corner of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta massif did not contribute to sediments, as these tectonic blocks were not yet exhumed during Oligocene–Miocene times.The major shift in provenance between the bottomset and foresets of the Aracataca conglomerates was related to exhumation of the massif during increasing displacement along the Santa Marta–Bucaramanga fault, which occurred between the late Oligocene and early Miocene
