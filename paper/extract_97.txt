The Columbia River Basalt Group blanketed eastern Washington and Oregon in the Miocene (Reidel et al., 1989a, 1989b, 1994, 2013), and so the modern topography of the Yakima fold province has been generated since mid-Miocene time (Reidel, 1984; Watters, 1989)While the landscape of eastern and central Washington is largely mantled in Miocene flood basalts, exploratory oil and gas drilling has locally revealed the underlying stratigraphy

While deformation along the Saddle Mountains is mainly preserved in the Columbia River Basalt Group, several studies have suggested that deformation initiated prior to the Miocene and continues today (Malone et al., 1975; West et al., 1996; Casale and Pratt, 2015)Seismicreflection data across the Saddle Mountains reveal a steepening of bedding orientations below ~4 km depth (Pratt, 2012; Casale and Pratt, 2015)

Results from borehole BN 1–9, drilled at the hinge of the Crest anticline (Czajkowski et al., 2012), indicate that the change in bedding orientations may occur between the Eocene Roslyn Formation (48–45 Ma; Tabor et al., 1984; Miller et al., 2009; Cheney, 2014) and the overlying mid-Eocene Wenatchee Formation (>44.5–34[?] Ma; Tabor et al., 1984; Gilmour, 2012; Cheney, 2014)This may suggest that displacement was accommodated along the Saddle Mountains anticline and/or Saddle Mountains fault between mid-late Eocene and early Oligocene time

Folding of the Ringold Formation in the hanging wall of the Saddle Mountains fault suggests that N-S shortening across the Saddle Mountains fault likely continued into late Miocene–Pliocene time (Reidel, 1984)A paleoseismic study conducted along the Smyrna Bench provided evidence for Holocene deformation along the Saddle Mountains fault (West et al., 1996)

Steeper bed orientations in Eocene strata suggest pre-Miocene deformation on the Saddle Mountains anticline; however, the aeromagnetic data, isopach data, and the uniform shortening along each line-balanced layer suggest that the majority of deformation recorded in the Columbia River Basalt Group strata, and possibly the Oligocene strata, postdated the youngest basalt flow, the 10–10.5 Ma Elephant Mountain Member.While shortening in each balanced layer is uniform, the magnitude of slip increases with the age of the unit, from which we infer that the Saddle Mountains anticline is a fault-propagation fold (Suppe, 1985; Suppe and Medwedeff, 1990; Mitra, 1990), similar to other Yakima folds (Miller, 2014)

The onset of deformation likely predated the late Eocene–Oligocene deposition of the Fifes Peak/Ohanapecosh and Wenatchee Formations, based on the steepening of bedding orientations within the Roslyn Formation (Casale and Pratt, 2015)Based on the uniform magnitude of shortening preserved in post– Roslyn Formation strata, we infer that there was paucity of deformation from 45 Ma until at least 10 Ma along the Saddle Mountains anticline

Stratigraphic observations and tephra dating indicate that deposition of debris flows and mudflows continued throughout the late Miocene and into the Pliocene (until at least 3.5 Ma), which we interpret as continued anticlinal growth, relief generation, and hillslope erosion.Stratigraphic observations also allow us to characterize Miocene–Pliocene deformation along the Saddle Mountains anticline

However, several lines of evidence may suggest that the rate of defor mation currently accommodated along the Saddle Mountains anticline is greater than the long-term trend determined from Miocene strata.Paleoseismic work along the Saddle Mountains suggests that the late Quaternary to modern rate of slip along the Saddle Mountains fault is between 0.33 and 0.65 mm yr–1 (West et al., 1996), i.e., ~2–3 times greater than our calculated rate since 6.8 Ma, and, accordingly, ~24 percent–30 percent of the geodetic rate (McCaffrey et al., 2016)
