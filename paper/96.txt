A case study from southern Utah demonstrates that Upper Cretaceous (upper Santonian–Campanian) alluvial successions in the southernmost part of the Cordilleran foreland basin were deposited by fluvial systems of contrasting drainage directions and provenance, and suggests that different mechanisms governed their sequence architectureMost of the rivers flowed northeast, subparallel to the basin foredeep
Much research in foreland-basin sequence stratigraphy has addressed the characteristics of Upper Cretaceous continental strata in central and southern Utah (e.g., Shanley and McCabe 1991, 1995; Hettinger et al1993; Olsen et al
In the southernmost part of the Cordilleran foreland basin, petrology and paleocurrents of Upper Cretaceous fluvial strata reveal that architecturally similar fluvial deposits vary fundamentally in terms of their sources and dispersal directionsWe consider these variations in the context of tectonic basin models to evaluate driving mechanisms of sequence architecture in this foreland basin.
First, Upper Santonian–Campanian strata of southern Utah are exposed along a major west–east, thrust belt-to-basin transect (Fig1)
Upper Cretaceous strata of southwestern Utah were deposited in the southernmost preserved extent of the Cordilleran foreland basinThe strata
The strata are bounded to the west by Late Cretaceous thrust structures, and on the south by an erosional edgeTo the east, Upper Cretaceous strata were eroded from Laramide uplifts in the Paleocene (Goldstrand 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994; Goldstrand et al
To the east, Upper Cretaceous strata were eroded from Laramide uplifts in the Paleocene (Goldstrand 1990, 1991, 1992, 1994; Goldstrand et al1993)
On the north, they are covered by Paleogene–Neogene sedimentary and volcanic rocks.Coarse-grained Upper Cretaceous strata crop out in ranges west of the Hurricane fault, where they are extensively deformed by thrust-related faulting and folding of the Sevier orogenic belt (Fig
Coarse-grained Upper Cretaceous strata crop out in ranges west of the Hurricane fault, where they are extensively deformed by thrust-related faulting and folding of the Sevier orogenic belt (Fig1; Mackin 1947; Armstrong 1968; Hintze 1986; Maldonado and Williams 1993; Goldstrand and Mullet 1997)
The westernmost Wah Wah thrust sheet contains Proterozoic–lower Paleozoic quartzite, and the Blue Mountain thrust sheet to the east is composed of Cambrian through Pennsylvanian carbonate strata (Armstrong 1968; Fillmore 1991)Clasts of Precambrian–lower Paleozoic quartzite and Paleozoic chert and limestone indicate that much of the Cretaceous section was derived from rocks in the Wah Wah and Blue Mountain thrust sheets (Fillmore 1991; Goldstrand 1991)
Clasts of Precambrian–lower Paleozoic quartzite and Paleozoic chert and limestone indicate that much of the Cretaceous section was derived from rocks in the Wah Wah and Blue Mountain thrust sheets (Fillmore 1991; Goldstrand 1991)The Iron Springs thrust sheet consists of Cambrian through Jurassic rocks thrust over the Upper Cretaceous Iron Springs Formation sometime before deposition of the Paleocene Grand Castle Formation (Fig
The Iron Springs thrust sheet consists of Cambrian through Jurassic rocks thrust over the Upper Cretaceous Iron Springs Formation sometime before deposition of the Paleocene Grand Castle Formation (Fig2; Van Kooten 1988; Goldstrand 1991; Fillmore 1991; Maldonado and Williams 1993; Goldstrand and Mullett 1997; Nichols 1997).
Directly east of Cedar City, in the footwall of the Hurricane fault, the north-northeast-trending Kanarra fold involves strata as young as the Upper Cretaceous (Santonian) Straight Cliffs Formation (Averitt and Threet 1973)The Claron Formation postdates folding
East of the Kanarra fold, abundant tight, north-trending folds are present in evaporite and shale of the Upper Jurassic Carmel Formation, whereas the overlying Dakota Formation is largely unfolded, indicating structural detachment between Jurassic and Cretaceous strata during the Late Cretaceous.Upper Cretaceous strata are exposed almost continuously from the Hurricane fault to the eastern side of the Kaiparowits Plateau
Upper Cretaceous strata are exposed almost continuously from the Hurricane fault to the eastern side of the Kaiparowits PlateauIn this region, the strata are separated into three physiographic and geologic domains, the Markagunt, Paunsaugunt, and Kaiparowits plateaus, by Neogene normal faults (Fig
In this region, the strata are separated into three physiographic and geologic domains, the Markagunt, Paunsaugunt, and Kaiparowits plateaus, by Neogene normal faults (Fig1)
The Upper Cretaceous section consists mostly of continental rocks, but there are marine and estuarine intervals in the section that permit its division into four major, eastward-thinning, progradational successions (Fig2): (1) the Dakota Formation; (2) the marine Tropic Shale and overlying Straight Cliffs Formation; (3) the Wahweap Formation; and (4) the Kaiparowits Formation
Overlying the Kaiparowits Formation are conglomerate, sandstone, and mudstone of latest Campanian(?)–early Eocene age assigned to the Canaan Peak, Grand Castle, and Pine Hollow formations (Fig2; Bowers 1972; Eaton 1991; Goldstrand et al
The Eocene Claron Formation, consisting of limestone, calcareous sandstone and mudstone, and minor conglomerate, unconformably overlies older units ranging from the Straight Cliffs through the Pine Hollow formations (Bowers 1972, 1990; Goldstrand 1991; Goldstrand and Mullet 1997).Fluvial strata discussed in this paper include the Drip Tank Member of the Straight Cliffs Formation, the Wahweap Formation, the Kaiparowits Formation, and their equivalents (Fig
These strata range in age from latest Santonian to late Campanian in the Kaiparowits Plateau, but their correlation and distribution west of the Paunsaugunt fault remain incompletely understoodDifficulties in correlation arise from a variety of factors, including lateral facies changes within lithostratigraphic units, recycling of palynomorphs from older Upper Cretaceous strata, and inadequate local calibration of different biostratigraphic data sets that include palynomorphs, marine invertebrates, and mammalian fossils
Difficulties in correlation arise from a variety of factors, including lateral facies changes within lithostratigraphic units, recycling of palynomorphs from older Upper Cretaceous strata, and inadequate local calibration of different biostratigraphic data sets that include palynomorphs, marine invertebrates, and mammalian fossilsTherefore, correlations reported here must be regarded as preliminary and subject to change as more biostratigraphic data become available
(1994) for the Cretaceous time interval.The Drip Tank Member is a conspicuous interval of amalgamated, multistory sandstone and pebbly sandstone with trough and planar cross-beds (Eaton 1991; Little 1995; Shanley and McCabe 1995)
Near Webster Flat, the Drip Tank lies 100 m stratigraphically above a biotite tuff with a late Coniacian 40Ar/39Ar age (86.72 10.58 Ma; Eaton et al2001)
Pebbles as much as 2.5 cm in diameter are present in lags and dispersed on foresets, and consist of banded gray chert and dark gray chert with Paleozoic fossilsThe member generally thickens northward across the Paunsaugunt and Kaiparowits plateaus (Peterson 1969b; Tilton 1991; Eaton 1991)
The Drip Tank Member is latest Santonian in the Kaiparowits PlateauIn the central part of the Kaiparowits Plateau, it overlies upper Santonian
In the central part of the Kaiparowits Plateau, it overlies upper SantonianFIG
4.—Paleocurrent maps for late Santonian–Campanian fluvial systemsA) Drip Tank Member of Straight Cliffs Formation
At Henrieville Creek, the lower part of the Drip Tank contains palynomorphs of the middle Coniacian–latest Santonian Proteacidites retusus Zone (Nichols 1995, 1997)It correlates with the Emery Sandstone Member of the Mancos Shale in central Utah (Fig
The Wahweap Formation spans the early–middle Campanian (Fig2)
The lower three members are early to middle Campanian on the basis of mammalian vertebrate fossils (Eaton 1991; Eaton et al1999) and our preliminary palynomorph data (Fig
At Webster Flat, a palynomorph assemblage contains Dyadonapites reticulatus, whose first appearance in the Western Interior is middle Campanian (Nichols 1994)At Henrieville Creek and Wahweap Canyon, the capping sandstone member contains Aquilapollenites reductus, which first appears in the Western Interior in the latest middle Campanian (Nichols et al
At Henrieville Creek and Wahweap Canyon, the capping sandstone member contains Aquilapollenites reductus, which first appears in the Western Interior in the latest middle Campanian (Nichols et al1982; Nichols 1994)
At Paradise Canyon, Aquilapollenites clarireticulatus, a middle Campanian palynomorph (Nichols and Sweet 1993), is present at the base of the capping sandstone memberThe Wahweap therefore correlates with the Blackhawk and Castlegate formations of central Utah (Fig.2).
On the basis of petrology and stratigraphic position above a middle Campanian palynomorph assemblage, we correlate quartzose sandstone at the top of the Cretaceous section at Webster Flat in the western Markagunt Plateau with the capping sandstone member (Fig3)
This unit has also been assigned to the Grand Castle Formation (Goldstrand and Mullet 1997), which is Paleocene in the Table Cliffs Plateau.In the Paunsaugunt Plateau, an unconformity beneath the Eocene Claron Formation locally truncates much of the Wahweap Formation
In the Paunsaugunt Plateau, an unconformity beneath the Eocene Claron Formation locally truncates much of the Wahweap FormationThe entire Wahweap Formation was eroded from the crest of the Bryce Canyon anticline, which parallels the Paunsaugunt fault, prior to deposition of the Claron (Fig
Preliminary palynomorph TABLE 1.—Point-counting parameters* data indicate that Maastrichtian strata may also be present beneath theFIG
8.—Detrital modes of late Santonian–Campanian sandstones, Kaiparowits PlateauPetrofacies fields are indicated by shaded regions, which were drawn by inspection
Campanian sandstones of the study area fall into four natural compositional categories, or petrofacies (Fig8; e.g., Dickinson and Rich 1972; Dickinson et al
We infer a late Paleozoic carbonate source, perhaps the Kaibab Limestone, for these silty chert grainsCarbonate extrabasinal grains dominate the Lsm fraction, usually constituting more than 50 percent of the sedimentary lithic grains
Pebbles within late Santonian–Campanian strata were derived almost exclusively from sedimentary sourcesPebble counts in the capping sandstone
9.—Detrital modes of Upper Cretaceous sandstones, Markagunt (solid symbols) and Paunsaugunt (open symbols) plateausPetrofacies and provenance fields are from Figure 8
These pebble types have been attributed to uplifted Precambrian and Paleozoic strata of the Wah Wah and Blue Mountain thrust sheets, respectively (Table 2; Fillmore 1991; Goldstrand 1991, 1992)Clast populations in the Drip Tank Member in the Paunsaugunt and Markagunt plateaus are indistinguishable from those of the capping sandstone member, except that Drip Tank pebbles have a minor, local component of volcanic clasts (0–5 percent; Eaton et al
Modal compositions and pebble content indicate that the late Santonian– Campanian river systems tapped both supracrustal and basement sources to the west, southwest, and southLong-distance transport and confluent drainage systems are inferred to have resulted in mixing of detritus from these two sources to yield the observed petrofacies types
Similar compositions have been attributed to thrust-belt sources to the southwest that contributed sedimentary detritus, including radiolarian chert, and to the south-southwest in southeastern California, where basement and Jurassic silicic volcanic rocks are present in thrust sheets (Goldstrand 1992)Uplifted sedimentary rocks of the thrust belt likely contributed the abundant Qm and chert that cause this petrofacies to plot outside the continental-block (uplifted-basement) provenance field of Dickinson and Suczek (1979) and Dickinson (1985)
Similar feldspathic detritus in slightly older Turonian rocks of the study area has in fact been attributed to basement sources in southern Arizona (Elder and Kirkland 1994).The feldspatholithic petrofacies, with its distinctive high volcanic-lithic content, was derived from sources to the south
These grain types in the Kaiparowits and Canaan Peak formations were probably derived from upper Middle Jurassic ash-flow tuffs uplifted on the Maria and Mule Mountains thrust systems, active from about 80 to 65 Ma, of southwestern Arizona and southeastern California (e.g., Tosdal 1990; Miller et al1992; Richard et al
Radiolarian chert grains and other indicators of Paleozoic sedimentary source rocks may record a Sevier thrust belt provenance (Goldstrand 1992, 1994); however, the abundant sedimentary lithic grains and upper Paleozoic chert grains are also compatible with a sedimentary source stratigraphically beneath the Jurassic volcanic rocks in southern Arizona and southeastern California.The chert-rich quartzolithic petrofacies was derived primarily from the Sevier thrust belt and transported by tributaries to the major longitudinal rivers (Fig
Detritus came primarily from uplifted Mesozoic strata near the tip of the thrust belt, where the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone contributed the abundant large spherical Qm grains (Pollock 1999); older foreland-basin strata, mainly the Iron Springs Formation, may have likewise contributed quartz-rich detritusThe Dakota and Iron Springs formations are the primary sources for recycled Cenomanian–Turonian palynomorphs in the capping sandstone member
The Dakota and Iron Springs formations are the primary sources for recycled Cenomanian–Turonian palynomorphs in the capping sandstone memberWe interpret the Kanarra fold and Iron Springs thrust system as important sources of sediment for the capping sandstone member
Northeastward dispersal of detritus parallel to structural strike of the thrust orogen and foreland basin was the dominant transport mode of late Santonian–Campanian river systems in southwestern UtahThese systems are readily recognizable by their feldspar content, volcanic lithic detritus, and paleocurrent orientations
gests that partitioning of the foreland basin began in the middle CampanianAbrupt thinning at the East Kaibab monocline demonstrates that Campanian offset on the structure was opposite to its Laramide displacement, which was up to the west (Tindall and Davis 1999)
Abrupt thinning at the East Kaibab monocline demonstrates that Campanian offset on the structure was opposite to its Laramide displacement, which was up to the west (Tindall and Davis 1999)This syndepositional displacement failed to deflect the fluvial system, which apparently cut across intrabasinal structures composed of unconsolidated material.
In support of its eustatic origin, the sequence boundary at the base of the Drip Tank Member has been correlated with a global eustatic lowstand in the early Campanian (Shanley and McCabe 1995)The foredeep-parallel shift of the lowstand river system is thus inferred to have tracked a northeastward withdrawal of the sea in central Utah, recorded there by progradation of the Emery Sandstone Member of the Mancos Shale (Fig
However, if the lower Campanian of the Western Interior correlates with the global upper Santonian (e.g., Leahy and Lerbekmo 1995), the eustatic sub-Drip Tank unconformity will have to be recorrelated with a different eustatic lowstand.We regard the incongruent capping sandstone member as the record of a basinward shift created by active structural advance of the wedge-top depozone into the former foredeep rather than post-tectonic isostatic uplift (Fig
Involvement of Straight Cliffs strata in the Kanarra fold and truncation of the fold beneath the Claron Formation (Averitt and Threet 1973) indicate that folding took place between the end of the Santonian and the EoceneSecond, abrupt eastward thinning of the capping sandstone member across the East Kaibab monocline records non-uniform flexural subsidence, in this case, down-to-the-west displacement on an intra-foreland basement structure, during active thrust loading
The Santonian–Campanian fluvial systems evolved within an eastwardadvancing foreland-basin system (Eaton and Nations 1991; Little 1995; Eaton et al1997)
10B); however, confirmation of our reconstruction requires more study of Upper Cretaceous strata east of the Circle Cliffs uplift.The thick Kaiparowits Formation occupied a post-Wahweap foredeep
Late Santonian–Campanian fluvial systems of the southernmost Cordilleran foreland basin were dominantly longitudinal trunk rivers that flowed northeast along the foredeep, parallel to the strike of the Sevier thrust orogen.Less common east-southeast-directed, transverse dispersal systemsdeposited amalgamated sheet sandstone units in the basin
