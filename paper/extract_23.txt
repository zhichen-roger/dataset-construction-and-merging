Numerous researchers have postulated that northern India was involved in ophiolite obduction, arc–continent, or continent–continent collision during the Late Cretaceous or Early Paleocene, but firm geological evidence was never producedIn this article we argue against orogenic events predating the Late Paleocene, when the Neotethys Ocean was still open

Ophiolite obduction did take place around the Cretaceous/Paleocene boundary along the western transform margin of the Indian Plate (Gnos et al., 1998; Beck et al., 1996; Khan and Clyde, 2013), but this well documented event does not automatically imply that ophiolites were obducted at the same time onto the northern Indian margin as well (Rowley, 1996 p5)

The earliest tholeiitic lavas were erupted at 67 Ma in the north of the Deccan province, whereas the most voluminous eruptions correspond broadly in time with the Cretaceous/ Paleocene boundary at 66 Ma (Hofmann et al., 2000; Chenet et al., 2007; Keller et al., 2011)The thick lava pile shows southward overstepping by progressively younger units, and magmatism was younger by some 1–2 Ma in the southwest (Jerram and Widdowson, 2005)

Multifold increase in clastic supply from continental India during the Maastrichtian has no more plausible cause than enhanced erosion promoted by tectonic uplift associated with upwelling magmasEqually evident is the perfect coincidence in time between the ubiquitous latest Danian transgression along the Tethys Himalaya and the onset of rapid thermal subsidence while India drifted away from the Seychelles block and Deccan magmatism eventually ceased.

Hardgrounds and appearance of macrofossils in Santonian pelagic limestones of Zanskar and Spiti suggest that surface swelling might have started here as early as ~85 Ma, almost 20 Ma before the climax of Deccan volcanismAlternatively, this Santonian event may reflect an earlier distinct episode of dynamic uplift, associated with the separation of the India–Seychelles block from Madagascar and onset of spreading and volcanism in the Mascarene Basin (Bernard and Munschy, 2000; Torsvik et al., 2000; Calvès et al., 2011).
