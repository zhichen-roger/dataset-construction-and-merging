Topographic growth in parts of the central Lhasa terrane began in the earliest Albian (e.g., Damxung area; Wang et al., 2017), where rapid erosional exhumation started to feed the Xigaze forearc basin at the southern edge of the southern Lhasa terrane (An et al., 2014; Orme and Laskowski, 2016).Deposition of the Jingzhushan and  Daxiong alluvial conglomerate belts, documenting retreat of the seaway and provenance of d etritus from the Northern Lhasaplano took place around 92 Ma

Despite the lack of paleoelevation estimates for the Northern Lhasaplano, an Andean­style Tibetan plateau model is favored by stable­isotope data from carbonates in the Lhasa terrane, indicating high elevation already in the Paleocene–Eocene (Ding et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015; Ingalls et al., 2017)The Andes, however, do not have a continental collision zone in its foreland, whereas the Lhasa block was affected not only by oceanic subduction in the south but also by Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous collision with Qiangtang in the north (Girardeau et al., 1984; Zhu et al., 2016; Bian et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2017)
