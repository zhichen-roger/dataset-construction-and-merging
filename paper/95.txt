U–Pb laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry dating of detrital zircons from late Palaeozoic DevonoCarboniferous clastic units in the South Portuguese Zone and Pulo do Lobo Zone yield contrasting age populations and attest to the exotic nature of both zonesDetrital zircons from the South Portuguese Zone display populations typical of detritus derived from either Gondwana (Ossa–Morena Zone), or periGondwanan terranes
In contrast, rocks from the Pulo do Lobo Zone contain populations consistent with derivation from Baltica, Laurentia or recycled early Silurian deposits along the Laurentian marginAn example of one such deposit is the Southern Uplands terrane of the British Caledonides
Taken together, these data can be reconciled by a model involving tectonic transport of a crustal fragment that was laterally equivalent to the Southern Uplands terrane between the allochthonous South Portuguese Zone and Gondwana as a result of an early Devonian collision between an Iberian indenter with Laurussia.Supplementary material: U–Pb data tables, concordia diagrams, methods and representative back-scattered electron images are available at http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/SUP18441.
The Appalachian–Caledonide–Variscan orogens were produced by (1) the Ordovician–Silurian accretion of peri-Gondwanan terranes (e.gGanderia, Avalonia, Meguma) to Laurentia, which resulted in closure of the Iapetus Ocean, followed by (2) the Carboniferous closure of the Rheic  Palaeotethys oceans and ensuing terminal collision between Gondwana and Laurussia (e.g
Ganderia, Avalonia, Meguma) to Laurentia, which resulted in closure of the Iapetus Ocean, followed by (2) the Carboniferous closure of the Rheic  Palaeotethys oceans and ensuing terminal collision between Gondwana and Laurussia (e.gvan Staal et al
The former continuity of these belts was sundered in the early Mesozoic by the opening of the Atlantic OceanAs a result, many of the suture zones, particularly those that formed by consumption of the Rheic Ocean during Pangaea amalgamation, were either destroyed or are hidden beneath the Atlantic continental shelves.
The Pulo do Lobo Zone is an early to middle Devonian polydeformed tectonic me´lange of oceanic metasediments and olistostromal phacoid quartzites unconformably overlain by a simply deformed Vise´an flysch sequence(Eden 1991; Giese et al
Avalonia and Meguma are among several terranes collectively known as peri-Gondwanan, which originated along the northern Gondwanan margin in the Neoproterozoic but lay along the southern flank of Laurussia by the middle Devonian as a result of the closure of the Iapetus Ocean (van Staal et al1998, 2009; Murphy & Nance 2002; Fig
To further investigate the processes associated with the formation and evolution of this putative Pangaean suture zone, we sampled the clastic metasedimentary rocks and phacoid quartzites in the Pulo do Lobo Zone and the late Devonian metasedimentary rocks in the South Portuguese Zone and present laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) U– Pb analyses of detrital zircons from these samplesOur data provide new insights into the timing of collision between Gondwana and Laurussia and demonstrate that the Pulo do Lobo Zone me´lange and metasedimentary rocks are not simply derived from the flanking Laurussian or Gondwanan margins
To account for the detrital zircon populations in the Pulo do Lobo Zone we propose derivation from a crustal fragment, which escaped laterally as the result of an early Devonian collision between an Iberian indenter (Gondwana) (Dias & Ribeiro 1995) and LaurussiaOur model not only provides a method for emplacement of the Pulo do Lobo Zone but also potentially explains genetic linkages between enigmatic voluminous magmatism and widespread mineralization in both the Meguma terrane of the Northern Appalachians and the Iberian Pyrite Belt of the South Portuguese Zone not accounted for in other models.
The oldest exposed units in the South Portuguese Zone are late Devonian continental shelf strata of the Phyllite Quartzite GroupThe Phyllite Quartzite Group is composed of siliciclastic prevolcanic rocks deposited in a subtidal environment from fan delta and sand bar systems on a shallow marine continental platform (Moreno & Sa´ez 1990; Oliveira 1990; Moreno et al
The Phyllite Quartzite Group is conformably overlain by the late Famennian–late Vise´an (Oliveira 1990) bimodal volcanic and sedimentary successions of the Volcano-Sedimentary Complex deposited in a transtensional basin (Schermerhorn 1971; Rosa et al2008)
The VolcanoSedimentary Complex is in turn overlain by a late Vise´an to the Serpukhovian turbiditic flysch group (Schermerhorn 1971; Oliveira 1990; Fig1b).
The protolith ages of the Pulo do Lobo Zone are constrained by Givetian–Frasnian palynomorphs (Ribeira de Limas formation) and late Devonian–early Carboniferous spores and acritarchs in the flysch deposits (Santa Iria Flysch) (Oliveira et al1986; Giese et al
In the late Palaeozoic, regional late Devonian to early Carboniferous south–southeasterly propagating (e.gQuesada 1998) deformation in the South Portuguese Zone occurred as a result of northward-directed oblique (sinistral) subduction of the Rheic Ocean lithosphere beneath the Ossa–Morena Zone (Gondwana) (Crespo-Blanc & Orozco 1988; Quesada 1998)
The Pulo do Lobo Zone also preserves evidence of this pervasive late Devonian regional sinistral shear, compartmentalized within the Pulo do Lobo formation, the Ribeira de Limas formation and the Ala´jar Me´lange (Braid et al2010)
To investigate the development of this putative suture zone, six samples were collected for detrital zircons from Devonian to early Carboniferous units of the Pulo do Lobo Zone and South Portuguese Zone (Fig1b)
We analysed one sample from the late Devonian passive margin quartzites (Phyllite Quartzite Group) from the South Portuguese Zone, to test the provenance of the South Portuguese Zone and its relationship to the Pulo do Lobo Zone; and two samples of phacoid quartzites and one sample of matrix from the me´lange deposits (Ala´jar Me´lange) and one sample of quartzwacke (Ribeira de Limas formation) from the Pulo do Lobo Zone (suture zone)The samples from the Pulo do Lobo Zone test the provenance of the Pulo do Lobo Zone and potential changes in sediment provenance in different lithotectonic units within the suture zone
We also analysed a sample of greywacke from the overlying late Devonian early Carboniferous flysch (Santa Iria Flysch) from the Pulo do Lobo Zone to investigate the potential changes in sediment provenance with proposed changes in tectonic environment.Approximately 65 zircon grains from each sample were mounted, polished, imaged by electron back-scatter, and analysed for their U and Pb isotopic composition (one analysis per zircon grain) by LA-ICPMS using an Thermo Element 2 high-resolution system coupled to a New Wave Research 213 nm Nd–YAG laser
A sample of quartzite (JB-17) was selected from the late Devonian continental shelf deposits (Phyllite Quartzite Group), which are considered the oldest exposed unit in the South Portuguese Zone properOf the 60 concordant analyses, only four grains (c

However, the presence of minor Mesoproterozoic zircons in the Phyllite Quartzite Group sample is not typical of derivation from West Africa but these are present in periGondwanan Avalonia and Meguma (Keppie et al1998)
In contrast, the dominant Mesoproterozoic (c1.0–1.5 Ga) and late Palaeoproterozoic populations (c
The Pulo do Lobo Zone samples also lack Neoproterozoic and early Palaeoproterozoic zircon populations, which are typically abundant in Neoproterozoic to Devonian units derived from Gondwana (e.gFerna´ndez-Sua´rez et al
Consequently, the age distributions of these samples suggest that the detritus in the Pulo do Lobo Zone was not derived from Gondwana (Ossa– Morena Zone), nor from the sources of the late Devonian clastic rocks (Phyllite Quartzite Group) of the South Portuguese Zone or peri-Gondwanan terranes that flanked the margin of Laurentia and Baltica in the Devono-Carboniferous.Taken together these interpretations suggest that the quartzite phacoids and matrix (Ala´jar me´lange) and metasediments (Ribeira de Limas formation) of the Pulo do Lobo Zone were derived from either Baltica or Laurentia
440 Ma zircons in the me´lange phacoids (RSA-01 and JB-43) suggests a local early Silurian volcanic sourceVolcanism of this age is rare in Gondwana but common along eastern Laurentia (e.g
Thus the Pulo do Lobo Zone sediments were not only derived from Laurentia and/or Baltica but also probably derived from early Silurian rocks associated with the closure of the Iapetus, along the eastern margin ofAn example of one such potential source is the early Silurian Southern Uplands terrane of the British Caledonides (Fig
An example of one such potential source is the early Silurian Southern Uplands terrane of the British Caledonides (Fig1a), which borders the Midland Valley terrane to the south
Most notably, similar to the detritus in the Pulo do Lobo Zone, detritus from the Southern Uplands terrane contains abundant Mesoproterozoic and late Palaeoproterozoic zircons as well as c440 Ma Palaeozoic zircons
Furthermore, the Southern Uplands terrane also lacks early Palaeoproterozoic and significant Neoproterozoic zirconsAs the Southern Uplands terrane has potential lateral equivalents in Newfoundland (Waldron et al
To a first order, the data suggest that during at least the early to middle Devonian the South Portuguese Zone was outboard of the Gondwanan margin (Ossa–Morena Zone)This interpretation is consistent with late Palaeozoic calc-alkaline andesitic arc magmatism present in the Ossa–Morena Zone (Jesus et al
Therefore the South Portuguese Zone basement is either a rifted Silurian West African ribbon continent that derived late Devonian passive margin clastic rocks from itself or peri-Gondwanan Meguma basement with Phyllite Quartzite Group clastic rocks sourced from the Meguma Group, which is dominated by c0.6–2.1 Ga detritus (Krogh & Keppie 1990; Waldron et al
However, the Phyllite Quartzite Group (JB-17) contains a paucity of Mesoproterozoic zircons (Fig3), the lack of which is generally considered a fingerprint of West African provenance (e.g
In addition, in view of the fact that (1) palaeogeographical reconstructions propose that the Meguma terrane was immediately outboard of the southern Iberia margin during the early Devonian (e.gMart´ınez-Catala´n et al
2003) and that (2) West Africa lacks Silurian– early Devonian rift to passive margin deposits that would reflect a separation of the South Portuguese Zone along the periphery of West Africa, we support the former scenario, in which the South Portuguese Zone basement is part of the peri-Gondwanan Meguma terrane.Timing of Ossa–Morena Zone and South Portuguese Zone collision
The detrital zircon signature of the flysch (Santa Iria Flysch) in the Pulo do Lobo Zone displays a broad range of Neoproterozoic to Palaeoproterozoic zircons consistent with derivation from sources located in Gondwana, peri-Gondwanan terranes and Laurussia (Fig3)
Taken together, the detrital zircon data from the Pulo do Lobo Zone and the South Portuguese Zone indicate that (1) the polydeformed Ala´jar me´lange and metasediments of the Pulo do Lobo Zone can all be assigned to the same tectonic environment (similar source), (2) the Pulo do Lobo Zone polydeformed sediments were not derived from the Ossa–Morena Zone or from the South Portuguese Zone during Devonian subduction of an oceanic basin beneath the Ossa–Morena Zone, (3) a source for the Pulo do Lobo Zone polydeformed deposits similar to the Southern Uplands Terrane of the British Caledonides is required, (4) the South Portuguese Zone is probably exotic with respect to both the Pulo do Lobo Zone and the Ossa–Morena Zone and contains late Devonian continental clastic rocks (Phyllite Quartzite Group) similar to the Devonian detritus from the Meguma terrane of the Northern Appalachians and (5) the South Portuguese Zone accreted to the Pulo do Lobo Zone and the Ossa– Morena Zone by c347 Ma, the age of the youngest concordant detrital zircon in the Pulo do Lobo Zone flysch (Santa Iria Flysch), which contains mixed zircon populations derived from all three crustal fragments .
Interpretation of a source equivalent to the Southern Uplands terrane for the Pulo do Lobo Zone requires either a substantial across-strike fluvial transport during the Devonian from a source NW of the peri-Gondwanan terranes (Avalonia, Meguma) or a tectonic transport of a crustal fragment along strike of the Southern Uplands to a location between the South Portuguese Zone and the Ossa–Morena ZoneIn our view, the latter scenario is favoured by (1) presence of c
440 Ma grains with a euhedral morphology, consistent with a short-lived sedimentary history, in both the quartzite phacoids and quartzite matrix, (2) the absence of peri-Gondwanan detritus in the Pulo do Lobo Zone samples that would be expected in a fluvial system extending from the Laurentian margin to a Devonian basin outboard of Gondwana and (3) our interpretation that both the polydeformed olistostromal phacoid quartzites (samples RSA-01 and JB-43) of the Ala´jar me´lange as well as the quartzite matrix (sample RSA-02) were derived from the same sourceThese factors favour a proximal source for the Pulo do Lobo Zone deposits over a distal fluvial derivation of zircon grains
Taken together, these data and interpretations suggest that the deposition of the Pulo do Lobo Zone units requires not only a source along the early Silurian Laurentian margin (Southern Uplands terrane?) but also the subsequent spatial juxtaposition of this source with the Ossa–Morena Zone, prior to c347 Ma (i.e
2004) or Iberia was part of the Armorican Composite Terrane, which separated from Gondwana during the Silurian and collided with Laurussia prior to its terminal collision with Gondwana (e.gVan der Voo 1979, 1982; Stampfli & Borel 2002)
Furthermore, the Ossa–Morena Zone records an early Ordovician to late Palaeozoic passive margin (Robardet & Gutie´rrez Marco 2004), which lacks Silurian rift to drift deposits predicted by an early Palaeozoic separation of an Armorican Composite Terrane from GondwanaTherefore in terms of understanding the enigmatic and contrasting Devono-Carboniferous evolution of the Pulo do Lobo Zone, South Portuguese Zone and Ossa–Morena Zone we adopt a reconstruction with a unified Iberia and Gondwana
Therefore in terms of understanding the enigmatic and contrasting Devono-Carboniferous evolution of the Pulo do Lobo Zone, South Portuguese Zone and Ossa–Morena Zone we adopt a reconstruction with a unified Iberia and GondwanaAlthough this choice may affect the details of our model, it does not affect the basic processes involved.
Using this general reconstruction, we propose that early Devonian oblique collision between an Iberian indenter and Laurussia and the existence of a small remnant ocean basin (reentrant) between southern Iberia, North Africa and the northern Appalachians resulted in tectonic escape of a crustal fragment correlative with the Southern Uplands of the British Caledonides across the remnant oceanThis escape was accommodated by development of a new subduction zone beneath the Ossa– Morena Zone (Fig

dextral early Devonian deformation along the Bristol Fault zone in SE England, (3) opposing sinistral deformation in the Southern Uplands of Scotland (Phillips et al1995) and the South Iberian Shear Zone (Crespo-Blanc & Orozco 1988) and other major lineaments (Quesada 1991) in southern Iberia (Fig
In this model, northwesterly subduction beneath Laurussia in the Late Silurian was disrupted by collision with the Iberian promontory of Gondwana such that oblique subduction with a sinistral component commenced beneath the Ossa–Morena ZoneThis subduction was accompanied by the generation of the sinistral South Iberian Shear Zone (Crespo-Blanc & Orozco 1988) and a tectonic free face (e.g
During the stages of tectonic escape, late Devonian passive margin deposits (Phyllite Quartzite Group), probably sourced from the Meguma terrane, were deposited on South Portuguese Zone basement, which was part of the escaping blockAs these are passive margin deposits they are probably only indicative of a local passive margin setting in basins within the escaping block
Following deposition of these continental clastic rocks, late Devonian–early Carboniferous extension occurred within the South Portuguese Zone, typical of internal deformation in escaping blocks (e.gMann 1997; see also the model by Castroviejo et al
This model is consistent with (1) documented dextral movement in the Meguma terrane relative to Avalonia in the northern Appalachians (Keppie & Dallmeyer 1987), (2) the late Devonian–early Carboniferous transtension required for bimodal volcanism (c355–330 Ma) of the Iberian Pyrite Belt (e.g
Although these connections are independent of the derivation of the Pulo do Lobo Zone they further support both a detrital zircon genetic linkage between the South Portuguese Zone and the Meguma terrane and a Devono-Carboniferous tectonic escape mechanism as the probable mode of transport for part of the Laurentian– Iapetan suture (Southern Uplands?) toward the Ossa–Morena Zone.The eventual juxtaposition of rocks from the Southern Uplands equivalent terrane with a Rheic subduction zone beneath the Ossa–Morena Zone (Fig
