This basin has been shown to have originated as a rift, presently spanning over an area of 300,000 km2, preserving 13 km of Mississippian to Eocene strata disrupted by numerous deformation events and unconformities (Balkwill, 1978; Trettin, 1991; Embry and Beauchamp, 2008).The Sverdrup Basin is the successor to the Franklinian Basin, which preserves a Neoproterozoic to Upper Devonian sedimentary record along the northern edge of Laurentia (Balkwill, 1978)

By the Middle Devonian Crockerland approached the Franklinian Basin, as evidenced by renewed deepening and widespread northwesterly derived sedimentation throughout the basin (Trettin, 1998)Final accretion of Crockerland against the Laurentian margin led to the latest Devonian Ellesmerian Orogeny and the deposition of molasse sediments, which blanketed northern Laurentia and are preserved as the Devonian Clastic Wedge (Thorsteinsson and Tozer, 1957; Embry, 1988, 1991; Patchett et al., 2004).

This first phase recorded three major pulses of rifting, coinciding with the Viséan, Serpukhovian, and Bashkirian sequences (Fig2) associated with deposition of synrift clastic, carbonate, and evaporite sediments covering an increasingly broader area with each subsequent pulse (Embry and Beauchamp, 2008).

Post-rift quiescence and thermal subsidence prevailed during most of the Pennsylvanian and Permian, punctuated by at least three basin inversion episodes from the latest Carboniferous to the early Permian (Fig2), collectively recognized as the Melvillian Disturbance (Thorsteinsson and Tozer, 1970; Stephenson et al., 1987; Beauchamp et al., 2001)

Multiple deformation events from the Gzhelian (late Late Pennsylvanian) to the Changhsingian (late Late Permian) were later recognized by Beauchamp et al(2001) and Beauchamp (2015), some involving half-graben inversion and normal faulting, suggesting more complex, possibly transpressive to transtensive, stress conditions during these pulses (Fig

As a result of these deformation episodes, passive thermal subsidence of the basin during the Carboniferous and Permian was overwhelmed by short episodes of fault-controlled subsidence, leading to the creation of numerous local depocenters and regional unconformities along both northern and southern basin margins (Stephenson et al., 1987; Beauchamp et al., 2001; Embry and Beauchamp, 2008).The first major unconformity resulting from these episodes is the subRoadian (sub-early Middle Permian) unconformity, recognized along both basin margins and in the subsurface (Thorsteinsson, 1974; Beauchamp et al., 2001)

Similar Middle Permian deformation and a transition from carbonate platform to siliciclastic sedimentation is also documented in the northern Barents Sea and Svalbard within the Tempelfjorden Group (Worsley, 2008), suggesting that these processes were regional in extent and not restricted to the Sverdrup Basin.The second major unconformity is the sub-Changhsingian (sub-late Late Permian) angular unconformity (Fig

On the southern margin of the Sverdrup Basin, lowermost Triassic strata of the Bjorne Formation record cratonic uplift that was synchronous with deformation events and uplifts on the northern margin (Embry and Beauchamp, 2008).Crockerland, which remained exposed throughout the Triassic to Middle Jurassic, underwent rifting and ultimately separated from the Laurentian margin by the Cretaceous, leading to the opening of the Amerasia Basin (Embry, 1993, 2009; Hadlari et al., 2016)

A recycled Silurian sedimentary source with minor contributions from recycled Devonian strata is also supported by the relatively small proportion of 400–350 Ma and 700–500 Ma grains in these samples, contrasting with their prominence in Devonian Clastic Wedge strata (Fig8) (Beranek et al., 2010; Anfinson et al., 2012a, 2012b)

These results indicate that during the late Pennsylvanian to Early Permian sediments that accumulated along both the northern and southern margins of the Sverdrup Basin were either derived from recycling of the Danish River Formation and other Franklinian Basin strata, or from the same ultimate sources, that is the East Greenland Caledonides, Pearya, and the Laurentian Shield (Anfinson et al., 2012a; Hadlari et al., 2014; Beranek et al., 2015)On the northern margin, the sampled units exhibit petrological characteristics typical of proximal derivation, such as a red weathering color, a narrow lateral extent of the red sandstone within the volcanic units (sample SvB-01), cobble-sized clasts and limited areal extent of the units on top of the Nansen and Raanes formations (SvB02 and SvB-03)

On the southern margin, Middle Permian sediments were deposited unconformably on the maximum flooding surface of the underlying Kungurian (uppermost Lower Permian) sequence, filling local depocenters created by an episode of basin inversion with small drainage areas and local reworking of sediment (Harrison, 1995; Embry and Beauchamp, 2008; Morris, 2013)Hence, based on the detrital zircon signature, facies, and stratigraphy of upper Pennsylvanian to Lower Permian strata of both basin margins it is likely that reworking of older units, particularly of Silurian age, was the main sediment source for these small depocenters.

Hence, based on the detrital zircon signature, facies, and stratigraphy of upper Pennsylvanian to Lower Permian strata of both basin margins it is likely that reworking of older units, particularly of Silurian age, was the main sediment source for these small depocenters.The absence of zircons yielding dates younger than 365 Ma in all of the upper Pennsylvanian and Lower Permian samples indicates that syndepositional volcanism in the area did not yield a significant number of zircons or that these zircons were not incorporated into the sampled units.

The prominence of the 1700–1600 Ma zircon sub-population can therefore be explained by derivation from more distal sources, such as the Sveconorwegian Orogen in the East Greenland Caledonides, reworking of Cambrian strata from northern Greenland, and reworking of Devonian Clastic Wedge strata with abundant grains of this age interval (Fig8) (Kirkland et al., 2009; Anfinson et al., 2012a)

However, some reworking of older strata is required to explain the small 700–500 Ma sub-population, which is present in the Roadian and Kungurian samples and proposed to have been originally derived from Timanian-aged basement in Crockerland and shed into the Franklinian Basin during the Devonian (Anfinson et al., 2012a).In contrast, detrital zircon signatures from Middle Permian to Lower Triassic sediments on northern Axel Heiberg Island point to a different source region, with some shared sub-populations with Devonian Clastic Wedge strata

The Middle Permian to Lower Triassic samples from northern Axel Heiberg Island also exhibit a spread of Permian dates between 295 and 250 Ma, a sub-population similar to that previously found in Lower Triassic samples from northern Axel Heiberg Island (Omma et al., 2011)It is important to note that relatively thick Permian to Triassic sandstone samples collected some 300–500 km to the southwest in the Isachsen J-37 (Ellef Ringnes Island) and Brock C-50 (Brock Island) wells (Fig

Thus, an active margin setting for the paleo-Pacific margin of Arctic Alaska–Chukotka should be considered, even preferred, when explaining the tectonic setting of the Sverdrup Basin and adjacent domains during the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic.A more complex reconstruction than a single subduction zone is required due to the discrepancies in the detrital zircon spectra between Lower Triassic strata in Chukotka–Wrangel Island and the Sverdrup Basin, which represent two distinct sources of near-depositional zircons

This newly created extensional regime in a backarc position could have induced the initiation of Sverdrup Basin subsidence, creating depocenters within the Laurentian margin and the terranes now incorporated within the Arctic Alaska–Chukotka Microplate, as indicated by the distinct geochronological signature of lower Paleozoic strata in various areas considered to be part of this landmass (Miller et al., 2010; Ershova et al., 2015c, 2016)Analogues of this proposed backarc-induced collapse of the Ellesmerian Orogen are also recognized along the Variscan Orogen, which led Ziegler (1988) to first propose that this mechanism was responsible for the onset of subsidence in the Sverdrup Basin.
