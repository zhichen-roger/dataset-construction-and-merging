Cenomanian rocks in the Sinai Peninsula, Northeast Egypt: Facies analysis and sequence stratigraphyGeology Department, Faculty of Science, Menoufyia University, Shebin El-Kom, Egypt
In Egypt, the Cenomanian rocks are widely exposed in Sinai and Eastern Desert, whereas subsurface equivalents occur in the Western Desert (Table 1)The marine facies of the Cenomanian rocks cover most of the northern part of Egypt, whereas the continental facies with shallow marine incursions characterize the Cenomanian rocks in the southern part of Egypt (Issawi et al., 1999)
The marine facies of the Cenomanian rocks cover most of the northern part of Egypt, whereas the continental facies with shallow marine incursions characterize the Cenomanian rocks in the southern part of Egypt (Issawi et al., 1999)In Sinai, most of the previous studies of the Cenomanian strata were focused on litho-and biostratigraphy (e.g., Fawzi, 1960; Cherif et al., 1989; Khalil, 1993; Ziko et al., 1993; Kora et al., 1994; Kora and Genedi, 1995; Bauer et al., 2001; Kassab and Obaidalla, 2001; Kora et al., 2001; Abdel-Shafy et al., 2002; Abdel-Gawad et al., 2004a,b and references therein).

A few localized studies of depositional facies and sequences of the Cenomanian strata have been carried out in north Sinai (Abdallah et al., 1996; El-Azabi and El-Araby, 1996; Bachmann and Kuss, 1998; El-Araby, 2002), west central Sinai (Khalifa et al., 2003), east central Sinai (Kora and Genedi, 1995) and southwest Sinai (Koraet al., 2001; Saber, 2002)
The present study focuses on the facies analysis, depositional environments and sequence stratigraphic framework of the Cenomanian rocks cropping out in Sinai, from south to north, and particularly at Gabal Ekma (southwest Sinai), Gabal Al-Makarah (southwest Sinai), Khashm El-Tarif (east central Sinai), Gabal El-Fallig (west central Sinai) and Gabal Manzour (north Sinai) (Fig1)
This approach makes it possible to follow the lateral facies changes and establish a depositional model for the Cenomanian strata in SinaiTo achieve this work, five stratigraphic sections of the Cenomanian rocks were measured, described and sampled
To achieve this work, five stratigraphic sections of the Cenomanian rocks were measured, described and sampledThe indurated rocks were thin-sectioned and investigated under the polarized microscope to illustrate and describe the microfacies types
In the mid- and Late Cretaceous times, the SinaiFig
In the mid-and Late Cretaceous times, the main phase of compressive tectonic activities related to the Syrian Arc System that was initiated at the Late Cenomanian time (Bartov and Steinitz, 1977; Kuss and Bachmann, 1996)Therefore, the study area (Sinai) is believed to have remained tectonically rather quiet throughout Cenomanian time (Kuss and Bachmann, 1996).
Therefore, the study area (Sinai) is believed to have remained tectonically rather quiet throughout Cenomanian time (Kuss and Bachmann, 1996).In Sinai, different formational names have been introduced for the Cenomanian rocks by different authors
In Sinai, different formational names have been introduced for the Cenomanian rocks by different authorsThe Cenomanian rocks were attributed to the ‘‘Raha Formation” (Ghorab, 1961), ‘‘Galala Formation” (Abdallah and El-Adindani, 1963) and ‘‘Halal Formation” (Said, 1971) in southwest central Sinai, east central Sinai and northern Sinai, respectively (Table 1)
The Cenomanian rocks were attributed to the ‘‘Raha Formation” (Ghorab, 1961), ‘‘Galala Formation” (Abdallah and El-Adindani, 1963) and ‘‘Halal Formation” (Said, 1971) in southwest central Sinai, east central Sinai and northern Sinai, respectively (Table 1)Issawi et al
(1999) reported that the Halal Formation is a localized facies; hence they named the Cenomanian beds in Sinai as the Galala FormationIn the present study, because the Cenomanian rocks throughout Sinai display facies and paleoenvironmental changes, the author prefers to use the term Raha/Galala/Halal formations to describe the Cenomanian rocks from south through central to north of Sinai, respectively (Table 1)
In the present study, because the Cenomanian rocks throughout Sinai display facies and paleoenvironmental changes, the author prefers to use the term Raha/Galala/Halal formations to describe the Cenomanian rocks from south through central to north of Sinai, respectively (Table 1)Boundaries of the Cenomanian Raha/Galala/Halal formations differ in their characters throughout the studied localities
Boundaries of the Cenomanian Raha/Galala/Halal formations differ in their characters throughout the studied localitiesAt Gabal Ekma, Gabal Al-Makarah and Gabal Khashm El-Tarif, the Raha/Galala formations unconformably overlie the Barremian-Aptian Malha Formation
At Gabal Ekma, Gabal Al-Makarah and Gabal Khashm El-Tarif, the Raha/Galala formations unconformably overlie the Barremian-Aptian Malha FormationAt these localities, the lower contact of the Raha/Galala formations are distinguished by the occurrence of ferruginous crust and iron-filled vertical pipes that invade downward in the reddish white sandstones of the underlying Barremian-Aptian Malha Formation (Figs
At these localities, the lower contact of the Raha/Galala formations are distinguished by the occurrence of ferruginous crust and iron-filled vertical pipes that invade downward in the reddish white sandstones of the underlying Barremian-Aptian Malha Formation (Figs2 and 3)
At Gabal El-Fallig and Gabal Manzour, the lower boundary of the Halal Formation made conformable relationship with the underlying Abtian–Albian Risan Aneiza FormationIt is located at the first appearance of the typical Ceno-
At all the studied localities, the upper boundary of the Cenomanian Raha/Galala/Halal formations are conformably overlain by the ammonite-rich marls/calcareous shales of the Upper Cenomanian-Lower Turonian Abu Qada Formation (Figs2 and 3)
From the lithological point of view, the Cenomanian rocks exhibit significance lateral and vertical changes from south to north of the study area (Figs2 and 3)
2 and 3), which can be correlated with other published subdivisions of the Cenomanian rock units as shown in Table 1The lower unit is a mixed clastic–carbonate facies, in which the clastic facies is dominated and becomes increasingly abundant in the southern parts of the study area
In general, the Cenomanian rocks of Sinai show a southward decrease in thickness accompanied by an increase in siliciclastic componentsThe northern- and northeastern parts of Sinai experienced relatively high carbonate production (Figs
Twenty-four sedimentary facies of both clastic and carbonate rocks are recognized in the studied Cenomanian rocksThese facies are grouped in seven facies associations that are assignable to five depositional environments (peritidal, lagoon, high-energy shoals of ooids and patch reefs, and intertidal–subtidal to storm-influenced open marine)
Therefore, the dominance of the stratified deposits of rudist boundstone facies in the Cenomanian succession at Gabal El-Fallig can be belonged to a rudist patch reef of high-energy intertidal shoal environmentThis facies may represent the organic reef of the platform margin.
In addition, the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous tectonic movements led to establishment of a progressively northward subsiding passive margin in Sinai, which represents a substrate for the Cenomanian deposits (Shata, 1956)Moreover, the tectonic movements were negligible and excluded during Cenomanian time in Sinai (Ayyad and Darwish, 1996; Kuss and Bachmann 1996)
Moreover, the tectonic movements were negligible and excluded during Cenomanian time in Sinai (Ayyad and Darwish, 1996; Kuss and Bachmann 1996)On the basis of the fore-mentioned and following the classification of carbonate platform of Read (1985) and Burchette and Wright (1992), the author assumes that the studied sediments probably deposited in a homoclinal ramp setting rather than a rimmed shelf
In this study, although the mid-ramp Cenomanian facies cannot be followed laterally over longer distances, they seem to have been extended toward the extreme north of the study area where hemipelagic facies of outer-ramp and basin sediments (e.g., planktonic forams-rich limestones, marls and chalks) were encountered in the subsurface sections in the extreme north of Sinai (Ayyad and Darwish, 1996) and Israel (Lepson-Benitah et al., 1997) (Fig8)
towards the close of the Cenomanian time by a rapid sea-level rise controlling the deposition of the Abu Qada Formation in Sinai (Cherif et al., 1989; Khalifa et al., 2003; Kora and Genedi, 1995; Saber, 2002).The major tectonic movements were negligible and excluded during Cenomanian time in Sinai (Kuss and Bachmann, 1996; Ayyad and Darwish, 1996)
The major tectonic movements were negligible and excluded during Cenomanian time in Sinai (Kuss and Bachmann, 1996; Ayyad and Darwish, 1996)Consequently and among the various factors control sedimentation patterns of mixed clastic–carbonate ramps (Tucker, 1990; Schlager, 2005 for review), the author proposes eustatic sea-level changes in a combination with the paleo-relief of substrate (ramp) and environmental factors (e.g., carbonate biological productivity and siliciclastic input) were the major factors controlling the vertical and lateral facies changes between the sedimentary sequences in the studied localities
This boundary represents the base of the Cenomanian successionAt Gabal Ekma, Gabal Al-Makarah and Gabal Khashm El-Tarif, it is traced between the shallow marine mixed clastic–carbonate deposits of the basal part of the Cenomanian Raha/Galala Formation and the fluvial clastics of the underlying Barremian-Aptian Malha Formation (Figs
At Gabal Ekma, Gabal Al-Makarah and Gabal Khashm El-Tarif, it is traced between the shallow marine mixed clastic–carbonate deposits of the basal part of the Cenomanian Raha/Galala Formation and the fluvial clastics of the underlying Barremian-Aptian Malha Formation (Figs2 and 3)
At Gabal El-Fallig and Gabal Manzour, although no criteria of hardground or subaerial exposure are noticed between the Halal Formation and its underlying Risan Aneiza Formation, the first sequence boundary (SB1) is noticed between the dolomicrite of the uppermost bed of the Aptian–Albian Risan Aneiza Formation and the highly fossiliferous marls of the lowermost part of the Cenomanian Halal Formation (Figs2 and 3)
This is similar to that described in the sequence boundaries in the Jurassic and Cretaceous shallow-marine carbonate platform of France, Spain and Oman by Hillgärtner (1998), Molina et al(1999) and Immenhauser et al
On the basis of their stratigraphic setting, facies changes and sequence boundaries and surfaces, the studied Cenomanian rocks (Raha/Galala/Halal formations) display the occurrence of two depositional sequences formed in response to eustatic sea-level changes (Figs2 and 3).
(1988), transgressive surface (TS2) is detected where the quiet water, deep subtidal open marine facies of the Lower Turonian Abu Qada Formation drowned above the late HST of mixed siliciclastic carbonate, inner-mid ramp of the Cenomanian succession at all the studied localities, without remarkable subaerial exposure or lowstand deposits (Figs2 and 3)
Five stratigraphic sections of the Cenomanian rocks (Raha/Galala/Halal formations) have been measured and studied in SinaiThis has been done to deduce the depositional environments and establish the sequence stratigraphic framework of the Cenomanian rocks in Sinai
This has been done to deduce the depositional environments and establish the sequence stratigraphic framework of the Cenomanian rocks in SinaiThe studied Cenomanian successions are characterized by siliciclastic/carbonate deposits, in which the siliciclastic components increase toward the southern parts of Sinai with decreasing carbonate deposits
The studied Cenomanian successions are characterized by siliciclastic/carbonate deposits, in which the siliciclastic components increase toward the southern parts of Sinai with decreasing carbonate depositsThe Cenomanian rocks are subdivided into three informal rock units: lower, middle and upper
The Cenomanian rocks are subdivided into three informal rock units: lower, middle and upperWithin the Cenomanian rocks, different clastic and carbonates facies have been differentiated according to their texture and composition
Within the Cenomanian rocks, different clastic and carbonates facies have been differentiated according to their texture and compositionDifferent depositional environments that have been recognized in these rocks include peritidal flat, lagoon, high-energy shoals of ooids and rudist patch reef and intertidal–subtidal to storm-influenced open marine
The facies and their related depositional environments indicate that the Cenomanian rocks in Sinai were deposited on a ramp settingThis ramp shows a gradual southwest-northward transition from inner-to mid-ramp
In general, the Cenomanian facies characteristics show a gradual northward increase in open marine carbonate facies with simultaneous southward increase in shallow marine clastic faciesThe present study proposes that eustatic sea-level change coincided with environmental factors (e.g., carbonate production and siliciclastic supply) are the main factors controlling deposition of the Cenomanian deposits in Sinai.
The present study proposes that eustatic sea-level change coincided with environmental factors (e.g., carbonate production and siliciclastic supply) are the main factors controlling deposition of the Cenomanian deposits in Sinai.Relying on distribution and stacking pattern of the recognized facies and their related paleo-environments, two superimposed depositional sequences were distinguished
In conclusion, the present study declares that the transgression of the Neo-Tethys in Sinai during Cenomanian came from the north toward the south.The University of Menoufiya provided financial support during the completion of this work
