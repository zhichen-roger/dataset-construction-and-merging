Abundance of detrital zircons yielding Jurassic-Cretaceous ages with εHf(t) values mainly between −2 and +10, occurrence of chert, Cr-spinel, and pyroxene grains, together with southward paleocurrent directions indicate that the Duba Formation was sourced from the southern Qiangtang terrane and Bangong-Nujiang suture zone to the northThe Duoni Formation in the south was deposited in shelfal to fan-delta and fluvial environments

Abundant volcanic clasts, detrital zircons yielding Cretaceous ages with mainly negative εHf(t) values, and northward paleocurrents indicate an active volcanic source located in the central Lhasa terrane to the south, with minor input from the northern Lhasa terraneOnly the northern part of the Baingoin basin was directly controlled by the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision and may thus be considered a peripheral foreland basin, whereas the southern part was mainly influenced by tectonic processes related to the northward subduction of Neotethyan lithosphere, and may thus be comparable to a retroarc foreland basin

During the Cretaceous, the Lhasa block was influenced by both ongoing Lhasa-Qiangtang collision in the north and northward subduction of Neotethyan lithosphere in the south (England and Searle, 1986; Pan et al., 2006; Kapp et al., 2007; Leier et al., 2007b; Zhu et al., 2016)This complex paleotectonic scenario would imply the development of a peripheral foreland basin in the northern part of the Lhasa block

When was the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone closed, uplifted, and exhumed? During the Early Cretaceous (Kapp et al., 2005), before the Early Eocene (Wang et al., 2008), or after the India-Asia collision onset (Rowley and Currie, 2006)? Is there any direct sedimentary evidence in the Lhasa block that may help constraining the controversial timing of initial Lhasa-Qiangtang collision, ranging widely from as early as Middle Jurassic to as late as Late Cretaceous (Pan et al., 1983; Leier et al., 2007b; Baxter et al., 2009; Fan et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016; Bian et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017b; Ma et al., 2017)?The aim of this article is to investigate the Early Cretaceous sedimentary record of the northern Lhasa terrane in order to provide an answer to these questions and clarify the paleogeographic and paleogeodynamic evolution of the Lhasa block and Lhasa-Qiangtang

Because detritus from the Lhasa block have reached the mélange in trench of BNSZ since early Jurassic (Lai et al., 2017), these pre-Mesozoic detrital zircons, which have similar age spectra as those in the central Lhasa terrane, might be also recycled from the BNSZ.Combined petrographic, geochemical and geochronological evidence suggests that the Duba Formation was fed partly from the BNSZ and southern Qiangtang terrane in the north, where suprasubduction-zone ophiolites, a Jurassic magmatic arc, and preCretaceous strata were exposed to erosion, and partly from Lower Cretaceous magmatic rocks of the northern Lhasa terrane itself.

Most zircons yielded Early Cretaceous ages and negative εHf(t) values, which matches very well the age populations ranging between 143 and 107 Ma with negative εHf(t) values characterizing Zenong volcanic rocks of the central Lhasa terrane (Chu et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2009a; Zhu et al., 2011b)Furthermore, detrital zircons in the 950–1200 Ma age range characterize Upper Paleozoic strata of the central Lhasa terrane (Leier et al., 2007b; Leier et al., 2007c; Gehrels et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011a; G

Detrital zircons in the Duoni Formation compare poorly also with zircons with extremely positive εHf (t) values in the Gangdese magmatic arc and Xigaze forearc basin of the southern Lhasa terrane (Chu et al., 2006; Ji et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2011b; An et al., 2014), whereas some Cretaceous zircons with mildly positive (b8.0) εHf(t) values resemble those of magmatic zircons from the northern Lhasa terrane (Zhu et al., 2011b; Hou et al., 2015)Lower Cretaceous Zenong volcanics and Upper Paleozoic strata of the central Lhasa terrane were thus the predominant source of detritus for the Duoni Formation, possibly with minor contributions from the northern Lhasa terrane.

During the latest Early Cretaceous (Aptian-Albian), the articulated paleogeography of the Lhasa block included a residual seaway in the north, separated by central Lhasa highlands from a shallow seaway in the middle, separated in turn by the Gangdese arc from the Neotethys ocean to the south (Fig11).

sea in the southern Qiangtang basin should have retreated before the Aptian (Ma et al., 2018), because by 118 Ma continental redbeds sourced from Qiangtang highlands were deposited in the northern Nima basin ~300 km west of our studied area (DeCelles et al., 2007; Kapp et al., 2007).In the Aptian to early Albian, the Duoni and Duba formations are exposed in the southern and northern region Baingoin Basin (Fig

These zircon ages demonstrate that Early Cretaceous clastic rocks began accumulating before ~122 Ma; continued to accumulate until ~110–109 MaThe large benthic foraminifera and rudist of the Langshan limestone yielded an Aptian-Cenomanian age (Leier et al., 2007b; Scott et al., 2010; Rao et al., 2015; BouDagher-Fadel et al., 2017), thus, implying that these three formations were diachronous phenomenons in the Baingoin Basin during the Aptian to early Albian

Due to the global sea-level rising (Sun et al., 2017) or subsidence (Leier et al., 2007b) during Albian to Cenmanian, the Duba and Duoni formations were replaced by the Langshan marine carbonate environments on the northern Lhasa terrane.Provenance of the Duoni Formation from the central Lhasa terrane implies that central Lhasa was being uplifted as well, which is supported by the lack of Early Cretaceous strata (Pan et al., 2004) and by deposition around 111 Ma of the alluvial-fan Damxung Conglomerate southeast of Nam Co (Wang et al., 2017b) (Fig

Farther south in the Linzhou basin, b200-m-thick Orbitolinid-bearing limestones (Penbo Member of the Takena Formation) with terrestrial debris were being deposited in a shallow seaway separating the uplifted central Lhasa terrane from the Gandese arc, and replaced by northwardprograding fluvio-deltaic deposits not earlier than the late Albian (Leier et al., 2007a)The simultaneous limestones were also deposited in the west of the central Lhasa terrane (G

During the Aptian-Albian, instead, radiolarian cherts and deep-sea turbidites were being deposited in the underfilled Xigaze forearc basin floored by the Yarlung-Zangbo ophiolites (An et al., 2014; Orme and Laskowski, 2016; Wang et al., 2017a), implying that the southernmost Lhasa terrane lay at abyssal depths at the northern edge of the vast Neotethyan oceanic realm (Fig11).

Tectonic setting of Early Cretaceous sedimentary basins in northern LhasaThe early tectonic evolution of the Lhasa block during the Cretaceous, the origin of sedimentary basins, and the subduction polarity of Bangong oceanic lithosphere remain controversial (Leeder et al., 1988; Murphy et al., 1997; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Kapp et al., 2003a; Kapp

It has been proposed that, following closure of the Bangong Ocean in the north, a broad Cretaceous peripheral foreland basin formed in the northern part of the Lhasa block under the weight of the overthrusting Qiangtang terrane and Shiquanhe-Gaize-Amdo thrust system (Leeder et al., 1988; Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al., 2003a; Kapp et al., 2005; DeCelles et al., 2007)Considering instead the Gangdese arc in the south, the northern Lhasa terrane was proposed to have hosted a back-arc extensional (Zhang et al., 2004) or retroarc foreland basin (Zhang et al., 2011)

The geochemistry of widespread Cretaceous magmatic rocks in the northern Lhasa terrane suggest an orogenic rather than extensional setting (Zhu et al., 2009a; Zhu et al., 2011b; Chen et al., 2014; Hao et al., 2016), as independently indicated by major compressional tectonic structures bordering the Baingoin basin, including the Geren Co-Jiali thrust, Baingoin thrust, and the Shiquanhe-GaizeAmdo thrust (Yin and Harrison, 2000; Ding and Lai, 2003; Kapp et al., 2007; Volkmer et al., 2014).Our new stratigraphic observations indicate that the origin of the Baingoin basin is more complex than previously thought

Though the northern side of the basin may be considered a peripheral foreland basin, whereas the southern part is more comparable to a retroarc foreland basin, the peculiar features of the Aptian-Albian Baingoin basin thus do not fit well with any textbook modelThis special basin architecture was plausibly controlled by the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision in the northern part but mainly influenced by tectonic processes related to the northward subduction of Neotethyan lithosphere in the
