The Upper Jurassic Ula sandstone, Norwegian North Sea, a subarkose with 15 to 25 percent feldspar, displays stylolites with prominent low-porosity haloes up to 10 cm wideDetailed mineralogical and chemical profiles across several stylolites and haloes are used to investigate the role of feldspar in mineral reactions at stylolites and to constrain the transport of chemical components.

In the Middle Jurassic Brent sandstones of the North Sea, for example, stylolites first appear at a depth of approximately 3000 meters and a temperature of approximately 100uCThe volume of quartz cement begins to increase dramatically at that depth, such that at a depth only 400 meters deeper, the volume has effectively increased 3 to 4 fold, from 1–2 percent to 1–12 percent (Harris 1992 and references therein)

Quartz cement abundance is controlled by stylolite frequency only at a scale of tens of meters, for example in Upper Jurassic sandstones at the East Brae field, North Sea (Grau 2000).Because aluminum is relatively immobile, dissolution of K-feldspar at the edge of a stylolite produces a halo of illite in the sandstone adjacent to the stylolite
