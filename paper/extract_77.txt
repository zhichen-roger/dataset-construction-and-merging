Gas venting triggered by overpressure in contact aureoles within shale has been proposed to have caused global climate changes in the end-Permian, Early Jurassic (Toarcian), and at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary (Svensen et al., 2004, 2007, 2009).The aim of this study is to understand the formation of sandstone intrusions in dolerite sills

The sediments were deposited from the late Carboniferous to the Middle Jurassic, in an environment ranging from dominantly marine (the Dwyka and Ecca Groups) to fl uvial (theBeaufort Group and parts of the Stormberg Group) and eolian (upper part of the Stormberg Group) (Catuneanu et al., 1998; Veevers et al., 1994)
