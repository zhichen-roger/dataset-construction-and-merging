The high middle Eocene cooling rates from samples collected near the incipient Ruby Mountains–East Humboldt Range–Wood Hills–Pequop Mountains metamorphic core complex may reflect cooling of partially molten crust along a high geothermal gradient (Whitney et al., 2013)If these shortlag-time grains were sourced from the Ruby Mountains–East Humboldt Range–Wood Hills– Pequop Mountains metamorphic core complex, it would imply that the core complex was characterized by episodes of fast cooling initiating in the middle Eocene, rather than monotonous and protracted cooling (i.e., Rey et al., 2009b).

Basin-proximal magmatism began in the Tuscarora volcanic field at 40.2 Ma (Henry, 2008), and Eocene dikes and plutons intruded this area from 41 to 39 Ma (Henry and Boden, 1997, 1998; Henry et al., 1999; Ressel and Henry, 2006)The thermal effects of slab removal may induce localized extension, including initial core complex extension, directly prior to voluminous phases of volcanism associated with the rollback-driven influx of asthenosphere (Lister and Davis, 1989; Smith et al., 2014)

Identification of rapid middle Eocene cooling rates during a previously unconstrained phase of deformation in the Cordilleran hinterland reveals a pivotal transition from slow to rapid exhumation, accommodated by an initial pulse of extensional deformationRecent paleoaltimetry shows that this region remained at high elevations of 2.7–3.1 km from 41 to 28 Ma (Cassel et al., 2014, 2018) and indicates that this extension did not result in widespread surface lowering
