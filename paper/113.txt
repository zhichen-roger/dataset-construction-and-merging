Abstract: Detrital zircons from pre-orogenic Upper Ordovician to Devonian low-grade metasedimentary rocks have been dated by laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA–ICP-MS) to: (1) constrain the variations of zircon age populations within the autochthonous sequences of NW Iberia; (2) compare U–Pb detrital zircon ages with previous data; (3) test the hypothesis of the Armorica microplate as a peri-Gondwanan terrane separated from GondwanaThe similarity in the ages of detrital zircons found in the Palaeozoic samples studied here to those published for the Upper Proterozoic, Lower Cambrian and Lower Ordovician sediments of NW Iberia argues against the separation of Armorica, and points to a common source area for all of the Palaeozoic detrital formations of NW Iberia, the West African craton and the surrounding Pan-African belts
The similarity in the ages of detrital zircons found in the Palaeozoic samples studied here to those published for the Upper Proterozoic, Lower Cambrian and Lower Ordovician sediments of NW Iberia argues against the separation of Armorica, and points to a common source area for all of the Palaeozoic detrital formations of NW Iberia, the West African craton and the surrounding Pan-African beltsLA–ICP-MS U–Pb dating of zircons from a synorogenic flysch preserved in klippen in the core of a syncline establishes a maximum depositional age for this deposit as Early Namurian
The existence of Armorica as a separate microplate was proposed by Van der Voo (1982, 1988) to account for the similar apparent polar wander paths for the Armorican Massif and Gondwana until the Cambrian, but a difference in latitude of 30–408 during the Devonian (Van der Voo 1979, 1982, 1988; Perroud et al1984)
1984; Cocks, 2000) the Bohemian Massif and, according to these workers, it would have drifted away from Gondwana during the Ordovician, colliding with Laurentia in the Mid-Devonian, before the large continental masses did so to form Pangaea.The palaeomagnetic data on which this hypothesis relies were questioned by Kent et al
(1987), who reported a much higher latitude for Gondwana during the DevonianAlthough new data were used to support the existence of an Armorica microplate (Tait et al
Recent reconstructions by Scotese & McKerrow (1990) and Scotese (2002) place Gondwana close to Laurentia and Baltica by the Early Devonian (Fig1a).
during the Silurian and DevonianFurthermore, the suture between the hypothetical Armorica plate and Gondwana has not been found, putting in doubt the existence of a Proto-Tethys Ocean (Fig
This approach has been applied by Ferna´ndezSua´rez and coworkers in the Ibero-Armorican arc, to constrain the palaeoposition of Iberia and Brittany in the Neoproterozoic; those workers found that different zones within those Variscan realms occupied different positions at that time (Ferna´ndezSua´rez et al2000b, 2002c; Gutie´rrez-Alonso et al
Early Palaeozoic sediments and volcanic rocks have also been investigated in NW Iberia; namely, the Lower Cambrian and Lower Ordovician quartzites, and the volcaniclastic part of the Ollo de Sapo Formation (Ferna´ndez-Sua´rez et al1999, 2000b, 2002b)
These data have helped to constrain the time of amalgamation of the Neoproterozoic terranes to Gondwana, and the source areas of the lower part of the Palaeozoic sedimentary pile, and have confirmed the Early Ordovician age of the OlloThis study focuses on the use of U–Pb ages of detrital zircons to test and constrain the existing palaeotectonic models for the Variscan belt
(1999, 2000b, 2002b) have shown that the zircon age populations of Lower Cambrian and Lower Ordovician sedimentary rocks in Iberia are similar to those of Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks, which suggest the same source area, the West African craton and the surrounding Pan-African belts (Ferna´ndez-Sua´rez et al2002c)
If the drift of Armorica took place either later in the Ordovician or during the Silurian, the source area could no longer have been the West African craton and surrounding areas, and different age clustering should be expected for detrital zircon agesExtending the investigation of zircon age populations to Upper Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian (pre-orogenic) metasedimentary rocks may shed new light on whether or not of Armorica existed as a microplate at any time in the early to midPalaeozoic.
Extending the investigation of zircon age populations to Upper Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian (pre-orogenic) metasedimentary rocks may shed new light on whether or not of Armorica existed as a microplate at any time in the early to midPalaeozoic.Continental collision of Laurentia and Baltica with Gondwana started in NW Iberia probably during the Late Devonian (Dallmeyer et al
Continental collision of Laurentia and Baltica with Gondwana started in NW Iberia probably during the Late Devonian (Dallmeyer et al1997; Mart´ınez Catala´n et al
Carboniferous sedimentation was essentially synorogenic and the source areas changed drastically from the emerged areas of the foreland to the relief created in the hinterland by the continuing orogenic shortening (Marcos & Pulgar 1982; Pe´rez-Estau´n et al1988; Rodr´ıguez Ferna´ndez 1993)
They are essentially metasedimentary, and consist of thick and monotonous Upper Proterozoic siliciclastic rocks (cut by a few intrusions), and of Palaeozoic clastic rocks, carbonates, and volcanic and intrusive rocksIt is generally agreed that the autochthonous sedimentary sequences were deposited in the northern margin of Gondwana.
During the Late Proterozoic, this area was an active continental margin (Murphy & Nance 1991; Ochsner 1993) involved in the Cadomian–Avalonian–Pan-African orogenyCadomian arc
construction activity was followed by continental rifting in Cambro-Ordovician times, which resulted in the drift of the Avalon microcontinent and other peri-Gondwanan terranes and the opening of the Rheic oceanic domain (Fortey & Cocks 1988; Soper 1988)Some palaeomagnetic data suggest that Iberia, together with the French Armorican Massif, also drifted away from Gondwana during the Ordovician and collided with Laurentia in the Early or Mid-Devonian, prior to the Laurentia– Gondwana collision
Some palaeomagnetic data suggest that Iberia, together with the French Armorican Massif, also drifted away from Gondwana during the Ordovician and collided with Laurentia in the Early or Mid-Devonian, prior to the Laurentia– Gondwana collisionNevertheless, stratigraphic and palaeogeographical data suggest a continuity between Iberia and Gondwana throughout the Palaeozoic and deposition of the autochthonous sequences on the Gondwanan continental margin (Paris & Robardet 1990; Ribeiro et al
This margin seems to have been passive from the Cambrian to the Early Devonian, as suggested by the shallowwater platform character of most stratigraphic units, and also by the continuity in the sedimentation.As regards geochronological constraints, the oldest ages obtained from upper intercepts and inherited zircons from Iberian orthogneisses of the autochthon range between 2.7 and 1.8 Ga (Lancelot et al
1998; Valverde Vaquero & Dunning, 2000), and record the Cadomian orogeny and the Cambro-Ordovician continental riftingU–Pb dating of detrital zircons from Upper Proterozoic sedimentary rocks in NW Iberia (Ferna´ndez-Sua´rez et al
U–Pb dating of detrital zircons from Upper Proterozoic sedimentary rocks in NW Iberia (Ferna´ndez-Sua´rez et al2000b) yielded four main age clusters: Archaean (2.8–2.5 Ga), Palaeoproterozoic (2– 1.8 Ga), Mesoproterozoic (1.2–0.9 Ga) and Neoproterozoic (800–640 Ma)
2000b) yielded four main age clusters: Archaean (2.8–2.5 Ga), Palaeoproterozoic (2– 1.8 Ga), Mesoproterozoic (1.2–0.9 Ga) and Neoproterozoic (800–640 Ma)U–Pb dating of detrital zircons from Lower Palaeozoic sequences gave roughly the same populations, plus a younger Neoproterozoic (620–550 Ma) population (Ferna´ndezSua´rez et al
U–Pb dating of detrital zircons from Lower Palaeozoic sequences gave roughly the same populations, plus a younger Neoproterozoic (620–550 Ma) population (Ferna´ndezSua´rez et al1999, 2000b, 2002b).
The units were stacked in Early and Mid-Devonian time, during the first stages of the Variscan orogeny, and subsequently thrust over the autochthonous sequences during the Late Devonian–Carboniferous (Mart´ınez Catala´n et al1996; Dallmeyer et al
They record the major events in the African section of northern Gondwana, where no Mesoproterozoic events have been identified, and provide a maximum depositional age for this uppermost sedimentary unit at c480 Ma
This Early Devonian metamorphic event was followed by a subsequent retrograde amphibolite-facies metamorphism at 390–380 Ma (Dallmeyer et al1991, 1997; Valverde Vaquero & Ferna´ndez 1996).
This magmatism reflects the Ordovician rifting (Ribeiro & Floor 1987; Pin et al1992), and is coeval with that found in the autochthon, suggesting that the basal units formed part of the northern Gondwana platform
1987) represents a relatively distal part of the Gondwanan continental margin, and consists of Ordovician to Devonian sedimentary sequences similar to those of the autochthon, and younger synorogenic flysch deposits (Pereira et al1999; Gonza´lez Clavijo & Mart´ınez Catala´n, 2002)
In Terena, their age is Early Carboniferous (Schermerhorn 1971) and includes Tournaisian–Vise´an fauna (Giese et al1994), although Early Devonian fauna and flora have been reported in Portugal (Pereira et al
1994), although Early Devonian fauna and flora have been reported in Portugal (Pereira et al1998; Pic¸arra et al
In Los Pedroches, their age ranges from Late Tournaisian to Early Namurian (Mart´ınez Poyatos 2002).To the east of the Braganc¸a complex (Fig
2), the synorogenic flysch deposits are called the San Vitero Formation in the Alcan˜ices synform, in Spain (Mart´ınez Garcı´a 1972, 1973) and Gimonde Formation in Portugal (Meireles 2000a, b), and have been dated as Late Devonian by plant debris (Teixeira & Pais 1973) and palynomorphs (Pereira et al1999)
They disconformably overlie the Silurian succession and are involved in the D2 imbricated thrust system separating the allochthonous complexes from the autochthon (Ribeiro & Ribeiro 1974; Antona &Mart´ınez Catala´n 1990; Gonza´lez Clavijo 1997; Meireles 2000a, b; Gonza´lez Clavijo & Mart´ınez Catala´n, 2002)
The sampling area was chosen based on the presence of a continuous stratigraphic sequence from the Lower Ordovician to the Lower Devonian, the low-grade Variscan metamorphic overprint, the existence of synorogenic deposits and the relative proximity to the allochthonous complexesThe Courel, Truchas and Sil synclines (Fig
The first is a D1 isoclinal recumbent fold delineated by the Armorican Quartzite, whose core is occupied by Silurian carbonaceous slates and Lower Devonian detrital sedimentary rocks and limestones (Drot & Matte 1967; Matte 1968)The Truchas syncline, to the SE, is a broad (.20 km) D1 synclinorium formed by many individual recumbent folds
It is also outlined by the Armorican Quartzite, and cored by Middle–Upper Ordovician and Silurian pre-orogenic depositsThe Courel and Truchas synclines are separated from each other by a D1 anticline, which is recumbent in the west (Piornal anticline) and becomes steep to the east (Teleno anticline)
The Sil syncline occurs in the NW continuation of the Truchas syncline, but this is a narrower (6 km) D3 structure at whose core a synorogenic Carboniferous flysch, the San Clodio Formation, occursFigure 4 illustrates key stratigraphic columns, showing correlations among the synclines.
The succession starts with the Ollo de Sapo Formation, a Lower Ordovician thick volcanic and volcaniclastic sequence (Parga Pondal et al1964), and is followed by an alternation of pelites, sandstones and quartzites known as the Montes Slates (Riemer 1963), culminating in the Armorican Quartzite
1988), known as the Luarca Slates and, in the Truchas syncline, by the Casaio, Rozada´is and Losadilla Formations (Barros Lorenzo 1989), of Late Ordovician age (Caradoc–Ashgill; Pe´rez-Estau´n et al1990; Sarmiento et al
The Silurian succession begins locally with a quartzite, and mostly consists of grey and black carbonaceous slates and carbonaceous cherts (lydites)It rest comformably on the Ordovician sequence in the eastern part of the Truchas syncline and slightly unconformably elsewhere (Gutie´rrez Marco et al
It rest comformably on the Ordovician sequence in the eastern part of the Truchas syncline and slightly unconformably elsewhere (Gutie´rrez Marco et al1988)
In the Courel and Pen˜alba synclines, the Silurian sequence is conformably overlain by a Lower Devonian succession, the Seceda Formation, beginning with a thin quartzite layer followed by arenaceous slates containing brachiopods, grey crinoidal limestones and grey slates (Drot & Matte 1967).Synorogenic turbidites consisting of pelites and greywackes, the San Clodio Formation, crop out along a NW–SE synformal structure in the Sil syncline (Fig
Riemer (1966) decribed carbonaceous cherts at the base of the formation, reported thin coal veins, poorly preserved plant debris, and pebbles of quartzite, slate, gneiss and granite, and suggested a pre-Stephanian Carboniferous age, based on the fact that they were folded, but remarking that deformation is weaker here than in the underlying Ordovician slatesMatte (1968) discussed the deformation, and found no appreciable differences in metamorphism and cleavage development between the San Clodio Formation and older strata
According to him, the greywackes are not older than Late Devonian on the basis of the plant debris found.The San Clodio Formation rests usually on Middle to Upper Ordovician slates but often a few metres of Silurian carbonaceous slates and cherts occur between the turbidites and the underlying Ordovician units, and these rocks are commonly sheared and phyllonitized, indicating that they mark a detachment, which may be either a thrust fault or a gravity-driven structure (Barrera Morate et al

Furthermore, the lithologies of the San Clodio Formation are very similar to that of the San Vitero Formation in the Alcan˜ices synform, described in the previous section and which crops out on top of Silurian carbonaceous slates and cherts in thrust sheets subsequently folded and preserved in the core of a D3 syncline (Gonza´lez Clavijo & Mart´ınez Catala´n, 2002)It is worth noting that the presence of synorogenic sedimentary rocks in thrust sheets derived from more internal parts of the orogen seems to be a common feature in other parts of the Variscan Belt (Franke & Engel 1986).
Three pre-orogenic quartzites (PO-1, 2, 3) and two synorogenic samples (SO-1, 2), a greywacke and a conglomerate, were collected from the Upper Ordovician–Lower Devonian succession and in the San Clodio Formation, respectivelyThe sampling locations and stratigraphic and structural positions are shown in Figures 3 and 4.
According to its stratigraphic position, its age is Late Ordovician, most probably Ashgill (Sarmiento et al1999).
PO-2 is a quartzite at the base of the Silurian succession, also in the Truchas synclineIt is a medium-grained quartzite consisting of quartz, plagioclase, carbonate and subordinate tourmaline, zircon and opaque minerals
PO-3 is a quartzite at the base of the Devonian succession sampled to the north of Folgoso, in the Courel synclineIt is the most mature of the three pre-orogenic quartzites sampled, and consists of quartz and very Figure 3.
The three pre-orogenic quartzites have yielded the same five age populations: Archaean (2.7–2.5 Ga), Palaeoproterozoic (2.2– 1.8 Ga), Mesoproterozoic (1.1–1 Ga), Neoproterozoic (990– 555 Ma), and three zircons with Palaeozoic ages of 537, 516 and 499 Ma (Fig6).
The Precambrian age clusters are roughly the same as those found in the Upper Proterozoic, Lower Cambrian and Lower Ordovician sedimentary rocks of NW Iberia (Ferna´ndez-Sua´rezTable 2
The transition from the Cadomian orogeny, recorded by the Neoproterozoic population, to the CambroOrdovician rifting, is mainly marked by the scarce 535–500 Ma population, which had not been previously detected in the Lower Cambrian arkoses, the Ollo de Sapo Formation (Ferna´ndezSua´rez et al2000b) or the Armorican Quartzite (Ferna´ndezSua´rez et al
The greywacke and the conglomerate from the San Clodio Formation have both yielded four zircon age populations: Archaean (2.9–2.5 Ga), Palaeoproterozoic (2.3–1.8 Ga), Neoproterozoic–Ordovician (660–470 Ma), and latest Silurian–Carboniferous (417–324 Ma)The main differences from the preorogenic samples are: (1) the absence of a Mesoproterozoic population; (2) the absence of an older Neoproterozoic population; (3) the continuity between the Neoproterozoic and Early Palaeozoic ages; (4) the younger Early Palaeozoic ages; (5) the presence of a Late Palaeozoic population recording Variscan events.
The main differences from the preorogenic samples are: (1) the absence of a Mesoproterozoic population; (2) the absence of an older Neoproterozoic population; (3) the continuity between the Neoproterozoic and Early Palaeozoic ages; (4) the younger Early Palaeozoic ages; (5) the presence of a Late Palaeozoic population recording Variscan events.In the conglomerate, which has a larger Late Palaeozoic population, the youngest zircon dated is concordant with a 324  7 Ma age
All massifs were covered by a fairly continuous Palaeozoic detrital succession, ranging in age from the Cambrian or Early Ordovician to the Devonian, whereas large outcrops of basement older than the Neoproterozoic, which could have acted as supply areas, are absent.A salient feature of the data set is that the Precambrian age clusters of our samples are identical to those reported for the Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks underlying these Palaeozoic sequences
A salient feature of the data set is that the Precambrian age clusters of our samples are identical to those reported for the Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks underlying these Palaeozoic sequencesThis implies either the same source area, or a recycling of previous deposits
Some recycling was probably related to normal faulting and erosion of the elevated blocks, as has been proposed for the Upper Ordovician sequence in the study area (Marcos 1973; Pe´rez-Estau´n & Marcos 1981; Pe´rezEstau´n et al1990; Mart´ınez Catala´n et al
The marked scarcity of recycled Cambro-Ordovician zircons (representing granitoids and coeval volcanic rocks) and, in particular, the absence of 490–460 Ma ages that could represent the erosion of the Ollo de Sapo volcanic rocks argues against the reworking of older depositsThe fact that these rocks were not supplying detritus to the sedimentary basin is consistent with the geological observation that they always appear covered by the younger deposits, with little or no discontinuity until the Devonian.
The fact that these rocks were not supplying detritus to the sedimentary basin is consistent with the geological observation that they always appear covered by the younger deposits, with little or no discontinuity until the Devonian.Our data suggest a common source area for the Neoproterozoic and the pre-orogenic Palaeozoic sediments, deposited before the start of the Variscan orogeny
Our data suggest a common source area for the Neoproterozoic and the pre-orogenic Palaeozoic sediments, deposited before the start of the Variscan orogenyThis area would have included the West African craton and the surrounding PanAfrican belts, with the addition of a terrane with Mesoproterozoic rocks or its erosion products, possibly an Amazonian or Oaxacan terrane, as suggested by Ferna´ndez-Sua´rez et al

The absence of a Mesoproterozoic population in the synorogenic samples indicates that the underlying Palaeozoic and Upper Proterozoic sediments did not supply significant detritus to the San Clodio FormationFurthermore, although the Ordovician population matches that found in the Ollo de Sapo Formation (490–460 Ma; Ferna´ndez-Sua´rez et al
Furthermore, although the Ordovician population matches that found in the Ollo de Sapo Formation (490–460 Ma; Ferna´ndez-Sua´rez et al2000b), the lack of 1.1– 0.9 Ga zircons also indicates that this formation did not feed the synorogenic deposits.
The only known potential source whose age spectrum fits the zircon ages of the San Clodio Formation is the allochthonous complexes, where the uppermost low-grade metasedimentary succession of the Ordenes Complex includes 2.5–2.4, 2.1– 1.9 Ga and 610–480 Ma age clusters and lacks the Mesoproterozoic and the Early Neoproterozoic populations (Ferna´ndezSua´rez et al2003)
1999), whereas younger Ordovician ages fit those of granitic and peralkaline orthogneisses of the basal units (Van Calsteren et al1979; Garc´ıa Garzo´n et al
Late Silurian and Devonian ages between 417 and 360 Ma may reflect the exhumation of medium- to high-grade rocks of many of the allochthonous units (Van Calsteren et al1979; Dallmeyer et al
Finally, Early to Mid-Carboniferous zircons (355–324 Ma) may be derived from rocks with high-temperature metamorphism and migmatization of comparable age found in some basal units (346 Ma; Abati & Dunning, 2002) and possibly also fromThe relationship between synorogenic sedimentation and thrusting of the allochthonous complexes was described by Gonza´lez Clavijo & Mart´ınez Catala´n (2002), and is sketched in Figure 7
The complexes were stacked during the Devonian in an accretionary wedge to the west or NW of the Rheic oceanic basin (Mart´ınez Catala´n et al1997)
If the Gimonde Formation has a Late Devonian age (Pereira et al1999), the Late Vise´an–Early Namurian age of the San Clodio Formation would confirm the progradation of the deformation to the east, with the youngest deposits cropping out far from the allochthonous complexes and forming part of the lowermost imbricates.
Five zircon age populations have been found in Upper Ordovician to Lower Devonian quartzites of the autochthonous pre-orogenic sequences of NW Iberian Massif: Archaean (2.8–2.5 Ga), Palaeoproterozoic (2.3–1.8 Ga), Mesoproterozoic (1.1–1 Ga), Neoproterozoic (990–555 Ma) and Palaeozoic (535–500 Ma)All but the last age cluster had been previously reported in Neoproterozoic, Lower Cambrian and Lower Ordovician sedimentary rocks in the same area of NW Spain
All but the last age cluster had been previously reported in Neoproterozoic, Lower Cambrian and Lower Ordovician sedimentary rocks in the same area of NW Spain(Ferna´ndez-Sua´rez et al
2000b, 2002b), and the similarity of detrital zircon ages throughout the pre-orogenic sequences suggests a common source area from Neoproterozoic to Early Devonian timeOur data do not favour the existence of Armorica as a separate microplate
Instead, they indicate that the Iberian Massif remained attached to the northern margin of Gondwana until the Early Devonian and support the palaeomagnetic data yielding a relatively low palaeolatitude for Gondwana in the Devonian (Fig1a).
Synorogenic greywackes and conglomerates have yielded four zircon age populations: Archaean (2.9–2.5 Ga), Palaeoproterozoic (2.3–1.8 Ga), Neoproterozoic–Ordovician (660–470 Ma) and latest Silurian–Carboniferous (417–324 Ma)The youngest concordant zircon (324 Ma) establishes a maximum limit for the depositional age of the San Clodio Formation but, taking into account its synorogenic character, this age probably reflects very closely the time of sedimentation
