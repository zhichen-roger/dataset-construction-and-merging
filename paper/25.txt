The Himalayan–Tibetan Plateau is an amalgamation of individual terranes that detached from northern Gondwana and accreted onto southern Asia in a series of collision during Paleozoic and Cenozoic (Allègre et al., 1984; Dewey et al., 1988; Gehrels et al., 2011; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Zhu et al., 2013)The Lhasa terrane, bounded by the Bangong–Nujiang suture zone in the north and the Indus–Yarlung Tsangpo suture zone in the south (Fig
1a), is generally considered to have rifted from the northern Gondwanaland in the Triassic or the Middle to Late Jurassic, and drifted northward across the Tethyan ocean before it collided with the Qiangtang terrane in Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous (Dewey et al., 1988; Gehrels et al., 2011; Yin and Harrison,2000)
Recent discoveries of the Permian–Triassic garnet glaucophane blueschist in Pana (Liu et al., 2009), the Permian MORB-type eclogite belt in Sumdo (Chen et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2012; Li et al., 2009b; Yang et al., 2009; Zeng et al., 2009) and spatially associated Carboniferous ophiolite (Chen et al., 2009) indicate the presence of a Paleo-Tethys ocean between the South and North Lhasa terranes, although Metcalfe (2013) argue that the eclogite was a part of arc constructed on the Lhasa terraneThis Paleo-Tethys ocean has been termed the Sumdo Paleo-Tethys or North Gangdese Ocean (Xu et al., 2013b; Yang et al., 2009)
Hence, Late Paleozoic magmatism in the Lhasa terrane can provide an important constraint on its tectonic evolutionAlthough Late Devonian-Permian magmatic rocks in the Lhasa terrane have been reported (Dong et al., 2010b, 2014; Geng et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2009; Ji et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2009, 2010), these studies on the Late Paleozoic magmatic rocks are too limited to fully explore their geodynamic setting.
Although Late Devonian-Permian magmatic rocks in the Lhasa terrane have been reported (Dong et al., 2010b, 2014; Geng et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2009; Ji et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2009, 2010), these studies on the Late Paleozoic magmatic rocks are too limited to fully explore their geodynamic setting.Zircon is a robust mineral such that its trace-element and isotopic (e.g., U-Pb, Hf, and O isotopes) compositions can survive the geologic processes of erosion, transportation, diagenesis, metamorphism, and even crustal melting, and is commonly preserved in sedimentary rocks (Fedo et al., 2003)
Previous studies have shown that the metasedimentary rocks from the Nyingchi Complex in the eastern South Lhasa terrane contain abundant Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous detrital zircons (Dong et al., 2010a; Guo et al., 2012; Zhang and Wu, 2012)Analysis of such detrital zircons provides a means by which tectono-thermal events that are otherwise absent from the lithological record may be reconstructed, and this information can be used to unravel details of the Late Paleozoic tectonic and geodynamic evolution of the Lhasa terrane in which their magmatic host rocks formed
Analysis of such detrital zircons provides a means by which tectono-thermal events that are otherwise absent from the lithological record may be reconstructed, and this information can be used to unravel details of the Late Paleozoic tectonic and geodynamic evolution of the Lhasa terrane in which their magmatic host rocks formedThis study integrates U-Pb geochronology, trace-element analyses, and Hf isotope analyses of detrital zircons and discusses the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous evolution of the Lhasa terrane.
This study integrates U-Pb geochronology, trace-element analyses, and Hf isotope analyses of detrital zircons and discusses the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous evolution of the Lhasa terrane.The Lhasa terrane can be divided into the South and North Lhasa terranes, separated by the Carboniferous–Permian North Gangdese suture zone (Fig
The Lhasa terrane can be divided into the South and North Lhasa terranes, separated by the Carboniferous–Permian North Gangdese suture zone (Fig1a), as represented by the Permian-Triassic garnet glaucophane blueschist in Pana (Liu et al., 2009), the Permian eclogite belt in Sumdo (Chen et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2012; Li et al., 2009b; Yang et al., 2009; Zeng et al., 2009) and spatially associated Carboniferous ultramafic massifs (Chen et al., 2009)

In addition, a Triassic (225–200 Ma) medium pressure (0.6–0.9 GPa) amphibolite-facies metamorphic belt, which is typical of Barrovian-type metamorphism, was recognized from Yangbajing in the west to Basongco in the east between the South and North Lhasa terranes (Fig1a) (Dong et al., 2011a; Lin et al., 2013b; Weller et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014)
The North Lhasa terrane is underlain by ancient basement rocks that experienced multiple episodes of metamorphic overprinting and magmatism from the Neoproterozoic to Cenozoic times (Dong et al., 2011a, 2011b; Hu et al., 2005; Kapp et al., 2005; Xie et al., 2014; Xu et al., 1985; Zhang et al., 2012b, 2014)This basement is covered by the widespread Carboniferous-Permian and Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary rocks, and minor Ordovician-Devonian and Triassic limestones (Zhu et al., 2012a, 2013)
This basement is covered by the widespread Carboniferous-Permian and Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary rocks, and minor Ordovician-Devonian and Triassic limestones (Zhu et al., 2012a, 2013)The CarboniferousPermian strata unconformably overlie the Devonian and Precambrian rocks
The CarboniferousPermian strata unconformably overlie the Devonian and Precambrian rocksThe Carboniferous sediments represent deep-marine transgressive deposits, indicating a marginal rifting setting (Geng et al., 2007a, 2009)
The Carboniferous sediments represent deep-marine transgressive deposits, indicating a marginal rifting setting (Geng et al., 2007a, 2009)The Carboniferous-Permian volcanic and intrusive rocks are scattered along the southern margin of the North Lhasa terrane from Coqen County in the west to Ranwu Town in the east (Fig
The Carboniferous-Permian volcanic and intrusive rocks are scattered along the southern margin of the North Lhasa terrane from Coqen County in the west to Ranwu Town in the east (Fig1a) (Geng et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2009; Wang et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2009, 2010)
The Carboniferous volcanic rocks include basalts, dacites, and rhyolites, forming a bimodal volcanic suite (Geng et al., 2007a)The basalts show geochemical characteristics of continental flood basalts and sourced from partial melting of enriched mantle, indicating that they formed in a rift setting (Geng et al., 2007a)
Some Carboniferous basalts display geochemical characteristics of island-arc volcanic rocks (Wang et al., 2008)The Permian basalts exhibit a calc-alkaline, high-alumina basalt affinity, with significant negative Nb-Ta-Ti anomalies, indicating that they probably formed in an active continental margin arc system (Fig
The Permian basalts exhibit a calc-alkaline, high-alumina basalt affinity, with significant negative Nb-Ta-Ti anomalies, indicating that they probably formed in an active continental margin arc system (Fig1a) (Geng et al., 2007b, 2009; Wang et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2009, 2010)
Abundant Triassic granites occur along the south margin of North Lhasa terrane from Coqen to Bome County (Li et al., 2009a, 2012; Zhang et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011b)These granites are peraluminous and have negative zircon εHf(t) values, indicating that they resulted from partial melting of ancient crustal materials in a syn- or post-collisional setting (Li et al., 2009a, 2012; Zhang et al., 2007)
The Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous magmatic rocks are widespread in the North Lhasa terrane, and may have resulted from the southward subduction of the Bangong-Nujiang Tethyan oceanic slab (Chen et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2011b, and references therein).The South Lhasa terrane is dominated by the Late Triassic-Cenozoic Gangdese batholith and Linzizong volcanic succession resulting from the northward subduction of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic crust beneath the Lhasa terrane (Chu et al., 2006; Coulon et al., 1986; Guo et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2013; Mo et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2014; Wen et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2011b)
The South Lhasa terrane is dominated by the Late Triassic-Cenozoic Gangdese batholith and Linzizong volcanic succession resulting from the northward subduction of the Neo-Tethyan oceanic crust beneath the Lhasa terrane (Chu et al., 2006; Coulon et al., 1986; Guo et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2014; Lee et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2013; Mo et al., 2008; Pan et al., 2014; Wen et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2011b)A few Cambrian and Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous magmatic rocks have been reported in the Jiacha and Langxian areas in the eastern South Lhasa terrane (Fig
A few Cambrian and Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous magmatic rocks have been reported in the Jiacha and Langxian areas in the eastern South Lhasa terrane (Fig1a) (Dong et al., 2010b, 2014; Ji et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2013)
The Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous (371–345 Ma) magmatic rocks include granitic gneisses (Dong et al., 2010b, 2014; Ji et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2013) and amphibolites which had experienced amphibolite-facies metamorphism at ~105 Ma (Dong et al., 2014)The protoliths of the amphibolites, showing within-plate basalt affinities, originated form partial melting of the enriched mantle (Dong et al., 2014)
The South Lhasa terrane consists of the high-grade metamorphic sequence (Nyingchi Complex), Carboniferous − Triassic strata and 165–22 Ma granitoids and mafic rocks (Booth et al., 2009; Burg et al., 1997; Dong et al., 2010a; Geng et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2011, 2013; Zhang et al., 2010a, 2013)The Nyingchi Complex is a tectonic mélange and mainly consists of schists, migmatite, orthogneisses, paragneisses and metasandstone, with minor quartzite, calc-silicate rocks, marble and granulite (Dong et al., 2010a; Guo et al., 2011, 2012, 2013; Lin et al., 2013a; Zhang et al., 2008, 2010b, 2013, 2015)
The Nyingchi Complex was previously considered to be the Precambrian basement of the Lhasa terrane (Geng et al., 2006)However, the recent studies show that the orthogneisses from the Nyingchi Complex have protolith crystallization ages ranging from Paleoproterozoic (~1782 Ma) to Cambrian (~496 Ma) (Dong et al.,
However, the recent studies show that the orthogneisses from the Nyingchi Complex have protolith crystallization ages ranging from Paleoproterozoic (~1782 Ma) to Cambrian (~496 Ma) (Dong et al.,2010a; Lin et al., 2013a), and the metasedimentary rocks from the Nyingchi Complex have maximum protolith depositional ages ranging from Paleozoic to Cenozoic (Dong et al., 2010a; Guo et al., 2012, 2013; Zhang and Wu, 2012; Zhang et al., 2008)
2010a; Lin et al., 2013a), and the metasedimentary rocks from the Nyingchi Complex have maximum protolith depositional ages ranging from Paleozoic to Cenozoic (Dong et al., 2010a; Guo et al., 2012, 2013; Zhang and Wu, 2012; Zhang et al., 2008)The Nyingchi Complex underwent upper amphibolite-facies, locally to granulite-facies metamorphism during the Late Mesozoic to Cenozoic (Booth et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013a; Zhang et al., 2010b).
The Nyingchi Complex underwent upper amphibolite-facies, locally to granulite-facies metamorphism during the Late Mesozoic to Cenozoic (Booth et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2013; Lin et al., 2013a; Zhang et al., 2010b).Zircon grains were separated from the metasedimentary samples using heavy liquid and magnetic separation techniques
The two-mica K-feldspar gneiss is intruded by the Middle Jurassic (~165 Ma) granitic gneiss (Guo et al., 2011)Sample T630 is a metasandstone mainly composed of quartz (96 percent), biotite (2 percent), and muscovite (2 percent) (Fig
For comparison, the available Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous magmatic rocks from the Qiangtang terrane (Jiang et al., 2015), South Lhasa terrane (Dong et al., 2014; Ji et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2013), Indus-Yarlung Tsangpo suture zone (Dai et al., 2011), and Longmuco-Shuanghu suture zone (Zhai et al., 2013) are also plottedCHUR = chondritic uniform reservoir; and DM = depleted mantle.
These weighted mean ages are identical within errors, suggesting that their protoliths probably were deposited during the Carboniferous (~330 Ma).Detrital zircons in the metasedimentary rocks show core-rim structures (Fig
4b, Table A1), which is compatible with the Eocene metamorphism and crustal anatexis in the Nyingchi Complex (Dong et al., 2010a; Guo et al., 2011, 2012; Zhang and Wu, 2012; Zhang et al., 2013).5.2
Considerable debate surrounds the Paleozoic-Early Mesozoic paleogeographic position of the Lhasa terrane in the Eastern GondwanaIt is generally considered that both the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes located on the northern margin of Indian plate (model I), with the Qiangtang terrane rifting during the Permian followed by the Lhasa terrane during the Late Triassic (Allègre et al., 1984; Burrett et al., 2014; Gehrels et al., 2011; Metcalfe, 2011; Yin and Harrison, 2000)
It is generally considered that both the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes located on the northern margin of Indian plate (model I), with the Qiangtang terrane rifting during the Permian followed by the Lhasa terrane during the Late Triassic (Allègre et al., 1984; Burrett et al., 2014; Gehrels et al., 2011; Metcalfe, 2011; Yin and Harrison, 2000)However, competing studies have proposed that the Lhasa terrane was adjacent to Northwest Australia in the Late Precambrian-Devonian and Late Permian-Triassic periods (model II) (Audley-Charles, 1983, 1984; Ferrari et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2011a, 2012b, 2013), and Zhu et al
However, competing studies have proposed that the Lhasa terrane was adjacent to Northwest Australia in the Late Precambrian-Devonian and Late Permian-Triassic periods (model II) (Audley-Charles, 1983, 1984; Ferrari et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2011a, 2012b, 2013), and Zhu et al(2010, 2013) proposed that the Lhasa terrane was an isolated microcontinent within the Paleo-Tethys ocean basin during the Carboniferous to Early Permian (model III)
(2010, 2013) proposed that the Lhasa terrane was an isolated microcontinent within the Paleo-Tethys ocean basin during the Carboniferous to Early Permian (model III)Detrital zircons from the metasedimentary rocks in the Nyingchi Complex define a distinctive age population of 390–330 Ma (Fig
7a) (Dong et al., 2010a; Guo et al., 2012; Zhang and Wu, 2012; this study), that provides an important provenance indicator thus shedding light on the Late Paleozoic paleogeographic position of the Lhasa terrane.According to the paleogeographic model I, the potential source for the Carboniferous sedimentary rocks in the Nyingchi Complex include the Indian plate and Qiangtang terrane
According to the paleogeographic model I, the potential source for the Carboniferous sedimentary rocks in the Nyingchi Complex include the Indian plate and Qiangtang terraneThe Carboniferous-Permian and Jurassic strata of Tethyan Himalayan sequence formed as a passive margin sequence along the northern margin of India (Brookfield, 1993; Yin, 2006), and were mainly shed from India and Antarctica plates (Gehrels et al., 2011, and references therein)
The Carboniferous-Permian and Jurassic strata of Tethyan Himalayan sequence formed as a passive margin sequence along the northern margin of India (Brookfield, 1993; Yin, 2006), and were mainly shed from India and Antarctica plates (Gehrels et al., 2011, and references therein)The absence of the 390–330 Ma detrital zircons in the Tethyan Himalayan sequence (Fig
7b) (Aikman et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010; Webb et al., 2013; Zhu et al., 2011a, and references therein) excludes the possibility that the Indian plate was the provenance of the Carboniferous sedimentary rocks from the Nyingchi ComplexAlthough Upper Triassic strata from the Tethyan Himalayan sequence contain 390–330 Ma detrital zircons (Fig
Although Upper Triassic strata from the Tethyan Himalayan sequence contain 390–330 Ma detrital zircons (Fig7b), the paleocurrent data and detrital zircon Hf isotopic composition indicate that they were derived from the Lhasa terrane (Li et al., 2010)
Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous (364–346 Ma) magmatic rocks have been recognized in the Qiangtang terrane (Jiang et al., 2015; Pullen et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2013)If the sediments were derived from the Qiangtang terrane, Carboniferous-Triassic strata from the Southern Qiangtang terrane should also contain 390–330 Ma zircons
If the sediments were derived from the Qiangtang terrane, Carboniferous-Triassic strata from the Southern Qiangtang terrane should also contain 390–330 Ma zirconsHowever, this is not the case, and the 390–330 Ma age population is absent (Fig
In the same way, although the Late Devonian-Carboniferous magmatic rocks were widespread in the Eastern Australia (e.g., Klootwijk, 2013; Murgulov et al., 2013), the absence of the 390–330 Ma detrital zircons in PermianTriassic strata from the West Australia (Fig7d) (Cawood and Nemchin, 2000; Lewis and Sircombe, 2013; Veevers et al., 2005) indicates that the Eastern Australia did not supply clastic materials to the Lhasa terrane during the Late Permian-Triassic periods on basis of the paleogeographic model II.

Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous magmatic rocks have been reported from both the South and North Lhasa terranes (Fig1a)
In addition, the Devonian-Carboniferous inherited zircons in the Gangdese batholith and associated volcanic rocks (Chu et al., 2011; Chung et al., 2009; Quidelleur et al., 1997; Wen et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2011b), and detrital zircons in the modern river sediment (Zhang et al., 2012a) indicate that magmatic rocks of Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous age were widespread in the South Lhasa terrane (Ji et al., 2012)The Carboniferous volcanic rocks in the North Lhasa terrane were distributed from Shiquanhe in the west to Bome in the east (Fig
The Carboniferous volcanic rocks in the North Lhasa terrane were distributed from Shiquanhe in the west to Bome in the east (Fig1a) (Geng et al., 2007a; Wang et al., 2008)
Moreover, the Triassic Mailonggang Formation sandstones from the North Lhasa terrane contain abundant 380–330 Ma detrital zircons (Fig7e) (Li et al., 2014)
Detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic compositions are consistent with derivation of these rocks from nearby Triassic magmatic rocks and basements in the Late PermianTriassic Sumdo-Cuoqin orogenic belt within the Lhasa terrane (Li et al., 2014)We therefore propose that the most likely provenance for the 390–330 Ma detrital zircons from the metasedimentary rocks in the Nyingchi Complex is the Lhasa terrane itself (South and North
This speculation is supported by some of the 390–330 Ma detrital zircons having Hf isotopic composition similar to those of the zircons from the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous magmatic rocks in the eastern South Lhasa terrane (Fig6) (Dong
The discrepancies of detrital zircon age spectra for Carboniferous-Triassic strata between the Lhasa terrane and other terranes (Tethyan Himalaya of northernIndia, West Australia, and Southern Qiangtang terrane) indicate that
these terranes were not tectonically linked during CarboniferousTriassicThis speculation is consistent with the suggestion that the Lhasa terrane was an isolated microcontinent (model III) within the Paleo-Tethys ocean during Late Paleozoic time (Zhu et al., 2010, 2013).
This speculation is consistent with the suggestion that the Lhasa terrane was an isolated microcontinent (model III) within the Paleo-Tethys ocean during Late Paleozoic time (Zhu et al., 2010, 2013).The older detrital zircon age populations of 490–800 Ma, 1000–1200 Ma, and 1500–1800 Ma from the metasedimentary rocks in the Nyingchi Complex probably sourced from the Early Paleozoic (Dong et al., 2010a; Zhu et al., 2012a), Neoproterozoic (Hu et al., 2005), Mesoproterozoic (Xu et al., 2013a), and Paleoproterozoic (Lin et al., 2013a) magmatic rocks in the Lhasa terrane
The older detrital zircon age populations of 490–800 Ma, 1000–1200 Ma, and 1500–1800 Ma from the metasedimentary rocks in the Nyingchi Complex probably sourced from the Early Paleozoic (Dong et al., 2010a; Zhu et al., 2012a), Neoproterozoic (Hu et al., 2005), Mesoproterozoic (Xu et al., 2013a), and Paleoproterozoic (Lin et al., 2013a) magmatic rocks in the Lhasa terraneIn addition, these older detrital zircons have similar age spectra to those of detrital zircons in Neoproterozoic-Early Paleozoic strata from the South and North Lhasa terranes (Fig
In addition, these older detrital zircons have similar age spectra to those of detrital zircons in Neoproterozoic-Early Paleozoic strata from the South and North Lhasa terranes (Fig7a and e)
Therefore, they also probably recycled from Neoproterozoic-Early Paleozoic sedimentary rocks (Gehrels et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011a; Our unpublished data).5.3
Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous magmatism in the Lhasa terraneAs discussed above, the 390–330 Ma detrital zircons in the Nyingchi Complex are inferred to have been derived from the Lhasa terrane, suggesting that the Lhasa terrane was characterized by Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous magmatism
As discussed above, the 390–330 Ma detrital zircons in the Nyingchi Complex are inferred to have been derived from the Lhasa terrane, suggesting that the Lhasa terrane was characterized by Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous magmatismAlthough the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous magmatic rocks have been reported in the Lhasa terrane (Dong et al., 2014; Geng et al., 2007a; Ji et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2008, 2013; Wu et al., 2013), their petrogenesis and tectonic-setting remain unclear
Although the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous magmatic rocks have been reported in the Lhasa terrane (Dong et al., 2014; Geng et al., 2007a; Ji et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2008, 2013; Wu et al., 2013), their petrogenesis and tectonic-setting remain unclearThe trace-element composition of magmatic zircon is sensitive to the composition of its magmatic host rock and crystallization environment (e.g., Belousova et al., 2002; Grimes et al., 2007; Hoskin and Ireland, 2000; Hoskin and Schaltegger, 2003; Nardi et al., 2013; Schulz et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2012)
Therefore, the trace-element composition of the 390–330 Ma detrital magmatic zircons in the Nyingchi Complex provides a means to unravel the tectonic setting of the Late DevonianEarly Carboniferous magmatism in the Lhasa terrane.The trace-element compositions of the 390–330 Ma detrital zircons indicate that they were derived from mafic rocks, granitoids and minor carbonatites (Belousova et al., 2002)

9), suggesting that their magmatic host rocks were produced within the volcanic arc and within-plate settings during Late Devonian-Early CarboniferousNo zircons plot into the MORB-type rock field (Fig
These results show that the volcanic-arc magmatism, rifting-related magmatism, and crustal anatexis coexisted in the Lhasa terrane during the Late Devonian-Early CarboniferousThis is consistent with previous studies of the Late Devonian-Carboniferous magmatic rocks (Dong et al., 2014; Geng et al., 2007a; Ji et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2013)
This is consistent with previous studies of the Late Devonian-Carboniferous magmatic rocks (Dong et al., 2014; Geng et al., 2007a; Ji et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2013)Wang et al
(2008) reported the Carboniferous arc volcanic rocks in the North Lhasa terrane, which resulted from southward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys oceanic crustGeng et al
(2007a) found that some Carboniferous basalts in the North Lhasa terrane have similar geochemical characteristics to those of continental flood basalts, and proposed that they formed in a rift settingThese basalts have markedly negative εNd(t) values (as low as −12), indicating that they were derived from partial melting of enriched mantle (Geng et al., 2007a)
The discoveries of the Permian Sumdo eclogite belt and of spatially associated Carboniferous ophiolite indicate that the Lhasa terrane can be divided into the South and North Lhasa terranes, separating by the Sumdo Paleo-Tethys ocean (Chen et al., 2008, 2009; Cheng et al., 2012; Li et al., 2009b; Yang et al., 2009; Zeng et al., 2009)When and how the Sumdo Paleo-Tethys ocean opened and how it evolved remain unclear
The coeval occurrences of the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous volcanic-arc magmatism, riftingrelated magmatism, and crustal anatexis in the Lhasa terrane indicate that these tectono-thermal events probably formed in an arc-back-arc systemThis speculation is supported by following studies: (1) Carboniferous sediments in the North Lhasa terrane unconformably overlie the Devonian and Precambrian rocks and represent deep-marine transgressive deposits, indicating a marginal rifting setting (Geng et al., 2007a, 2009); (2) Geng et al
This speculation is supported by following studies: (1) Carboniferous sediments in the North Lhasa terrane unconformably overlie the Devonian and Precambrian rocks and represent deep-marine transgressive deposits, indicating a marginal rifting setting (Geng et al., 2007a, 2009); (2) Geng et al(2007a) and Dong et al
(2014) considered that the Carboniferous bimodal magmatic associations in the North and South Lhasa terranes formed in the back-arc extensional setting; (3) Ji et al(2012) and Wu et al
(2013) proposed that the Early Carboniferous granitoids from Langxian and Jiacha areas in the South Lhasa terrane were derived from reworking of ancient basement in a back-arc extensional setting associated with outboard subduction; (4) The protoliths of the Sumdo eclogites exhibit geochemical characteristics of back-arc basin basalt (Cheng et al., 2012; Li et al., 2009b)Therefore, we considered that the Sumdo Paleo-Tethys ocean developed from this back-arc basin in Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous.
Therefore, we considered that the Sumdo Paleo-Tethys ocean developed from this back-arc basin in Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous.Cheng et al
However, the DevonianCarboniferous arc magmatism is absent in South Lhasa terraneThe North Lhasa terrane contains the Carboniferous arc magmatic rocks (Wang et al., 2008) and bimodal volcanic rocks (Geng et al., 2007a)
The North Lhasa terrane contains the Carboniferous arc magmatic rocks (Wang et al., 2008) and bimodal volcanic rocks (Geng et al., 2007a)Therefore, this arc-back-arc system probably was related to the southward subduction Paleo-Tethys oceanic crust (Fig
The roll-back of oceanic slab would have caused the upwelling of asthenosphere and back-arc rifting, which resulted in the Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous bimodal magmatism both in the South and North Lhasa terranes (Fig11b)
This back-arc basin subsequently evolved into a mature ocean (Sumdo Paleo-Tethys ocean) before the Early Permian (Fig11c), as indicated by the ~303 Ma MORB-type eclogite (Yang et al., 2009; Zeng et al., 2009)
The northward subduction of the Sumdo Paleo-Tethys oceanic crust resulted in the Permian arc magmatism in the North Lhasa terrane (Geng et al., 2007b, 2009; Wang et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2009, 2010) and the ultrahigh-pressure metamorphism of the oceanic slab (Fig11d) (Chen et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2012; Li et al., 2009b; Yang et al., 2009; Zeng et al., 2009)
The final closure of the Sumdo Paleo-Tethys ocean probably occurred during the Late Triassic (Fig11e)
The collision between South and North Lhasa terranes led to the Triassic high-grade metamorphism (Dong et al., 2011a; Lin et al., 2013b; Weller et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014) and widespread crustal anatexis (Li et al., 2009a, 2012; Zhang et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011b).Detrital zircons from the metasedimentary rocks in the Nyingchi Complex in the eastern South Lhasa terrane define four age populations of 330–364 Ma, 490–800 Ma, 1000–1200 Ma, and 1500–1800 Ma
The weighted mean ages of the youngest three detrital zircons indicate Carboniferous (~330 Ma) depositional age for their sedimentary protolithsThe protoliths of the metasedimentary rocks were derived from the Lhasa terrane itself (South and North Lhasa terranes)
The presence of abundant 330–364 Ma detrital zircons indicates that the Lhasa terrane was characterized by Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous magmatismThe zircon trace-element signature and Hf isotopic composition indicate that the magmatic host rocks of the 364–330 Ma detrital zircons formed in an arc-back-arc system, which resulted from the southward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys oceanic crust during Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous
