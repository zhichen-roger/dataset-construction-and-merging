Abstract – Jurassic sandstones in the Xiongcun porphyry copper–gold district, southern Lhasa subterrane, Tibet, China were analysed for petrography, major oxides and trace elements, as well as detrital zircon U–Pb and Hf isotopes, to infer their depositional age, provenance, intensity of source-rock palaeo-weathering and depositional tectonic settingThis new information provides important evidence to constrain the tectonic evolution of the southern Lhasa subterrane during the Late Triassic – Jurassic period
This new information provides important evidence to constrain the tectonic evolution of the southern Lhasa subterrane during the Late Triassic – Jurassic periodThe sandstones are exposed in the lower and upper sections of the Xiongcun Formation
The detrital zircon ages (161–243 Ma) and εHf(t) values (+10.5 to +16.2) further constrain the sandstone provenance as subduction-related Triassic–Jurassic felsic and intermediate igneous rocks from the southern Lhasa subterraneA tectonic discrimination method based on geochemical data of the sandstones, as well as detrital zircon ages from sandstones, reveals that the sandstones were most likely deposited in an oceanic island-arc setting
These results support the hypothesis that the tectonic background of the southern Lhasa subterrane was an oceanic island-arc setting, rather than a continental island-arc setting, during the Late Triassic – Jurassic period.Keywords: Jurassic, sandstone, detrital zircons, geochemistry, Lhasa terrane
Keywords: Jurassic, sandstone, detrital zircons, geochemistry, Lhasa terraneSandstones have been effectively used to constrain provenance and identify ancient tectonic settings (e.g
1b) has formed as a result of the tectonic evolution from the subduction of the Neo-Tethys oceanic slab that was initiated during Late Triassic time or even earlier (Mo et al2005b; Chu et al
2016b), to the Indian–Asian continental collision which began during Paleocene time (c65–50 Ma) (Yin & Harrison, 2000; Mo et al
Previous investigations of the southern Lhasa subterrane have focused on the initial timing of the India–Asia collision and the Cretaceous–Cenozoic magmatism and sedimentation (e.gYin & Harrison, 2000; Mo et al
By contrast, the Late Triassic – Jurassic tectonic evolution of the southern Lhasa subterrane is relatively poorly understood and even a controversial subjectOver the past few years, some studies have reported that the geological setting of the southern Lhasa subterrane was a continental island-arc setting during the Late Triassic– Jurassic period (e.g
Over the past few years, some studies have reported that the geological setting of the southern Lhasa subterrane was a continental island-arc setting during the Late Triassic– Jurassic period (e.gYang et al
To determine the early Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the southern Lhasa subterrane, most researchers have focused on the geochemistry and geochronology of the Upper Triassic – Jurassic igneous rocks distributed in the southern Lhasa subterrane; however, contemporaneous sedimentary rocks were not consideredSedimentary rocks can provide effective information with which to constrain the ancient tectonic setting, and it is also a far more reliable guide to tectonic setting than the compositions of the volcanic rocks themselves (Li et al
We therefore present in this paper the petrology, geochemical composition, detrital zircon U–Pb age and Lu–Hf isotopes of sandstones from the Lower–Middle Jurassic Xiongcun Formation within the southern Lhasa subterrane to constrain their depositional age and to deduce provenance and tectonic settingThe results provide additional information for reconstructing the tectonic evolution of the southern Lhasa subterrane during the Late Triassic – Jurassic period.
The results provide additional information for reconstructing the tectonic evolution of the southern Lhasa subterrane during the Late Triassic – Jurassic period.The Lhasa terrane is bound to the north by the Banggong–Nujiang Suture Zone (BNSZ) and to the south by the Yarlung–Zangbo Suture Zone (YZSZ; Fig
In the southern Lhasa subterrane, the sedimentary cover is limited and is mainly of the Lower Jurassic – Tertiary volcanic-sedimentary sequences (Mo et al2005b; Pan et al
The Jurassic–Cretaceous volcanic-sedimentary sequences primarily includes the Lower–Middle Jurassic Yeba and Xiongcun formations as well as the Lower Jurassic – Lower Cretaceous Sangri Group (Fig1c; Pan et al
The Tertiary volcanic-sedimentary sequence is predominantly the Paleocene–Eocene Linzizong volcanic succession, which consists of the andesitic lower Dianzhong Formation, dacitic middle Nianbo Formation and rhyolitic upper Pana Formation (Mo et al2003; Lee et al
The Late Triassic–Jurassic and Cretaceous arc volcanic rocks, granitoid intrusions, and porphyries in the southern Lhasa subterrane were formed in a subduction geologic setting (Fig1c; Chu et al
The Paleocene–Eocene Linzizong volcanism, voluminous granitoid batholiths and porphyries formed in a continental collisional geological setting (Mo et al2005b, 2008; Chu et al
The Miocene intrusions, which formed in a post-collisional geological setting and have an adakitelike affinity, were commonly emplaced as small stocks and/or dykes in the southern Lhasa subterrane (Hou et al2004; Chung et al
The strata exposed in the Xiongcun district belong to the Lower–Middle Jurassic Xiongcun Formation, which are mainly exposed near the Xiongcun village, Xietongmen County, southern Lhasa subterrane (Fig1)
The intrusive rocks in the Xiongcun district are of Jurassic and Eocene age (Fig2a; Lang et al
The Jurassic intrusions include Early Jurassic quartz diorite porphyry, Early–Middle Jurassic quartz diorite porphyry, Middle Jurassic quartz diorite porphyry and diabase dykes, and Late Jurassic gabbroThe Eocene intrusions include biotite granodiorite, quartz diorite, granitic aplite dykes and lamprophyre dykes
The Eocene intrusions include biotite granodiorite, quartz diorite, granitic aplite dykes and lamprophyre dykesThree porphyry copper–gold deposits (No
The mineralization was hosted in the Jurassic porphyries and the surrounding contemporary volcanic rocks (Tafti et al2009, 2014; Lang et al
1 deposit is associated with the Middle Jurassic quartz diorite porphyry and formed at c161.5 ± 2.7 Ma (Lang et al
2 deposit is associated with the Early Jurassic quartz diorite porphyry and formed at 174.4 ± 1.6 Ma (Lang et al2014); and the No
The whole-rock major- and trace-element concentrations of Jurassic sandstones in the Xiongcun district are listed in Table 2.As shown in Table 2, it is apparent that the sandstone samples show moderate SiO2 contents (53.27–
The Jurassic sandstones in the Xiongcun district exhibit similar REE compositions, with total REE contents ranging over 59.02–102.10 ppm (Table 2)The chondrite-normalized REE patterns (Fig

3); the lower section of Xiongcun Formation therefore probably formed during the Early Jurassic periodFor the upper section of Xiongcun Formation, Tang et al
According to the age of the diabase dykes, we propose that the upper section of Xiongcun Formation probably formed during Middle Jurassic timeIn summary, we interpret that the Xiongcun Formation formed during the Early–Middle Jurassic period (195–165 Ma).
In summary, we interpret that the Xiongcun Formation formed during the Early–Middle Jurassic period (195–165 Ma).The alteration of rocks during weathering results in the depletion of alkali and alkaline Earth elements and preferential enrichment of Al2O3 in sediments (Sun, Gui & Chen, 2012)
The high CIA and CIW values (Table 2) of the sandstones from the Xiongcun Formation indicate moderate to high weathering and tropical conditions in the source area during the Late Triassic – Jurassic period (Nesbitt & Young, 1982)In the A (Al2O3) – CN (CaO ∗ + Na2O) – K (K2O) diagram (Fig
This is supported by the palaeogeography of the Lhasa terrane that suggests a location near the equator during the Late Triassic – Jurassic period (Metcalfe, 2006).Modal abundance, whole-rock chemistry, and zircon U–Pb and Lu–Hf isotopes can provide useful constraints for the provenance of sandstones (Dickinson
Detrital zircon age data indicate that the Jurassic sandstones from the Xiongcun Formation received detritus from sources of age 161–243 MaAges in this range have been reported for igneous rocks in the central and southern Lhasa subterranes (Chu et al
However, detrital zircons from the Jurassic sandstones in the Xiongcun district show high and positive εHf(t) values (10.45–16.21), indicating that they are probably derived from igneous rocks in the southern Lhasa subterrane rather than the central LhasaFigure 10
The Triassic and Jurassic igneous rocks in the southern Lhasa subterrane have been attributed to the northwards subduction of the NeoTethys oceanic slab (Chu et al2006; Zhang et al
2015a) further supports the interpretation that the local provenance of the Jurassic sandstones in the Xiongcun Formation lacks old basement componentsIn summary, the sandstones from the Xiongcun Formation were likely derived from Triassic and Jurassic subduction-related felsic and intermediate igneous rock in the southern Lhasa subterrane.
In summary, the sandstones from the Xiongcun Formation were likely derived from Triassic and Jurassic subduction-related felsic and intermediate igneous rock in the southern Lhasa subterrane.Sandstones can be formed in tectonic settings such as oceanic island arcs, continental island arcs, active continental margins and passive margins (Bhatia, 1983, 1985; Bhatia & Crook, 1986)
The Jurassic sandstones in the Xiongcun district show: low abundances of La, Th, Zr and Nb; low ratios of Th/U and La/Sc; and high ratios of La/Th and Zr/Th (Table 2)These trace-element characteristics are very similar to those of sandstones from an oceanic islandarc setting (Bhatia & Crook, 1986)
Similarly, the Jurassic igneous rocks in the Xiongcun porphyry copper– gold district were also interpreted to have been generated within an oceanic island-arc system (Tang et al2015; Lang et al
Our data support the opinion that the southern Lhasa subterrane was likely an oceanic island-arc setting rather than a continental island-arc setting during the Late Triassic– Jurassic period.Based on petrology, geochemistry, zircon U–Pb dating and Lu–Hf results from Jurassic sandstones of the Xiongcun Formation in the Xiongcun district, we can draw the following conclusions.
Based on petrology, geochemistry, zircon U–Pb dating and Lu–Hf results from Jurassic sandstones of the Xiongcun Formation in the Xiongcun district, we can draw the following conclusions.The sandstones of Xiongcun Formation formed during Early–Middle Jurassic time (195–165 Ma)
The sandstones of Xiongcun Formation formed during Early–Middle Jurassic time (195–165 Ma)The sandstones are exposed in the lower and upper sections of the Xiongcun Formation
Detrital zircon ages and εHf(t) values further constrain the sandstones provenance as Triassic and Jurassic subduction-related felsic and intermediate igneous rocks in the southern Lhasa subterraneThe tectonic setting discrimination diagrams, as well as the chemical compositions and detrital zircon ages, support an oceanic island-arc setting for the sandstones from the Xiongcun Formation.
The geologic setting of the southern Lhasa subterrane during the Late Triassic – Jurassic period was probably an oceanic island-arc setting rather than a continental island-arc setting.Acknowledgements
