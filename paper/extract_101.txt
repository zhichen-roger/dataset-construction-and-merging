These data support the view that the Shiqiao–Pingshang low-grade metasedimentary rocks originated from the North China Craton, and underwent deformation in the Permian during subduction of the South China Craton (Yangtze block) beneath the North China CratonThis requires that the low-grade metasedimentary rocks were overthrust for several tens of kilometres onto the South China Craton, explaining why source materials from the North China Craton are common in Triassic to Jurassic sedimentary basins

(3) Late Neoproterozoic–Cambrian algal fossils have been found in the Shiqiao–Pingshang low-grade metasedimentary rocks (SBGMR 1987, 1997), and a Late Neoproterozoic (Sinian) age of 620  14 Ma was obtained from phyllite by the whole-rock Rb–Sr method (Song & Song 1997).Analyses of major element oxides and trace elements were carried out at the Analytical Institute in the Hubei Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, Wuhan

The basement rocks of the North China Craton and South China Craton record very different thermal–magmatic histories prior to amalgamation in the Early Mesozoic (Bruguier et al1997; Hacker et al

In the North China Craton, Precambrian basement rocks are dominated by Neoarchaean granitoids and orthogneisses (mostly tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite) and Palaeoproterozoic metasedimentary sequences (Jahn & Zhang 1984; Jahn & Ernst 1990; Zhao et al2000, 2002, 2005; Kusky & Li 2003; Zhai & Liu 2003; Wilde & Zhao 2005; Wilde et al

The South China Craton, especially the Yangtze block, is characterized by young basement with Meso- to Neoproterozoic agesThis was subjected to major thermal events at 1100–1000 and 850–700 Ma (Li, Z

Precambrian basement in the South China Craton is characterized by the widespread occurrence of 820–740 Ma bimodal igneous rocks that evolved in a rift setting (Hacker et al1998, 2000; Li, Z

Therefore, Neoproterozoic rift magmatism is regarded as an important signature in distinguishing the South China Craton from the North China Craton (Hacker et al1998, 2000; Ratschbacher et al

Based on this and the fact that Neoproterozoic magmatic ages are absent in the Shiqiao–Pingshang low-grade metasedimentary rocks, although they are located in the Sulu UHP belt, we conclude that the most likely source for the Shiqiao–Pingshang low-grade metasedimentary rocks is from the southern edge of North China Craton, rather than the northern edge of the South China Craton.Relationship between low-grade metamorphic and UHP rocks

On the other hand, Neoproterozoic ages between 650 and 850 Ma are common in the UHP rocks, but are absent in the Shiqiao–Pingshang low-grade metasedimentary rocks(5) New SHRIMP zircon U–Pb dates show that the peak of UHP metamorphism was between 240 and 220 Ma (Leech et al

However, there is no evidence to show that they underwent Triassic UHP metamorphism from either SHRIMP zircon or Ar– Ar muscovite dating.The age of 265 Ma for muscovite from the quartz schist at Shiqiao has not previously been recorded from the Sulu UHP belt

To test this hypothesis, it is necessary to examine data from the various Triassic to Jurassic sedimentary basins that developed around the Dabie–Sulu beltThe presence of coesite- and diamond-bearing UHP metamorphic rocks in the Dabie–Sulu belt suggests that a huge crustal section was buried, uplifted and then denuded (Nie et al

Most material eroded from the Dabie–Sulu belt appears to have accumulated in the Triassic Songpan–Ganzi Basin (Nie et al1994, 1995; Bruguier et al

One problem is to explain why so much North China Craton source material is found in these basins and why so few materials are from the UHP rocks, especially in the Triassic Songpan– Ganzi BasinMaterial from the Dabie–Sulu orogenic belt, involving erosion of the UHP rocks, would be expected to mainly provide 740–780 and 220–240 Ma detrital zircons, but this is not the case

Most overthrust North China Craton rocks were denuded between the Triassic and the present day, and only a small portion was preserved owing to their being tectonically interleaved with the UHP rocksAs a result, the remaining rocks of North China Craton affinity occur as the Shiqiao–Pingshang low-grade metasedimentary unit in the Dabie–Sulu UHP belt, in tectonic contact with the UHP rocks (Fig
