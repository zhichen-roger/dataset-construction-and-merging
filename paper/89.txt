A detrital record of lower oceanic crust exhumation within a Miocene slow-spreading ridge: Macquarie Island, Southern OceanRyan A
Sedimentary structures, detrital clinopyroxene major- and trace-element geochemistry, and 206Pb/238U zircon geochronology indicate that the gabbroic lithofacies were more distally derived from a Paleogene-aged tholeiitic MORB sourceDetrital zircon populations of ca
metric transverse ridge that was composed of structurally isolated blocks of heterogeneously aged Paleogene source crust, which provided the source for Macquarie Island’s gabbroic sedimentary lithofacies.Voluminous sedimentary sequences, up to 100 m thick, deposited within spreading-ridge basins (Karson et al., 1984) have the potential to record the genesis and exhumation of the lower oceanic crust as is commonly described in continental basins fl anking metamorphic core complexes (e.g., Dunkl et al., 1998; Wagner and Johnson, 2006)
(A) Present-day position of Macquarie Island in the Southern Ocean at 54.65°S, 158.83°ELight gray represents oceanic crust formed at the proto–Macquarie spreading ridge (PMSR)
(half rates of 4.4–28 mm/yr) separated the IndoAustralian and Pacifi c plates from the middle Eocene to late Miocene and was characterized by very short spreading corridors with longoffset transforms (>100 km) during formation of Macquarie Island crust (Massell et al., 2000; Varne et al., 2000; Mosher and Massell-Symons, 2008)The majority of rocks exposed on the island consist of enriched mid-ocean-ridge basalt (E-MORB) pillows (Kamenetsky and Maas, 2002) and, to a lesser extent, lower-crustal rocks including sheeted diabase dikes, gabbro, and serpentinized harzburgite (Goscombe and Everard, 1998)
The older ages and unusual geochemistry of the detrital zircon and clinopyroxene populations, respectively, exclude Miocene-aged igneous crust formed at the proto–Macquarie spreading ridge as a signifi cant source for the gabbroic sedimentary intervalsAny likely provenance must have contained mixed-aged crust that was not only older, but also geochemically different from the interbedded volcanic rocks of Macquarie Island.
The Resolution Ridge and Emerald fracture zone–Campbell Plateau are conjugate margins that rifted apart with the opening of the proto–Macquarie spreading ridge during the Eocene(B) Initiation of plate motion reorganization at 26.6 Ma (anomaly 8o)
Neogene crust was created at proto–Macquarie spreading ridge (PMSR), and Paleogene crust was created at Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR)Gray box in inset represents area depicted in threedimensional (3-D) block diagram.
Subsequent to >300 km of transport over ~20 m.y., heavily deformed 27–33 Ma Paleogene source crust of the Jurru transverse ridge fl anked sedimentary basins of the active Neogene Jurru-Matata spreading segment where gabbroic sedimentary rocks of Macquarie Island formed (Fig11).
Initial development of Neogene volcano-sedimentary basins within the westernmost active proto–Macquarie spreading ridge corridor is preserved by locally derived, very coarse-grained basaltic breccias that typically occur adjacent to spreading-related faultsThese spreading-related faults accommodated extension during volcanism in the active proto–Macquarie spreading ridge and long after volcanism ceased
8.5 Ma Macquarie Island gabbroic rocks currently exposed in adjacent footwalls were not exposed during fi lling of the Neogene volcanosedimentary basinsGeodynamic reconstructions show that heterogeneously aged Paleogene source crust from the Southeast Indian Ridge spreading corridor was tectonically transported over 300 km within structurally isolated blocks of the Jurru long-offset transform
Geodynamic reconstructions show that heterogeneously aged Paleogene source crust from the Southeast Indian Ridge spreading corridor was tectonically transported over 300 km within structurally isolated blocks of the Jurru long-offset transformThis transform was subjected to signifi cant transpression during this time, which produced a bathymetrically high transverse ridge
Denudation of this transverse ridge shed faulted Paleogene upper and lower oceanic crust into adjacent basins of the active proto–Macquarie spreading ridge.This manuscript was greatly improved from helpful comments by S
