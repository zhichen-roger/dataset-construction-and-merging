Numerous researchers have postulated that northern India was involved in ophiolite obduction, arc–continent, or continent–continent collision during the Late Cretaceous or Early Paleocene, but firm geological evidence was never producedIn this article we argue against orogenic events predating the Late Paleocene, when the Neotethys Ocean was still open
In this article we argue against orogenic events predating the Late Paleocene, when the Neotethys Ocean was still openThe Tethys Himalayan sedimentary record testifies to anorogenic evolution, primarily controlled by dynamic uplift of the passive margin prior to the massive outburst of Deccan lavas and eventually followed by thermal subsidence
magmatic episode started to affect the base of the Indian Plate in the Campanian or possibly even in the Santonian, 10 to 20 Ma before the climax of Deccan flood-basalt eruptionsThe abrupt increase in siliciclastic supply and accumulation rates recorded in sedimentary basins all around the Indian subcontinent during the Maastrichtian was followed by progradation of coastal quartzarenites along the northern Indian margin in the Early Paleocene

Felsitic volcanic rock fragments and Cr-spinels, many of which with the same geochemical fingerprint as Deccan spinels and newly found throughout the Maastrichtian to Danian succession, resisted the combined effect of subequatorial weathering and subsequent diagenesis, and testify that detritus from Deccan basalts reached the Indian passive margin as far as South TibetAt the close of the Early Paleocene India drifted away from the Seychelles block, and thermal subsidence led to widespread carbonate deposition along the Tethys Himalaya

The Late Cretaceous sedimentary evolution of the Indian continental margin facing Neotethys (Tethys Himalaya) has long been suspected to record a major tectonic event (Fig1; Searle et al., 1987; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Murphy and Yin, 2003)
Other authors have favored an early collision between India and Asia, based on the supposed Eurasian character of Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary terrestrial faunas in India (Jaeger et al.,1989), detrital geochronology (Cai et al., 2011), or paleomagnetic data (Yi et al., 2011)
Alternatively, and without postulating any extraneous hypothetical entity, the Tethys Himalaya succession may have simply recorded the major anorogenic event that affected the Indian subcontinent at the close of the Cretaceous (Gaetani and Garzanti, 1991; “Model 1” of Hu et al., 2012).In this article we present first a concise description of the Cretaceous to Paleocene Tethys Himalayan stratigraphic record (Fig
In this article we present first a concise description of the Cretaceous to Paleocene Tethys Himalayan stratigraphic record (Fig2)
Numerous articles envisaged orogenic evolution of northern India in the Late Cretaceous, by either arc–continent collision (e.g., Chatterjee et al., 2013) or ophiolite obduction (e.g., Corfield et al., 2001)Continuing passive-margin evolution (Stampfli and Borel, 2002) is a simpler alternative scenario that avoids inferences to unknown entities.

Upper Cretaceous/Lower Paleocene stratigraphy of the Tethys Himalaya in South Tibet (Willems et al., 1996; Wan et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2012) and Zanskar (Gaetani et al., 1986; Garzanti et al., 1987; Nicora et al., 1987; Premoli Silva et al., 1991)Position of samples analyzed for sandstone petrography, spinel geochemistry and U–Pb zircon geochronology is indicated
Ubiquitous unconformities and extensive faunal reworking all along the northern Indian margin suggest that subsidence ceased and was probably inverted since Campanianthe succession has been eroded away
Only Lower Cretaceous strata are preserved in Nepal, and only in the Thakkhola Graben (Garzanti, 1999)In the following section we will focus on the most complete sections exposed in Zanskar and South Tibet, where the Tethys Himalaya is traditionally subdivided into a southern proximal subzone (including the Gamba and Tingri localities) and a northern distal subzone dominated by deep-water sediments and turbidites
In the Lower Cretaceous, feldspatho–quartzose to quartzo-feldspatho– lithic volcaniclastic sandstones and interbedded mudrocks document uplift associated with volcanic eruptions south of the Tethys Himalaya(Garzanti, 1993a,b; Hu et al., 2010)
Besides variations in lithology related to the location of river mouths and climatic zonation (progressively higher southernhemisphere paleolatitudes from west to east), Upper Cretaceoussuccessions compare closely from Zanskar to South Tibet
Gray to multicolored foraminiferal oozes were deposited at upper bathyal depths during the latest Albian to Campanian times (Chikkim and Fatu La Formations)Stratigraphic thickness increases from 56 m in the inner margin to ≥200 m oceanward, indicating average accumulation rates ranging from only 2 m/Ma to 7 m/Ma offshore
Hiatuses are most common in the Cenomanian (100–94 Ma), whereas rapid accumulation below the mudline took place in the early TuronianHiatuses and marked variation in thickness of diverse foraminiferal zones also characterize Coniacian/Santonian strata (90–84 Ma), where the occurrence of benthic foraminifers and macrofossils (belemnites, inoceramids, echinoderms) suggests the beginning of a shallowing trend

The sharp upward transition to the Kangi La Formation testifies to a turning point in passive-margin evolution around the Campanian/ Maastrichtian boundary (~72 Ma), with a very pronounced increase in terrigenous supply and accumulation rates (~100 m/Ma)The unit, 500–600 m thick (Gaetani et al., 1986), is progressively replaced in the outer margin by the several hundred m-thick Goma Shale, capped by 30–35 m of silty marls with phosphatic nodules (Kubar La Fm.; Fig
Rich faunas (benthic foraminifers, algae, corals, echinoderms, ostracods) indicate open shallow-marine deposition at the close of the Maastrichtian.Above the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary (~66 Ma), a quartzarenite marker horizon increasing in thickness from 6 m to 67 m offshore is interpreted as an aggrading mesotidal shoreline complex (Stumpata Quartzarenite; Nicora et al., 1987)

Petrography of Maastrichtian to Paleocene sandstones from Tibet to Pakistan (Umar, 2008) indicates anorogenic setting and rejects both ophiolite-obduction and arc– continent-collision scenariosA: Quartzose Tethys Himalayan sandstones (39 samples point-counted by the Gazzi–Dickinson method; dataset provided in Appendix Table A1) differ sharply from sands shed by the Oman ophiolites or Taiwan orogen, and compare instead with sands of African passive margins (compositional fields after Garzanti et al., 2002, 2014a,b)

(2002), the top of the unit consists of 3.7 m-thick calcareous sandstones with gastropods, ostracods and benthic foraminifers, followed by sandstones, sandy limestones and marls yielding planktonic foraminifers of Danian ageThe overlying 75 m-thick Jidula Formation consists of sandstones and calcareous sandstones with a shale interval in the middle and interbedded with marly nodular limestones with ferruginous nodules at the top, indicating deposition in deltaic to shallow-marine environments (Fig
The fauna includes gastropods, ostracods and a few foraminifers suggesting an early Danian age (Fig3; Wan et al., 2002)
The sharp transgressive upper boundary is overlain by thick shallow-marine carbonates of the Zongpu Formation, yielding in the lower part foraminifers of the latest Danian age (~62 Ma; Willems, 1993; Wan et al., 2002).In the Gamba area, 424 m of dark gray marls and marly limestones increasing at the top were deposited in the late Albian to Santonian times (Lengqingre and Gambacunkou Formations; Willems et al., 1996)

A paraconformity at the top, best observed in the Gamba Castle section, is followed by the ~170 m-thick Zongshan Formation of Maastrichtian ageMarls and nodular marly limestones with reworked fossils intercalated with storm-surge turbidites in the lower 50 m are overlain by limestones yielding calcareous algae and benthic foraminifers interbedded with rudist biostromes and subordinate marls (Fig
A 2–5 cm-thick mudrock near the base of the unit yielded foraminifers of the early Danian age (Wan et al., 2002)The Zongshan and Jidula Formations record an overall shallowing-upward trend from mixed siliciclastic–carbonate rocks deposited in offshore environments to shallow-marine carbonates and coastal sandstones
The overlying transgressive shallow-marine carbonates of the Zongpu Formation are dated in the lower part at the latest Danian (~62 Ma; Willems, 1993; Wan et al., 2002).Arguments against the hypothesis that ophiolites of the IndusYarlung Suture were emplaced onto the northern Indian margin in the Late Cretaceous include:
Arguments against the hypothesis that ophiolites of the IndusYarlung Suture were emplaced onto the northern Indian margin in the Late Cretaceous include:patterns of magnetic anomalies in the Indian Ocean
Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene units of the Tethys Himalaya do not contain ophiolitic detritusSiltstones and sandstones are invariably quartzose, indicating cratonic provenance from the south rather than ophiolitic provenance from the north (Fig

Cr-spinel geochemistry indicates that the Yarlung– Tsangpo ophiolites were not exposed to erosion until after the Early Eocene (Hu et al., 2014);U–Pb age spectra of detrital zircons in the Jidula and Stumpata quartzarenites indicate provenance from India in the south (Fig
the obduction hypothesis was based on erroneous earlier descriptions of the Maastrichtian Kangi La Formation, interpreted as a “flysch” (Fuchs, 1977; Brookfield and Andrews-Speed, 1984) supposedly indicating “a notable deepening event” and the “collapse of the stable Mesozoic shelf” (Searle et al., 1987, p679, 695)
field observations made by several independent research teams and finding of faunas of the Early Eocene age in the mélange at the base of the ophiolitic klippe (Reuber et al., 1987) indicate that obduction could not have taken place before the Eocene (Kelemen et al., 1988 p129).
As a further argument, the supra-subduction origin of most Himalayan ophiolites is indicated by petrological and geochemical evidence (Hébert et al., 2012), as well as by stratigraphic continuity of the upper Barremian/Aptian succession at the top of the ophiolite, including pillow basalts and cherts overlain by thick turbidites of the Xigaze forearc basin (Wang et al., 2012; An et al., in press)As part of forearc basement, the Xigaze Ophiolite belonged by definition to the northern active margin of Neotethys, and its obduction onto the Tethys Himalayan passive margin could not have occurred before the intervening ocean closed and the two margins began to collide.
Ophiolite obduction did take place around the Cretaceous/Paleocene boundary along the western transform margin of the Indian Plate (Gnos et al., 1998; Beck et al., 1996; Khan and Clyde, 2013), but this well documented event does not automatically imply that ophiolites were obducted at the same time onto the northern Indian margin as well (Rowley, 1996 p5)
Arguments against the hypothesis that India collided with Asia in the Late Cretaceous include several of those discussed in the previous section:no slowdown is observed in the convergence between India and Asia
Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene units of the Tethys Himalaya do not contain any orogenic detritusQuartzose sands were supplied all along the Indian margin from rivers draining India in the south, and not derived from hypothetical Asian or arc sources in the north (Fig
independent subsidence analyses, failing to provide evidence of subsidence acceleration, do not support such postulated Late Cretaceous collision (Rowley, 1998; Hu et al., 2012; Sciunnach and Garzanti, 2012);earlier descriptions of the Kangi La Formation as “consisting of more than 1000 m of deep-water shale and olistostromes” interpreted as “syn-emplacement flysch deposits accumulating in the foredeep of the Indian Plate margin” (Searle, 1986 p
This interpretation has been subsequently emended by the same authors, who finally recognized that the lowermost Paleocene Jidula sandstones are passivemargin sediments consisting of Indian-derived detritus, and that the India/Asia collision took place only much later at ~56 Ma (Zhang et al., 2012 p186–187)
Closure of Neotethys in the Late Cretaceous is in fact hardly compatible with stable carbonate-platform deposition all along the Indian margin during the whole of the Paleocene (Willems, 1993; Rowley, 1996; Zhang et al., 2012 p183).
(2011) have favored Maastrichtian collision onset based on an influx of zircon grains with Cretaceous ages in the Zongzhuo Mélange of the northern Tethys HimalayaFurther investigations, however, have demonstrated that zircon grains in the same mélange have U–Pb ages as young as 56 Ma (Sun et al., 2011)
Asian-sourced detritus was thus being deposited in deep waters onto the distal Indian margin around the Paleocene/Eocene boundary, when Neotethys was about to close.Recent studies have documented transition from endemic to cosmopolitan terrestrial faunas not earlier than the Early Eocene, consistent with India–Asia collision close to the Paleocene–Eocene boundary (Clyde et al., 2003; Chatterjee and Scotese, 2010; Clementz et al., 2011).
Recent studies have documented transition from endemic to cosmopolitan terrestrial faunas not earlier than the Early Eocene, consistent with India–Asia collision close to the Paleocene–Eocene boundary (Clyde et al., 2003; Chatterjee and Scotese, 2010; Clementz et al., 2011).Subsidence analysis was carried out from the base of the Gambacunkou Formation (~100 Ma) to the top of the Zongpu Formation (~50 Ma) using the MATLAB code provided by Allen and Allen (2005)
The curve obtained for the Tingri section suggests steady subsidence until Santonian times (Fig7)
Notably reduced subsidence during the major Campanian hiatus was seemingly followed by tectonic uplift of 300 ± 200 m during deposition of the Zhepure Shanpo and Jidula Formations (Hu et al., 2012)Ceased and possibly inverted subsidence remains indicated even if the shallowest values are conservatively assumed for the top of the Jiubao Formation, a pattern that cannot be ascribed entirely to waning thermal subsidence ~30 Ma after the end of the Early Cretaceous volcanic event (Zhu et al., 2008)
Ceased and possibly inverted subsidence remains indicated even if the shallowest values are conservatively assumed for the top of the Jiubao Formation, a pattern that cannot be ascribed entirely to waning thermal subsidence ~30 Ma after the end of the Early Cretaceous volcanic event (Zhu et al., 2008)However, the curves obtained by Rowley (1998) based on the data from Willems et al
Whether tectonic uplift was associated with the Campanian turning point in sedimentary evolution is even more difficult to establish for the Zanskar succession, where Maastrichtian deposits are much thicker (Fig3)
Much depends on Santonian– Campanian water depths, which imply uplift if assumed to be N300 m but subsidence if assumed to be b200 m (Garzanti et al., 2005).A multifold increase of clastic supply during the Maastrichtian is testified not only by the Tethys Himalayan succession from Zanskar to South Tibet, but around most of the Indian subcontinent as well (Saunders et al., 2007; Sahu et al., 2013)
A multifold increase of clastic supply during the Maastrichtian is testified not only by the Tethys Himalayan succession from Zanskar to South Tibet, but around most of the Indian subcontinent as well (Saunders et al., 2007; Sahu et al., 2013)A three- to five-fold increase in sediment flux during the late Campanian–early Maastrichtian times is recorded in sedimentary basins of southeastern India, and ascribed to an increase in topography in catchment areas to the northwest (Halkett et al., 2001; Lakshminarayana, 2002)
A three- to five-fold increase in sediment flux during the late Campanian–early Maastrichtian times is recorded in sedimentary basins of southeastern India, and ascribed to an increase in topography in catchment areas to the northwest (Halkett et al., 2001; Lakshminarayana, 2002)Uplift, erosion and increased sediment fluxes across northwestern India are documented by fluvial sandstones inferred to have been derived from the rejuvenated Aravalli highlands (Gombos et al., 1995; Roy, 2003)
The lack of substantial sedimentation in southern India and missing Paleocene deposits in the Mahanadi and Godavari valleys of eastern and western central India are consistent with widespread erosion and sediment bypassing during the terminal Cretaceous crustal up-warp, possibly recorded in regions as far away as eastern Africa (Bosellini, 1989).In the Kirthar and Suleiman Ranges of western Pakistan, at the western end of the Himalayan belt, upper bathyal to shelfal limestones of Turonian–Campanian age are overlain by a shallowing and coarseningupward Maastrichtian succession including shelfal to fluvio-deltaic sandstones and pebbly sandstones (Mughal Kot and Pab Formations; Eschard et al., 2004)

High-Ti detrital spinels in Maastrichtian to Danian sandstones of the Tethys Himalaya (dataset provided in Appendix Table A3) are virtually identical to spinels in Deccan basalts (data from Melluso et al., 2010), but markedly different from spinels in residual mantle peridotites or arc-related volcanic rocksThis confirms provenance from subcontinental India, and rules out erosion of ophiolites supposedly obducted onto the Indian margin in the Late Cretaceous

Cretaceous basalts and volcaniclastic sandstones are overlain unconformably by Paleocene quartzarenites, indicating non-deposition or erosion during the Late Cretaceous (Sakai, 1989; Alam et al., 2003).The Kangi La Formation exposed in the Zanskar-Spiti Synclinorium lacks sandstones
Maastrichtian sandstones exposed in the Kirthar and Suleiman Ranges are quartzose with weathered feldspars (mostly K-feldspar including microcline)Mafic volcanic rock fragments, inferred to have been derived from the erosion of Deccan lavas, increase upward, reaching 30 percent of detritus in the south (Fig
The U–Pb age distribution of the Tingri sample shows two major Early Cretaceous (109–145 Ma; 28 percent of 72 analyzed grains) and Cambrian/ late Ediacaran clusters (482–572 Ma; 15 percent)Precambrian ages fall in the 679–985 Ma (15 percent), 1075–1417 Ma (18 percent), 1644–2081 Ma (10 percent), 2268–2672 Ma (10 percent) and 3254–3362 Ma (4 percent) ranges

The simple anorogenic scenario for the Tethys Himalaya in the latest Cretaceous/ earliest Paleocene (reconstruction adapted from Cande and Stegman, 2011)Passivemargin evolution of northern India is indicated by stratigraphic and mineralogical data, while ophiolite obduction was taking place along the western transpressive boundary of theIndian plate, from Oman (Masirah)to western Pakistan (Bela, Muslim Bagh, Waziristan; Beck et al., 1996; Gnos et al., 1997).
Early Cretaceous and Cambrian peaks are typical of zircon-age spectra from Tethys Himalayan sandstones (Gehrels et al., 2011), confirming Indian provenance from the south (Fig6)
Specifically, Early Cretaceous zircon ages, more abundant in South Tibet but common in Zanskar as well, reflect the megavolcanic event documented throughout northern India at that time (Sakai, 1989; Garzanti, 1993a,b; Hu et al., 2010), whereas Cambrian zircon ages reflect widespread felsic intrusions during the Pan-African orogeny (Garzanti et al., 1986; Gehrels et al., 2003; Cawood et al., 2007)Older zircons were ultimately derived from Precambrian rocks exposed in the Indian subcontinent farther to the south, including the Neoproterozoic Malani felsic volcanics and Erinpura granites, magmatic or metamorphic rocks of the Mesoproterozoic Delhi and Paleoproterozoic Aravalli orogenic cycles, and subordinately from the Archean craton stabilized by 2.5 Ma (Mondal et al., 2002; Malone et al., 2008; Kaur et al., 2011; Mishra and Ravi Kumar, 2014).

Many Cr-spinels in the Jidula Formation show closer affinities to Cr-spinels in Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastic rocks of the Tethys Himalaya (Wölong Formation; Jadoul et al., 1998; Hu et al., 2010, 2014), but several are still identified as Deccan-derivedAlong with the common occurrence of detrital zircons with Lower Cretaceous ages, this indicates recycling of Mesozoic cover strata of the Indian margin, increasing progressively with time during deposition of the upper Zhepure Shanpo and Jidula Formations.
Along with the common occurrence of detrital zircons with Lower Cretaceous ages, this indicates recycling of Mesozoic cover strata of the Indian margin, increasing progressively with time during deposition of the upper Zhepure Shanpo and Jidula Formations.After several hundred kilometers of orogenic shortening, Tethys Himalayan sedimentary rocks lie today between 1000 and 1500 km from the center of Deccan activity and ~500 km from the northernmost volcanic centers known, and paleomagnetic analyses indicate a latitudinal separation corresponding to an original distance possibly reaching 2000 km or more (van Hinsbergen et al., 2011, 2012)
Subsidence analysis of the Gamba and Tingri sections suggests uplift of the sea floor since Campanian times (Fig7; Hu et al., 2012)
The widespread Campanian hiatus associated with extensive reworking by oceanic currents and faunal mixing (Fig3) represents circumstantial evidence of inverted subsidence in Zanskar as well, but insufficiently precise assessment of paleobathymetry prevented us to conclusively establish whether tectonic uplift did affect the northwestern Indian margin directly (Sciunnach and Garzanti, 2012)

Along with the upwardincreasing abundance of Cr-spinels displaying chemical affinity with Lower Cretaceous magmatic rocks, they indicate erosion and recycling of Mesozoic sedimentary and volcanic cover strata of the inner Indian margin (e.g., Lesser Himalaya) and rejuvenation of the Pan African OrogenBecause such sources lay not far south of the presently exposed Tethys Himalaya, this represents further evidence of dynamic uplift of the Indian passive margin at the close of the Cretaceous.
Because such sources lay not far south of the presently exposed Tethys Himalaya, this represents further evidence of dynamic uplift of the Indian passive margin at the close of the Cretaceous.Whereas surface uplift may be difficult to prove conclusively, erosion is certainly not
And the multifold increase of terrigenous supply recorded around the Indian subcontinent in the Maastrichtian, just before the outburst of Deccan lavas, speaks loudly in favor of uplift associated with magmatic upwellingSudden arrival along the Tethys Himalayan margin of large volumes of terrigenous detritus from India, including up to very-coarse-grained sand (Fig
The quartzose composition of Maastrichtian/Danian siltstones and sandstones is ascribed to the combined effect of recycling, intense weathering in humid subequatorial climate, and subsequent diagenetic dissolution leading to selective breakdown of less durable grains (Fig5B, C; Garzanti et al., 2013)
But common felsitic volcanic rock fragments and Cr-spinel, found recurrently in Maastrichtian to Daniansandstones, remain as faithful witnesses of continuous volcaniclastic supplyGeochemical fingerprints virtually identical to Deccan spinels (Fig
The earliest tholeiitic lavas were erupted at 67 Ma in the north of the Deccan province, whereas the most voluminous eruptions correspond broadly in time with the Cretaceous/ Paleocene boundary at 66 Ma (Hofmann et al., 2000; Chenet et al., 2007; Keller et al., 2011)The thick lava pile shows southward overstepping by progressively younger units, and magmatism was younger by some 1–2 Ma in the southwest (Jerram and Widdowson, 2005)
Multifold increase in clastic supply from continental India during the Maastrichtian has no more plausible cause than enhanced erosion promoted by tectonic uplift associated with upwelling magmasEqually evident is the perfect coincidence in time between the ubiquitous latest Danian transgression along the Tethys Himalaya and the onset of rapid thermal subsidence while India drifted away from the Seychelles block and Deccan magmatism eventually ceased.
Equally evident is the perfect coincidence in time between the ubiquitous latest Danian transgression along the Tethys Himalaya and the onset of rapid thermal subsidence while India drifted away from the Seychelles block and Deccan magmatism eventually ceased.Although the results of subsidence analysis remain partly ambiguous, extensive faunal reworking and widespread hiatuses point to generalized uplift of the sea floor during the Campanian (Fig

Hardgrounds and appearance of macrofossils in Santonian pelagic limestones of Zanskar and Spiti suggest that surface swelling might have started here as early as ~85 Ma, almost 20 Ma before the climax of Deccan volcanismAlternatively, this Santonian event may reflect an earlier distinct episode of dynamic uplift, associated with the separation of the India–Seychelles block from Madagascar and onset of spreading and volcanism in the Mascarene Basin (Bernard and Munschy, 2000; Torsvik et al., 2000; Calvès et al., 2011).

The Cretaceous to Lower Paleocene succession of the Tethys Himalaya records an entirely anorogenic evolution that both began and ended with flood-basaltic eruptionsUplift associated with emplacement of the Rajmahal Traps (Garzanti, 1993b; Zhu et al., 2008) was followed by thermal subsidence and quasi-synchronous shelf drowning at the end of the Early Cretaceous
Uplift associated with emplacement of the Rajmahal Traps (Garzanti, 1993b; Zhu et al., 2008) was followed by thermal subsidence and quasi-synchronous shelf drowning at the end of the Early CretaceousWidespread deposition of upper-bathyal foraminiferal oozes ensued
A similar cycle was repeated at the end of the Late CretaceousThe widespread Campanian hiatus associated with resuspension and faunal reworking was followed by a major pulse of terrigenous supply and drastic increase in accumulation rates
The widespread Campanian hiatus associated with resuspension and faunal reworking was followed by a major pulse of terrigenous supply and drastic increase in accumulation ratesThis major erosional event recorded across the Indian subcontinent is ascribed to magmatic upwelling at the base of the Indian lithosphere, begun around 80–75 Ma or even some Ma earlier
The shallowing-upward Maastrichtian succession of the Tethys Himalaya is capped by Lower Paleocene coastal quartzarenites testifying to rejuvenation of the Indian subcontinent in the southVolcanic rock fragments and Cr-spinels virtually identical geochemically to Deccan spinels resisted the coupled effect of strong weathering at subequatorial latitudes and subsequent diagenetic dissolution, and are preserved throughout the Maastrichtian to Danian succession
Volcanic rock fragments and Cr-spinels virtually identical geochemically to Deccan spinels resisted the coupled effect of strong weathering at subequatorial latitudes and subsequent diagenetic dissolution, and are preserved throughout the Maastrichtian to Danian successionThis “smoking-gun” evidence proves that detritus from Deccan lavas reached the passive margin of northern India (Fig
At the close of the Danian (~62 Ma), transgression of marine carbonates documents a synchronous drowning event all along the Tethys HimalayaThermal subsidence took place at the same time as India moved away from the magma source and Deccan volcanism eventually ceased
The sedimentary record of the northern Indian margin excludes any postulated orogenic event associated with ophiolite obduction, arc–continent or continent–continent collision in the Late Cretaceous, and indicates that Neotethys remained open until the end of the Paleocene.Supplementary data to this article, found online at  include the complete datasets on sandstone petrography (Table A1), zircon geochronology (Table A2) and spinel geochemistry (Table A3), along with the Appendix “Provenance of Cr-spinels in the Zhepure Shanpo and Jidula Formations: a rigorous statistical approach”.
