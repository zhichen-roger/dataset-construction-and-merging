Combining these fission-track data and the published geologic, sedimentological, and thermochronologic data from the northern Qilian Shan and Hexi Corridor, we propose a progressively north-northeastward growth model for the northernmost part of Tibet, suggesting that deformation in the inner Qilian Shan occurred synchronously in the middle Miocene, and subsequently, increasingly further north.The collision between India and Eurasia resulted in widespread deformation throughout the continental interior of Eurasia, producing the crust-thickened Tibetan Plateau and its deformed surrounding regions (e.g., Molnar and Tapponnier, 1975; Tapponnier and Molnar, 1979)

Several prior works concluded that early, collision-age defor ma tion occurred not only in southern Tibet near the India-Eurasia collision zone, but also in northern Tibet (e.g., Clark et al., 2010; Clark, 2012; Dayem et al., 2009), whereas others share the view that crustal thickening resulting from India’s northward advance into Eurasia has propagated northward in time, first accumulating at the plate boundary and starting in the Miocene to Plio-Quaternary in northern Tibet (e.g., Meyer et al., 1998; Tapponnier et al., 2001; Royden et al., 2008; Molnar and Stock, 2009)Although a growing body of evidence for the deformation timing and styles in different parts of Tibet has been achieved, further work is needed to understand the mechanism of crustal thickening of the plateau.

Several studies have been conducted to constrain the depositional histories and evolution of these intermountain basins, suggesting both earlier Cenozoic tectonic activity during the Eocene–Oligocene (e.g., Dupont-Nivet et al., 2004; Horton et al., 2004; Dai et al., 2006) and Miocene crustal shortening in the northern Tibetan Plateau (e.g., Fang et al., 2003, 2007; Lease et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011, 2013, 2016a, 2016b)Thermochronologic exhumation records in the elongated mountain ranges show that uplift occurred both in the early Cenozoic, during the Eocene (e.g., Jolivet et al., 2001; Clark et al., 2010; Duvall et al., 2011), and also in the late Cenozoic (e.g., George et al., 2001; Zheng et al., 2006, 2010; Lease et al., 2011)

In the inner and western Qilian Shan, these data indicate that the exhumation response to Cenozoic thrust and reverse faulting was insufficient to yield completely reset ages (George et al., 2001; Jolivet et al., 2001)The Qilian Shan is large, extending between the Qaidam Basin to the south and the Hexi Corridor to the north, entailing a width of ~300 km and length of >1000 km

Widespread middle Miocene deformation, as indicated by accelerated erosion and deposition not only in the northern Qilian Shan, but also in the southern Qilian Shan (Zhuang et al., 2018), northern Qaidam Basin (Fang et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2017), and western Qaidam Basin (e.g., Chang et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017), may therefore be inconsistent with a simple model of northward growth for northern TibetWidespread middle Miocene deformation across northern Tibet is consistent with the predicted timing of initial rapid outward growth driven by removal of mantle lithosphere from beneath Tibet (England and Houseman, 1989; Molnar and Stock, 2009).

Widespread middle Miocene deformation across northern Tibet is consistent with the predicted timing of initial rapid outward growth driven by removal of mantle lithosphere from beneath Tibet (England and Houseman, 1989; Molnar and Stock, 2009).This work provides new constraints on the onset of rapid cooling in northern Tibet by AFT thermochronometry in samples collected from the Tuolai Shan, one of the WNW- to NW-trending elongated mountain ranges in the Qilian Shan
