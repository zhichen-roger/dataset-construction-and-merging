ABSTRACT: The shallow marine Lower Jurassic quartz arenites of the Stø Formation in the southern Barents Sea comprise (1) intervals where dispersed detrital clay is absent, and where the spacing between clay-rich laminae that evolved into stylolites upon burial is exceptionally large, up to several meters, and (2) intervals where minor detrital clay matrix occurs, clay laminae are very common, and stylolite spacing is typically less than a centimeterPoint counting of thin sections and cathodoluminescence micrographs shows that quartz cement contents are far lower in the intervals where stylolite spacing is exceptionally large, 4–11 percent, versus 10–20 percent outside these intervals
The Lower Jurassic Stø Formation is 84 m thick in well 7120/6-1 and comprises very fine-, fine-, and medium-grained sandstones plus a few thin intervals of shale, and conglomeratic sandstone and phosphate nodule lag deposits (Fig2)
However, as is typically the case in the Hammerfest Basin, Paleocene sediments are overlain by Pleistocene deposits in well 7120/6-1, probably reflecting largescale Tertiary erosion and uplift (Berglund et al1986; Nyland et al
The incomplete Upper Cretaceous stratigraphy suggests that erosional events may also have occurred during this periodThe Stø Formation is presently overlain by Oxfordian shales deposited in an offshore setting, and conformably overlies the interbedded lower-delta-plain sandstones, siltstones, and shales of the Lower Jurassic Nordmela Formation.
The Stø Formation is presently overlain by Oxfordian shales deposited in an offshore setting, and conformably overlies the interbedded lower-delta-plain sandstones, siltstones, and shales of the Lower Jurassic Nordmela Formation.Samples were taken from the depth range 2397.70–2468.02 mRKB or 2060.70–2131.02 m below the sea floor
Present temperature at 2398 mRKB is approximately 848CThe Stø Formation in well 7120/6-1 is gasfilled from the top down to 2425.8 mRKB and oil-filled from this level down to 2440.3 mRKB
Owing to major uplift and erosion, constructing a reliable temperature history from the present stratigraphy is possible only from the time of deposition to the CenomanianPreserved sediments younger than Cenomanian are of Campanian, Paleocene, and Pleistocene age
Preserved sediments younger than Cenomanian are of Campanian, Paleocene, and Pleistocene ageJudging by data from other wells and previous studies of uplift indicators in the area (Berglund et al
1992), it is most likely that little sediment was deposited in the Turonian to Santonian whereas considerable deposition and uplift may have taken place in the Campanian to MaastrichtianHowever, the main episode of deep burial and uplift took place in the Tertiary
