Provenance analysis of upper Cretaceous strata in the Tethys Himalaya, southern Tibet: Implications for timing of India–Asia collisionKey Laboratory of Continental Collision and Plateau Uplift, Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100085, China
However, the initiation age of India–Asia collision is controversial and ranges from the latest Cretaceous (Willems et al., 1996; Yin and Harrison, 2000) to the middle Eocene (Burg etal.,1987;Dingetal.,2005;Searleetal.,1987,Zhuetal.,2005a).Recently, Aitchison's group proposed an alternative multistage collision model that intra-oceanic arc collision and ophiolite obduction with Indian plate occurredduringearlyCenozoicfollowedbyultimatelyIndia–Asiacollision at Eocene/Oligocene boundary (Aitchison, 2000; Aitchison and Davis,2004;Aitchisonetal.,2007a;Davisetal.,2002).ThisalternativeIndia–Asia collision model requires that the southernmost margin of Lhasa terrane retained its approximate present position at ~30°N deduced from Apparent Polar Wander Path of the stable Eurasian plate (Ali and Aitchison, 2004, 2006)
That is in conflict with recent paleomagnetic results from the Paleocene–Eocene Linzizong Group and dykes indicating thatsouthernmostmarginresidedatlowlatitudes of~10°N–~20°N(Chen et al., 2010; Dupont-Nivet et al., 2010; Liebke et al., 2010)Thus, a later collision at ~35 Ma as suggested by Aitchison et al
Provenance studies on Eocene strata of the Tethys Himalaya indicated the presence of detritus from the Asian plate suggesting that India–Asia collision had occurred by this time (Ding et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2005a)Rapid changes in sedimentation patterns (Willems et al., 1996) and tectonic subsidence (Rowley, 1998), along with the influx of accretionary prism and trench materials have been found in late Masstrichtian strata in southernTibet (Tingri and Gyangze) and have been attributed to initial India–Asia collision (Liu and Einsele, 1996; Willems et al., 1996; Yin and Harrison, 2000)
However, the lack of evidence for unambiguously Asiaderived detritus in the upper Cretaceous strata of the Tethys Himalaya questioned this early age for collision in southern Tibet.In this paper, we carried out a detailed provenance study on the upper Cretaceous clastic sedimentary rocks of the northern Tethys Himalaya, near Gyangze, southern Tibet and present new detrital zircons U–Pb–Hf isotopic, Cr–spinel electronic microprobe, bulk rock Nd-isotopic, and modal sandstone petrographic data

The Lhasa terrane was contiguous with Gondwanaland during the Paleozoic (Dewey et al., 1988; Yin et al., 2010)The basement in the few places where it is exposed is mid-Proterozoic to early Cambrian in age (Dewey et al., 1988; Guynn et al., 2006; Harris et al., 1988), and the cover consists mainly of upper Paleozoic to Tertiary sedimentary and volcanogenic strata (Yin and Harrison, 2000 and references therein)

Moreover, recent work suggested that arc magmatism initiated as early as Jurassic time (Chu et al., 2006)The Linzizong Group is weakly deformed and lies on strongly shortened (N50 percent) Cretaceous and older strata (Allegre et al., 1984; Burg and Chen, 1984; Kapp et al., 2007; Murphy et al
The Linzizong Group is weakly deformed and lies on strongly shortened (N50 percent) Cretaceous and older strata (Allegre et al., 1984; Burg and Chen, 1984; Kapp et al., 2007; Murphy et al1997; Tapponnier et al., 1981)
The Gangdese forearc basin exposed along the southern margin of the Lhasa terrane includes Albian– Ypresian marine sediments (Ding et al., 2005; Wan et al., 1997) that were mainly derived from the Gangdese arc (Dürr, 1996; Wu et al., 2010).The Yarlung Zangbo suture zone represents remnants of an oceanic basin between the India and Lhasa terranes that closed by northward subduction beneath the Lhasa terrane and possibly one or more oceanic island arc terranes
It consists of late Jurassic to early Cretaceous opholitic rocks of back-arc and intra-oceanic arc affinities (Bedard et al., 2009; Dubois-Côté et al., 2005; Gopel et al., 1984; Malpas et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2003), associated accretionary prism rocks (Wang et al., 1999), late Jurassic to early Cretaceous island arc volcanic rocks (Aitchison et al., 2007b; McDermid et al., 2002), and Paleogene molasse sediments (Davis et al., 2002).The Tethys Himalaya can be split into southern and northern units based on the presence of major intervening structures and differences in lithology across the Lhagoi Kangri Anticline (Burg et al., 1987)
The southern unit is composed mainly of Proterozoic to Eocene carbonate and clastic sedimentary rocks (Wang et al., 2002; Willems et al., 1996; Zhu et al., 2005a)The deformation and metamorphism of these strata are usually weak
The northern unit consists of Proterozoic to Eocene sandstone, shale, chert and limestone that underwent major shortening and low grade metamorphism (Burg et al., 1985; Chen et al., 2011; Ding et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005a, 2005b Liu and Einsele, 1994, 1996, Wan et al., 2005)A belt of gneiss domes lies along the axis of the Lhagoi Kangri Anticline in the middle part of the Tethys Himalaya and consists of medium- to high-grade metamorphic rocks and Cambrian–Ordovician granites(Leeetal.,2000)and30–10 Maleucogranites(Zhangetal.,2004)

The upper Cretaceous strata deposited on the Indian passive continental margin in the Gyangze area of south–central Tibet (Fig2) are divided from older to younger into the Jiabula Formation, Chuangde Formation and Zongzhuo Formation (Fig
Belemnite and radiolaria indicate an age of Cenomanian to Coniacian for this formation (Li et al., 2005a, 2005b; Wang et al., 2005).Fig
Planktonic foraminifera and radiolaria indicate a Santonian to Masstrichtian age for the formation (Li et al., 2011; Wan et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005).The Zongzhuo Formation sits conformably on the Chuangde Formation and is predominantly composed of 200–500 m of black shale and thin-bedded yellow-green sandstone enclosing various olistoliths of sandstone, limestone and chert (Li et al., 2005a, 2005b; Wang et al., 2005)
The age is Maastrichtian to late Paleocene (Liu andAitchison, 2002; Wang et al., 2005)
Most of the Mesozoic zircons display high 176Hf/177Hf isotopic ratios of 0.282826– 0.283072 that yield positive εHf(t) values of +5.0–+13.0 and two-stage Hf model ages of 695–437 MaMost pre-Mesozoic zircons have low 176Hf/ 177Hf isotopic ratios of 0.281101–0.282364 that yield εHf(t) values of −11.7~+8.4 and two-stage Hf model age of 3671–1671 Ma
Most pre-Mesozoic zircons have low 176Hf/ 177Hf isotopic ratios of 0.281101–0.282364 that yield εHf(t) values of −11.7~+8.4 and two-stage Hf model age of 3671–1671 MaSample T07 was collected from the upper part of Zongzhuo Formation, just 5 m below the Rilang conglomerate (Fig
All Mesozoic zircons display high 176Hf/177Hf isotopic ratios of 0.282929–0.283159 that yield positive εHf(t) values of +9.7–+16.7 and two-stage Hf model ages of 756–116 Ma.Sr and Nd isotopic ratios were not age-corrected
In order to discriminate provenances of the upper Cretaceous strata of the northern Tethys Himalaya in Gyangze, southern Tibet, we review the published U–Pb geochronologic zircon data from the Indian craton, the Lesser Himalaya, the Higher Himalaya, the Tethys Himalaya, the Yarlung Zangbo suture zone and the Lhasa terrane (Fig6).
Indian craton detrital zircons are characteristic of ages between Archean and Proterozoic (DeCelles et al., 2004 and references therein)The Lesser Himalayan detrital zircons have age population peaks at 1850 Ma and 2500 Ma (Richards et al., 2005)
The Triassic strata near Zedong and Renbu in southern Tibet show age peaks between 400 Ma and 200 Ma (Amos et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010)Volcanic rocks of the Sangxiu volcanic rocks yield U–Pb age of 133 Ma (Zhu et al., 2007)
Lower Cretaceous Wolong volcaniclastics yield U–Pb age from 140 Ma to 119 Ma, and εHf(t) values from −1.5 to −7.2 (Hu et al., 2010).The Yarlung Zangbo suture zone shows relatively simple age patterns
Detrital zircons from the Jiabula Formation have age population peaks at 500 Ma and 1000 Ma, which is similar to those of Cambrian and younger strata within the Tethys Himalaya and Lhasa terrane(Fig6)
However, the Lhasa terrane source was impossible, because the old grains are not accompanied by abundant Cretaceous zircon grainsScarcely Cretaceous zircon grains were consistent with those found in Nepal which were derived from volcanic provinces in India (DeCelles et al., 2004)
Scarcely Cretaceous zircon grains were consistent with those found in Nepal which were derived from volcanic provinces in India (DeCelles et al., 2004)Thus the source is most likely to be Indian plate.
Detrital zircons from the Zongzhuo Formation show a peak in the range of 169–73 Ma which indicates that they were derived from Jurassic to Cretaceous rocksZircon Hf compositions show that the source rocks are juvenile (Fig
A likely source for the Mesozoic zircons is the Gangdese arcThe whole pattern of detrital zircons from this formation is also similar with that of Xigaze forearc basin strata which were derived from Gangdese arc and northern Lhasa terrane (Wu et al., 2010).
Most of zircons analyzed from the Rilang conglomerate show Mesozoic agesAs shown in Fig
7, the majority of these Mesozoic zircons reveal positive εHf(t) values similar to those from the Zongzhuo FormationThe zircon data lead us to concur with the conclusion that the Gangdese arc may be the main source of detritus within the Rilang conglomerate.

Hf isotopic features of detrital zircons from the upper Cretaceous strata of the Tethys Himalaya in the Gyangze areaThe compositional areas shown in (B) are from Liang et al.,
Combining field observations, together with petrologic, detrital zircon U–Pb–Hf, Cr–spinel composition and bulk rock Nd-isotopic data, the simplest explanation of provenances of the late Cretaceous strata is as follows:Samples from the Jiabula Formation are quartz-rich and lithicpoor, showing signatures of a continental block provenance
The fact that no Cr-spinels from the Yarlung Zangbo suture zone and Cretaceous zircons from the Gangdese arc are present in this formation indicates that the Gangdese arc-trench system did not supply sediments to the Jiabula Formation.Samples from the Zongzhuo Formation are lithic-rich and relatively quartz-poor and show signatures of a recycled orogenic provenance
Besides the N500 Ma zircons derived from the Tethys Himalaya or Lhasa terrane, a sudden influx of Cretaceous-age zircons with positive εHf(t) and intermediate volcanic fragments indicates a source of sediment from a juvenile arcThe Nd isotopic data support the above zircon data and indicated that the Zongzhuo Formation is more isotopically juvenile than that of the Tethys Himalaya
Detrital zircons are almost all Mesozoic in age and show positive εHf(t) valuesCombined with positive εNd(0) and Cr–spinels with arc affinity, detritus of the Rilang conglomerate were mainly derived from a juvenile arc and suture zone
The Gangdese arc consists of Mesozoic and Cenozoic magmatic rocks derived from a juvenile mantle source (Chu et al., 2006; Ji et al., 2009; Mo et al., 2007; Wen et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2008;), which could have supplied detrital materials for the Zongzhuo Formation and the Rilang conglomerate (Fig9A).
During the latest Cretaceous, it has been proposed that the Gangdese arc had already been uplifted to significant elevation and could have shed sediments to basins to both the north and south (DeCelles et al., 2007; Ding and Lai, 2003; Kapp et al., 2005; Kapp et al., 2007; Leier et al., 2007b; Murphy et al., 1997; Wu et al., 2010)Although the fore-arc basin includes Paleocene–Eocene marine strata in the Tso-jiangding area to the west of our study area (Ding et al., 2005), it could have been overfilled in the Xigaze area (Dürr, 1996; Einsele et al., 1994) with sediments shed from the Gangdese arc (Dürr, 1996; Wu et al., 2010), and became a shallow platform setting marking the end of the forearc basin (Wan et al., 1997)
Although the fore-arc basin includes Paleocene–Eocene marine strata in the Tso-jiangding area to the west of our study area (Ding et al., 2005), it could have been overfilled in the Xigaze area (Dürr, 1996; Einsele et al., 1994) with sediments shed from the Gangdese arc (Dürr, 1996; Wu et al., 2010), and became a shallow platform setting marking the end of the forearc basin (Wan et al., 1997)Therefore, detrital sediments could deposit further south to the Indian passive margin across the Xigaze forearc basin which is confirmed by the similarity of detrital zircon patterns between the Zongzhuo Formation and the strata of Xigaze forearc basin (Wu et al., 2010)
Provenance of the upper Cretaceous strata changed during the deposition of Chuangde Formation in Gyangze areaThis similar change is also observed in Saga area (Ding, 2011, unpublished data)
Therefore, the transition from the southern Indian provenance of the Jiabula Formation to the northern Gangdese arc source of the Zongzhuo Formation and Rilang conglomerate indicates that the initial collision between the India and Asia plates occurred during Maastrichtian (~70–65 Ma).The initial collision caused flexure of the downgoing Indian plate, and may be responsible for the drastic sedimentary pattern changes from continental shelf to slope (Willems et al., 1996) and the sharp increase in the rate of tectonic subsidence curve (Rowley, 1998), which were observed near Tingri at about 68 Ma in the southern Tethys HimalayaThe initial collision also caused the deformation of the overriding Lhasa terrane, as recorded by major shortening of the late Cretaceous Takena Formation prior to early Tertiary Linzizong Group volcanism.
The initial collision also caused the deformation of the overriding Lhasa terrane, as recorded by major shortening of the late Cretaceous Takena Formation prior to early Tertiary Linzizong Group volcanism.Paleomagnetism is an effective approach for quantifying paleogeography and constraining plate paleopositions
Paleomagnetic studies show that the southern margin of Lhasa terrane was located at 11.5°N±6.2° during the deposition of the late Cretaceous Takena Formation (Achache et al., 1984)In contrast, the northern margin of the Indian continent was located at ~5°S±5° during 71–65 Ma (Chen et al., 2010; Dupont-Nivet et al., 2010; Patzelt et al., 1996)
Though detailed problems such as the shape and extent of greater India (Ali and Aitchison, 2005), secondary remagnetization (Patzelt et al., 1996), and inclination shallowing (Tan et al., 2010) are still debated, there is an agreement that there was still a huge gap between the Greater Indian continental margin and the Lhasa terraneduringthelatestCretaceous(Chenetal.,2010;Dupont-Nivetetal., 2010; Liebke et al., 2010)Therefore, detrital sediments from the Lhasa terrane were impossible to deposit onto the Indian passive continental margin during late Cretaceous
Therefore, detrital sediments from the Lhasa terrane were impossible to deposit onto the Indian passive continental margin during late CretaceousThis makes the early collision unreasonable
Initial collision between the India plate and Lhasa terrane during Maastrichtian (~70–65 Ma) is challenged by the enormous amount of subsequent intracontinental shortening requiredEarly India–Asia collision predicts at least 2000 km of intercontinental shortening between 70 Ma and 55 Ma based on the relative convergence rate between India and Asia (Copley et al., 2010)
No Paleocene shortening in the Tethys Himalaya and minimal Paleocene shortening in southern Lhasa terrane make this impossible (Ding et al., 2005)However this record could have been totally subducted beneath the Lhasa block along the YZSZ or occurred further to the north within the entire Tibetan plateau (Yin and Harrison, 2000)
Therefore, the first appearance of Cretaceous zircons with positive εHf(t) and intraoceanic arc-related spinels record the obduction of an intra-oceanic subduction system onto the Indian passive continental margin during Maastrichtian (~70–65 Ma) (Fig9C).
The continental Gangdese arc may have transitioned northwestward into the intra-oceanic Kohistan arc in northern Pakistan and northwestern India which was active during Aptian–Cenomanian (Rolland et al., 2002), and collided with the Karakorum block at 85– 80 Ma (Searle et al., 1999)In Zedong to the east of our study area, geochemical studies indentify a suite of intra-oceanic arc volcanic rocks (Aitchison et al., 2007b)
The scarcity of Cretaceous arc fragments in southern Tibet may be explained by complete northward underthrusting beneath the southern Asian margin (Makovsky et al., 1999).However, considering no accepted intro-oceanic arc was found and the possibility that the very southern edge of the Gangdese arc was built on oceanic crust and thus it also exhibits characteristics of an oceanic arc, we tentatively prefer option (1)
Future studies of precise chronostratigraphy of the late Cretaceous strata in northern Tethys Himalaya and post-collision shortening through the Tibetan plateau and high quality Paleomagnetic data have potential to reveal the initial process of the India–Asia collision.In-situ U–Pb–Hf isotopic from detrital zircons, bulk rock Nd isotopic and Cr–spinel analysis and petrographic data from the upper Cretaceous clastic sedimentary rocks of the northern Tethys Himalaya near Gyangze, southern Tibet have lead to the following major conclusions:
In-situ U–Pb–Hf isotopic from detrital zircons, bulk rock Nd isotopic and Cr–spinel analysis and petrographic data from the upper Cretaceous clastic sedimentary rocks of the northern Tethys Himalaya near Gyangze, southern Tibet have lead to the following major conclusions:The Jiabula Formation was derived from the Indian continent.
The Zongzhuo Formation and Rilang conglomerate contain abundantCretaceous zircon grains with positive εHf(t) and arc-related Cr–spinelsindicating a juvenile arc source
The sudden appearanceof Cretaceouszirconswith positiveεHf(t) and arc-related Cr–spinels can be interpreted as initial collision between the Indian and Asian plates during Maastrichtian (70–65 Ma).Supplementary materials related to this article can be found online at doi:10.1016/j.epsl.2011.02.055.
