The basin is associated with Early Cretaceous–Neogene orogenesis of the southern Patagonian Andes (Dalziel et al., 1974; Natland et al., 1974; Wilson, 1991; Fildani and Hessler, 2005; Fosdick et al., 2011)The development of the basin was linked to a dynamic Mesozoic tectonic history in southernmost South America, including: (1) a Jurassic–Early Cretaceous extensional phase associated with the initial breakup of Gondwana, which resulted in the formation of the Rocas Verdes backarc basin (Pankhurst et al., 2000; Fildani and Hessler, 2005); and (2) a Late Cretaceous–Neogene compressional phase, which led to the development of a pronounced foredeep eastward of the Andean front (Fildani et al., 2003; Fildani and Hessler, 2005; Fosdick et al., 2011; Malkowski et al., 2017).
