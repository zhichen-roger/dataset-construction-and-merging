The Cretaceous–early Tertiary Gangdese arc in southern Tibet is generally attributed to the northward subduction of Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere prior to Indo-Asian collisionHowever, the history and tectonic significance of deformation and sedimentation in Tibet during this time interval have remained enigmatic
During the Late Cretaceous to Eocene, the convergence rate between the Indian and Asian plates exceeded 10 cm/yr (e.g., Patriat and Achache, 1984; Klootwijk et al., 1992; Lee and Lawver, 1995)This convergence was coeval with northward subduction of Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere beneath southern Asia and the development of the Gangdese continental magmatic arc in southern Tibet (e.g., Schärer et al., 1984)
An angular unconformity in the Lhasa terrane between strongly shortened Cretaceous and older strata and overlying, weakly deformed uppermost Cretaceous to lower Tertiary volcanicbearing strata of the Linzizong Formation (Fig1) has led to speculation that there is a contractional (Cordilleran-style) orogen related to the Gangdese arc (e.g., Burg et al., 1983; England and Searle, 1986; Ratschbacher et al., 1992)
We document a retroarc thrust belt and foreland basin associated with the Cretaceous–early Tertiary Cordilleran-style southern margin of AsiaOur results and interpretations provide an integrated picture of the Gangdese continental margin tectonic system and shed light on the nature of the Tibetan lithosphere prior to the Indo-Asian collision.
The Takena Formation consists of an ~250-m-thick lower unit of Aptian-Albian marine carbonate parasequences that is conformably overlain by an ~100-m-thick zone of stacked paleosol horizons and >2 km of upward coarsening fluvial redbeds (Fig2; Leier et al., 2007)
It is subvertical and juxtaposes Paleozoic to Cretaceous (?) metasedimentary rocks to the south against lower-grade Triassic strata in the north (Kidd et al., 1988)The fault predates Indo-Asian collision; it is intruded by Paleocene-Eocene granites and unconformably overlain by ca

47 Ma in its footwall (He et al., 2007), whereas the structurally highest thrust with Paleozoic strata in the hanging wall is intruded by a suite of granites that has been dated to 57– 50 Ma along strike to the west (Fig2)
Cretaceous and older strata were strongly folded prior to Linzizong volcanismWhereas many of the folds are upright (Burg et al., 1983; Ratschbacher et al., 1992; Pan, 1993), hundreds-of-meter-wavelength overturned folds near Penbo show northward vergence (Fig
2) exposes metasedimentary rocks of previously inferred Paleozoic age (Kidd et al., 1988; Liu, 1988), although recent studies suggest that some of these rocks may be as young as Cretaceous (Edwards and Ratschbacher, 2005; Kapp et al., 2005a)Our mapping shows that metasedimentary rocks within the core of the range are regionally S-dipping and include Aptian-Albian metalimestone and >2 km of overlying metaclastic rocks
Our mapping shows that metasedimentary rocks within the core of the range are regionally S-dipping and include Aptian-Albian metalimestone and >2 km of overlying metaclastic rocksA U-Pb detrital zircon age spectrum for a metasandstone collected ~1.8 km tectonostratigraphically above the metalimestone (630041; Fig
2) shows prominent Early Cretaceous and early Tertiary peaks (Fig4A)
We interpret the Cretaceous-Tertiary zircons to have been derived from the Gangdese arc to the south and the peak age of the youngest zircon population (ca54 Ma) to provide a maximum depositional age
Within the late Cenozoic Damxung-Jiali shear zone to the south (Fig2; Edwards and Ratschbacher, 2005), the metaclastic rocks are exposed structurally beneath S-dipping Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks

Along the northern flank of the Nyainqentanglha Range, conglomeratic redbeds of previously inferred Cretaceous age are locally exposed in the footwall of a S-dipping thrust to the south and a N-dipping thrust to the north (Fig2)

The largest displacement “Lhasa-Damxung thrust” carries Paleozoic strata in the hanging wallThis thrust (1) roots into the subsurface south of Lhasa, (2) was passively folded into an antiform between Lhasa and Penbo, (3) structurally overlies horses of Mesozoic strata north of Penbo, (4) has tectonic windows that expose footwall Cretaceous–lower Tertiary (?) redbeds between Penbo and Damxung, and (5) resurfaces in the Nyainqentanglha Range (Fig

The youngest and most northward feature of the thrust belt is the lower Eocene triangle zone along the northern flank of the Nyainqentanglha Range (Fig3).
At least 160 km of shortening is required to (1) account for the N-S length of Paleozoic strata carried in the hanging wall of the Lhasa-Damxung thrust, and (2) emplace underlying horses of Mesozoic strata (Fig5A)
This slip, together with slip along a structurally lower décollement beneath Triassic strata, fed northward to thrusts that surfaced in the Nyainqentanglha Range.A hinterland ramp anticline provides a simple explanation for the regional northward dip of Triassic–lower Tertiary strata in the Penbo region (Fig

1), Paleozoic strata are exposed in the hanging wall of a S-dipping thrust to the north and a N-dipping thrust to the south, both of which were active during the Cretaceous (Murphy et al., 1997)The Paleozoic strata were interpreted to core a pop-up structure between thrusts of opposing vergence

near-modern elevations by the late Eocene (Rowley and Currie, 2006) and certainly no later than the late Oligocene (DeCelles et al., 2007)How much elevation was produced in this and other regions of Tibet by contractional tectonism prior to the Indo-Asian collision remains to be quantified
