A detailed study using back-scattered electron imaging and electron-microprobe analysis shows that grains of detrital monazite are present in the Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic and Jurassic sediments of the Tim Mersoï basin, NigerDespite variations in the size and shape of monazite grains, the U–Th–Pb chemical ages obtained by electron microprobe fall in a narrow range, 425 to 650 Ma
It contains medium- to fine-grained siliciclastic sedimentary rocks of Devonian to Cretaceous ageThe sedimentary sequence has a total thickness of about 1200 m and hosts several world-class deposits of uranium
They are located in the Visean Guezouman Formation for the deposits mined underground by Cominak near Arlit (44 000 tonnes U), and in the Namurian Tarat Formation, mined by open pit by Somaïr near Akokan (50 000 tonnes U), 50 km to the west of the Aïr basementThe grade ranges from 0.2 to 0.5 percent
1B) consist of Cambrian and Proterozoic gneisses and granites, Devonian plutonic rocks and annular volcanic complexes (Moreau et al1994), like the Goundaï rhyolitic massif (Fig
During the Carboniferous, the direction of sediment transport indicates erosion of the Hoggar and Aïr MountainsDuring the Permian to Cretaceous, sediments were transported from south to north and northwest
During the Permian to Cretaceous, sediments were transported from south to north and northwestDuring this stage, detrital material was derived from the Aïr and Zinder areas of Niger and from Nigeria
From the Visean to the Upper Jurassic, four groups can be distinguished (Fig2): (1) the Terada Group (Lower Visean to Upper Visean) includes mudstones, sandstones, and siltstones, (2) the Tagora Group (higher Visean to Namurian–Westphalian) contains continental sandstones, marine sandstones, arkoses and mudstones, (3) the Izegouandan Group (Permian) consists of arkoses, mudstones and analcimolite, and (4) the Agadès Group (Triassic – Jurassic – Lower Cretaceous) consists of sandstones, arkoses and important amounts of volcanic material.

Only the Imouraren U deposit was discovered in the younger (Triassic – Jurassic) Aguelal, Goufat, and Wagadi groups (Fig2)
In the Carboniferous beds located west of the Arlit fault (AOKA 6 drill-hole, Fig1), the monazite grains are rounded and chemically
In the Carboniferous beds east of the Arlit fault, monazite grains are rareIn the post-Carboniferous formations (Moradi, Teloua 3, Mousseden and Abinky), monazite grains are generally less abundant
In the post-Carboniferous formations (Moradi, Teloua 3, Mousseden and Abinky), monazite grains are generally less abundantThey occur as chemically homogeneous and euhedral grains <20 mm across in the matrix or as inclusions in analcime
In the Carboniferous formations, the grains show a larger spread in age than in the post-Carboniferous formations (Fig7)
We find it surprising that there is only one grain of monazite from older basement units (>650 Ma), as the Aïr basement contains much older Proterozoic units (Liégeois et al1994, Navez et al
In the Carboniferous formations, the contribution of these grains is very large: 34 percent in the Tarat Formation, and 63 percent in the Akokan Unit Formation.In these formations, the content of soluble uranium is less than 10 percent
In the post-Carboniferous formations (Abinky, Mousseden, Teloua 3 and Moradi), the amount of soluble uranium is greater, and ranges from 18.3 to 35.2 percent, but the contribution of the monazite to the bulk-rock U content may be as low as 4.9 percent (Table 6)The amount of U held in monazite in each rock sample is variable
Although it was not possible to obtain an age for the monazite from the Goundaï rhyolite (Pb is near or below detection limit), the volcanic rocks are Devonian in age (Moreau et al1994)
Considering the composition and ages of monazite, Pan-African granites and metamorphic rocks rather than the anorogenic Devonian volcanic rocks are assumed to be the main source for the monazite in the Tim Mersoï basinAccording to the paleodirections obtained by Valsardieu (1971), these detrital products could be issued from the Aïr Mountains during the Carboniferous and from the Zinder and Nigeria basements during the Permian – Triassic – Jurassic
According to the paleodirections obtained by Valsardieu (1971), these detrital products could be issued from the Aïr Mountains during the Carboniferous and from the Zinder and Nigeria basements during the Permian – Triassic – JurassicThe Aïr Mountains do host rocks with ages in the 400–420 Ma range (Table 1), ages not known in Nigeria and in the Zinder Mountains
This explains why the age range of monazite is more restricted in the post-Carboniferous sandstones than in the Carboniferous formationsForbes et al
In the Aïr Mountains, the Devonian Goundaï and Bilete complexes represent the type of volcanic material that could have been erodedThese complexes are rich in U and Zr (Bowden et al
