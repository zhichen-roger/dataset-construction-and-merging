To this end, we consider detrital zircon ages from the Paleozoic (Gehrels et al., 2011) and Mesozoic (Dickinson and Gehrels, 2009, 2008) succession across the Colorado Plateau, the subject of MDS mapping later in the paper (Table DR1)These data are represented by 6173 zircon ages determined by laser ablation–multicollector–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry among 65 samples (average grains per sample n = 95) extending from the Cambrian Tapeats Sandstone at the base section through the Jurassic Morrison Formation at the top
These data are represented by 6173 zircon ages determined by laser ablation–multicollector–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry among 65 samples (average grains per sample n = 95) extending from the Cambrian Tapeats Sandstone at the base section through the Jurassic Morrison Formation at the topFor each sample, we first calculated their PDP and fixed bandwidth KDE (e.g., Botev, 2007)
Points are measures of difference between each of 2080 possible pairs of 65 samples from the Paleozoic (Gehrels et al., 2011) and Mesozoic (Dickinson and Gehrels, 2009, 2008) succession extending across the Colorado PlateauNote that for each of these three metrics, similarity/dissimilarity values are virtually identical for PDP and KDE representations of sample ages
Remarkable exposures of Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata across the Colorado Plateau offer a nearly unparalleled opportunity to examine changes in detrital zircon provenance of Cambrian through Jurassic sandstones across of the southwestern United StatesRecent LA-ICP-MS determinations of 2529 zircon U-Pb grain ages from 26 Paleozoic samples (Gehrels et al., 2011) and 3444-grain ages from 36 Triassic and Jurassic samples (Dickinson and Gehrels, 2008, 2009) afford an excellent opportunity to compare more traditional representations of grain ages (Fig

These are an early Jurassic Moenave sample that contains numerous late Paleozoic grains (“1” and blue arrow in A and B), and two Late Cretaceous samples that are dominated by ca1.7 Ga Yavapai-Mazatzal ages (“2” and red arrows in A and B)
Mississippian through Permian rocks contain predominantly 1.1 Ga and younger Paleozoic grains derived from the Grenville and Appalachian orogen, respectivelyMesozoic sands record a greater number of age components but exhibit little directional upsection stratigraphic/secular variation (Dickinson and Gehrels, 2008, 2009).
Mesozoic sands record a greater number of age components but exhibit little directional upsection stratigraphic/secular variation (Dickinson and Gehrels, 2008, 2009).With multiple age components throughout the data set that vary in their presence and proportions upsection, as well as the relatively large number of samples, a 3-D MDS plot affords an opportunity to view clear changes in provenance within the stratigraphic sequence in a single plot
8B) are almost exactly the same as the groupings of Cambrian through Devonian, Mississippian through Permian, and Mesozoic that are apparent in the PDP heat map (Fig8A; Gehrels et al
Among these are an early Jurassic (Moenave Formation, Utah) sample which contains an anomalously high concentration (40 of 93 grains, 43 percent) spanning only 40 Ma of the late Paleozoic (202–242 Ma; labeled 1 in Fig8B), and two Late Cretaceous samples (northeastern New Mexico and southwestern Utah) that are dominated by ca

(2013) compiled and qualitatively interpreted zircon age data from Phanerozoic units exposed in the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming to better understand the tectonostratigraphic evolution of that regionBased on 4104 U-Pb detrital zircon ages from 44 samples, May et al
subdivided Upper Mississippian through Paleocene units into four “tectonostratigraphic assemblages” based on perceived patterns in sample zircon age frequency distributions: (1) a Paleozoic–Triassic proximal continental margin assemblage; (2) a Jurassic–early Cretaceous (early Albian) assemblage associated with organization of Cordilleran orogeny; (3) a late Cretaceous (late Albian through Maastrichtian) interior seaway foreland basin assemblage; and (4) a Paleogene assemblage accumulated during structural segmentation during the Laramide orogeny (Fig9A)
However, the posited fourth assemblage, comprising three Paleogene samples, does not separate as a distinct group or clusterEach of the resolved assemblages contains either a unique component or component with anomalously high proportions
In addition, MDS mapping reveals that the population differences differentiating the first (Paleozoic) and second (lower Mesozoic) assemblages are smaller than those distinguishing the second from the third assemblage (upper Cretaceous)Qualitative differences among sample PDPs support this conclusion; abundant Grenvillian (ca
1.1 Ga) grains persist upsection through Paleozoic and lower Mesozoic units but are largely absent above the early Albian Greybull Sandstone at the top of association (sample 22, Fig9A).

Here, we conclude by examining age data from samples of the Paleocene Wilcox Formation collected along ~2000 km of outcrop belt, extending northwest from western Alabama to the head of the Mississippi embayment south of StLouis, Missouri, and then southwest toward San Antonio, Texas (Blum and Pecha, 2014).
Cenozoic-scale persistence of several major fluvial axes supplying sediment to the northwestern Gulf of Mexico coastal plain (e.g., Galloway et al., 2011) served to impart prominent along-strike variation in the dominance of the same major age components observed comprising grains in the Colorado Plateau and Bighorn Basin (Fig10A)

Three of the four assemblages are well-resolved by MDS: (1) Upper Mississippian–Triassic samples (blue bar in A and points in B), (2) Jurassic–lower Albian samples (green bar in A and points in B), and (3) upper Albian–Cretaceous samples (yellow bar in A and points in B)A posited fourth assemblage comprising three Paleogene samples (red bar in A and points in B) does not well segregate as a distinct population
