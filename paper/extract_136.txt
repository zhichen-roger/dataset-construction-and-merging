Cretaceous platforms contain important information about changes in fauna, depositional facies, diagenesis, and climatic events, and they provide clues to platform growth and demiseComparison of different carbonate platforms from diverse tectonic and climatic settings provides a unique test to constrain basic controls on carbonate platform evolution, including effects of biotic changes, eustatic sea level fluctuations, variations in tectonic subsidence rates, terrigenous sediment influx, paleoclimates, and long- and short-term accretion and demise of carbonate platforms

If volumes of sediment are considered (see Schlager, 1981; Simo, 1989b), the Pyrenean platforms would have had to double their sediment production (Figure 7) to keep up with Late Cretaceous relative sea level riseThis may have surpassed the maximum threshold for carbonate production

Three examples help to illustrate how episodic sedimentation reduced accumulation rates: (1) during sequence boundary formation, sedimentation was interrupted and the platform was exposed to subaerial erosion; (2) during the Turonian, shallow water carbonate production was reduced and sedimentation on the platform was mostly in deeper water; and (3) depositional cycles are bounded by flooding surfaces that indicate times of starved sedimentation on the platformThese examples indicate that there is a significant amount of geologic time in nondepositional surfaces and that carbonate production, once inter.rupted, has a "lag" time before beginning to produce sediment

Dredged samples from the summit transparent layer suggest that it consists of Cretaceous reefal carbonatesSince the Upper Limestone Formation is exposed in the upper part of the edifice and the summit at depths ranging from 4500 to 3600 m, its maximum thickness is estimated to be about 900 m.
