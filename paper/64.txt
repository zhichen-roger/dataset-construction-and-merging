Presently located on northernmost Ellesmere Island (Fig1), it is potentially exotic to Laurentia, having possibly accreted to the Franklinian margin
during the Silurian, and it has Caledonian and possibly Grenvillian affi nity (Churkin and Trexler, 1980; Trettin, 1987)Geochronological data from the Pearya terrane are sparse, and it is not clear what detrital zircon ages it might supply as a source region or how it may contribute to paleocontinental reconstructions.
Crystalline basement of the Pearya terrane includes Mesoproterozoic granitoids and gneisses of approximately Grenvillian and slightly younger age (Trettin, 1987; Trettin et al., 1987)That basement is overlain by Neo proterozoic metasedimentary rocks and an Ordovician– Silurian arc-related sedimentary and volcanic succession
That basement is overlain by Neo proterozoic metasedimentary rocks and an Ordovician– Silurian arc-related sedimentary and volcanic successionThe Franklinian shelf is a late Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic passive-margin succession on northwest Laurentia (Trettin, 1991)
The Franklinian shelf is a late Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic passive-margin succession on northwest Laurentia (Trettin, 1991)Early stratigraphic interpretations tied Neoproterozoic and lower Paleozoic stratigraphy of the Pearya terrane across a narrow basin called the Hazen Trough to the Franklinian shelf and thus considered the Pearya terrane as an “in situ ensialic magmatic arc” with Laurentian affi nity (Trettin, 1973)
Early stratigraphic interpretations tied Neoproterozoic and lower Paleozoic stratigraphy of the Pearya terrane across a narrow basin called the Hazen Trough to the Franklinian shelf and thus considered the Pearya terrane as an “in situ ensialic magmatic arc” with Laurentian affi nity (Trettin, 1973)Subsequent interpretations have led to the prevailing view that it is at least in part allochthonous, with accretion related to the Caledonian orogeny (Churkin and Trexler, 1980; Trettin, 1987)
Silurian fl ysch deposits of the Danish River Formation are distributed across the Pearya terrane and Franklinian shelf rocks of Ellesmere Island and Greenland, and they are considered to be an overlap assemblage following fi nal emplacement of the Pearya terrane (Trettin , 1998).Provenance studies of Devonian strata from northern Laurentia have interpreted 700–550 Ma detrital zircons to have been derived from nonLaurentian source regions made available during Caledonian and Ellesmerian collisional tectonics (Beranek et al., 2010; Lemieux et al., 2011; Anfi nson et al., 2012a, 2012b)
Provenance studies of Devonian strata from northern Laurentia have interpreted 700–550 Ma detrital zircons to have been derived from nonLaurentian source regions made available during Caledonian and Ellesmerian collisional tectonics (Beranek et al., 2010; Lemieux et al., 2011; Anfi nson et al., 2012a, 2012b)The suspect affi nity of the Pearya terrane has led to speculation that it was a potential source of 700–550 Ma detrital zircons within strata of the Devonian Clastic Wedge (Beranek et al., 2010; Lemieux et al., 2011; Anfi nson et al.,

Neoproterozoic strata of the Franklinian Basin are rarely exposed and not well constrained (Trettin, 1991; Harrison, 1995); however, Cambrian facies of the Canadian Arctic Islands and Greenland defi ne a Franklinian shelf and an associated “deep water basin” to the northwest, previously referred to as the Hazen Trough (Trettin et al., 1991; Higgins et al., 1991).Along eastern Laurentia, deformed rocks within the East Greenland Caledonides include a lower Paleozoic passive-margin succession (Higgins, 1995)

Rocks of the Northwestern terrane of Svalbard include Mesoproterozoic sedimentary protoliths that were migmatized and intruded by Tonian granitoids (Pettersson et al., 2009)The age of the Sveco-Norwegian orogen in Baltica is 1.06–0.91 Ga (e.g., Bingen and Solli, 2009)

Following Neoproterozoic breakout from Rodinia, the Laurentian craton was bounded by passive margins that were fully established by Cambrian timeThe Franklinian Basin of the Canadian Arctic Islands and northern Greenland developed along the northern margin of Laurentia (Fig
Shelf-margin blocks had foundered in the Early Silurian (Llandoverian) to be overlain by siliciclastic turbidites of the Peary Land Group, interpreted as fl ysch (Surlyk and Hurst, 1984), which are correlated to the Danish River Formation of Ellesmere Island (Trettin, 1998)The submarine fan system of north Greenland is thought to have prograded westward, parallel to the Franklinian margin (Surlyk and Hurst, 1984).
Ordovician stratigraphy of the Franklinian shelf is adapted from Dewing and Knowlan (2004), and Neoproterozoic stratigraphy is adapted from Dewing et al(2008)
The Devonian clastic wedge records deposition of extensive siliciclastic sediment in a foreland basin (Embry and Klovan, 1976; Embry, 1991)The origin of the foreland basin has been attributed to mid-Devonian collisional events that culminated in the Late Devonian–Mississippian Ellesmerian orogeny (Anfi nson et al., 2012a, 2012b).
The origin of the foreland basin has been attributed to mid-Devonian collisional events that culminated in the Late Devonian–Mississippian Ellesmerian orogeny (Anfi nson et al., 2012a, 2012b).The oldest exposed rocks of the Franklinian deep water basin are tholeiitic basalts of the Yelvert on Formation (Fig
3); they have uncertain ages but are thought to be Cambrian or older because they are thrust over Cambrian strata (Trettin, 1998)Similar mafi c volcanic rocks of the Jaeger Lake Formation are found in the Heiberg fold belt of northern Axel Heiberg Island (Fig
The deep-water succession passes from Cambrian sandstones of the Grantland Formation through Cambrian–Silurian Hazen Formation mudstone to Silurian fl ysch of the Danish River Formation (Trettin, 1998).Island, near Fire Bay (Fig
2), the LlanvirnCaradoc (Middle Ordovician) interval of theHazen Formation (Norford; see Appendix in Trettin, 1998) contains carbonate olistoliths from a few meters up to 250 m in size, with Arenig-Llanvirn fossils (Nowlan; Appendix in Trettin, 1998)
Fossils are middle to late Llandovery (Norford; Appendix in Trettin, 1998)The abundance of volcanic rocks and grain size both increase to the northwest, suggesting that the Pearya terrane was a source for the Fire Bay Formation (Trettin, 1998)
Turbidites of the Danish River Formation are of Llandovery to Ludlow age in the Deep Water Basin and also contain limestone olistoliths near the Pearya terrane (Trettin, 1998)A felsic dike from northern Axel Heiberg Island yielded a U-Pb zircon age of 368 ± 3 Ma (Trettin et al., 1992).
Granitic and gneissic rocks of Mesoproterozoic–Tonian age are the oldest known rocks of the Pearya terrane and represent crystalline basement (Trettin, 1998)One sample of Deuchars Glacier granitoid is best summarized by an upper intercept age of 1037 +25/–20 Ma (sample 80-TM-213C), and another yielded three fractions at ca
Neoproterozoic to Ordovician informal stratigraphy (Succession 2 of Trettin, 1998), is subdivided into three intervals (Fig3)
The third interval (map unit M) is an association of Cambrian quartzite, marble, phyllite, and alkaline basalt overlain by Ordovician (see time scale Fig3) phyllite and tuff that has yielded a U-Pb zircon age of 503.2 +7.8/–1.7 Ma (Trettin et al., 1987).
Metamorphosed Lower Ordovician volc anic and sedimentary rocks of the Maskell Inlet complex are exposed in the northwestern Pearya terrane near M’Clintock Inlet (Succession 3 of Trettin, 1998; Fig3 herein)
Two main Paleozoic deformation events that affected the Pearya terrane were the Lower– Middle Ordovician M’Clintock orogeny (Trettin, 1987), and the Late Devonian–Mississippian Ellesmerian orogeny (e.g., Trettin et al., 1991)The M’Clintock orogeny is bracketed in time by a deformed ca
Ordovician granitoids related to the M’Clintock orogeny include the Ayles Fiord granodiorite dated at 475 ± 1 Ma (Trettin et al., 1992), which is thought to be syntectonic (Trettin, 1998), and the Cape Richards intrusive complex granodiorite dated at 463 ± 5 Ma (Trettin et al., 1987), thought to be post-tectonicSchist at the head of M’Clintock Inlet yielded an Ar-Ar biotite cooling age of ca
Overlying Lower–Middle Ordovician volcanic rocks, and postdating both Middle Ordovician intrusions and the M’Clintock orogeny, there is a mainly sedimentary succession of Upper Ordovician terrestrial to shallow-marine siliciclastics and carbonates (Fig3)
Siliciclastic turbidites of the Cranstone and Danish River Formations are interpreted as fl ysch that was deposited in a Silurian foreland basin (Trettin, 1998).An unnamed Early Devonian deformation event affected Silurian rocks of northern Axel Heiberg Island, but it has not been identifi ed on Ellesmere Island (Trettin, 1998)
An unnamed Early Devonian deformation event affected Silurian rocks of northern Axel Heiberg Island, but it has not been identifi ed on Ellesmere Island (Trettin, 1998)The Cape Woods pluton (monzonite to granodiorite) of Pearya terrane, dated at 390 ± 10 Ma (U-Pb titanite; Trettin et al., 1987), is thought to be associated with this event (Trettin, 1998).
In a strict sense, the Ellesmerian orogeny is Late Devonian–MississippianAll Silurian and older rocks of the Pearya terrane were folded during this event, and it was probably the fi rst time that the post–M’Clintock orogeny, Cape Discovery Formation and younger strata were folded (Trettin, 1998)
All Silurian and older rocks of the Pearya terrane were folded during this event, and it was probably the fi rst time that the post–M’Clintock orogeny, Cape Discovery Formation and younger strata were folded (Trettin, 1998)A small porphyry intruded the northern Pearya terrane at 368 ±3 Ma (Trettin et al., 1992), which overlaps in age with both the youngest strata and detrital zircon within the Devonian clastic wedge (Anfi nson et al., 2012b).

Age spectra of detrital zircons derived from Precambrian rocks of Laurentia are dominated by Neoarchean and two Proterozoic ranges that broadly correlate with orogenic events leading to establishment of the supercontinents Nuna at 2.0–1.8 Ga and Rodinia at 1.2–1.0 Ga (Hadlari et al., 2012)Hadlari et al
(2012) identifi ed two general detrital zircon spectra for Cambrian rocks termed “Cambrian of Laurentia type I and type II” (Fig4)
The relative proportion of the two Cambrian reference types is geographically controlled, and the retained spectral coherence and distinctness in Cambrian rocks are attributed to local sediment provenance of Cambrian depositional systems throughout LaurentiaThe Laurentian reference spectra (Hadlari et al., 2012) do not include detrital zircon ages from Neoproterozoic strata of East Greenland, which do qualify as Laurentian affi nity, and which have yielded Mesoproterozoic–Tonian ages
The Laurentian reference spectra (Hadlari et al., 2012) do not include detrital zircon ages from Neoproterozoic strata of East Greenland, which do qualify as Laurentian affi nity, and which have yielded Mesoproterozoic–Tonian ages(Fig
Detrital zircon samples from the Neoproterozoic Morænesø Formation of northern Greenland have also yielded Mesoproterozoic and a few Tonian ages (Kirkland et al., 2009).Detrital zircon ages from Neoproterozoic to Devonian strata of the Franklinian shelf (Fig

Proterozoic and Cambrian sandstones are dominated by 1.8 Ga and Archean ages typical of the type I Cambrian of Laurentia reference spectra and are attributed to sources in the Precambrian Shield in northern Canada and GreenlandIn contrast to the 1.8 Ga dominance on the Franklinian Shelf, Cambrian sandstones from the deep water basin of Ellesmere Island contain Mesoproterozoic and rare Tonian detrital zircons (Beranek et al., 2013)
In contrast to the 1.8 Ga dominance on the Franklinian Shelf, Cambrian sandstones from the deep water basin of Ellesmere Island contain Mesoproterozoic and rare Tonian detrital zircons (Beranek et al., 2013)A single sample of the Danish River Formation yielded a broader spectrum of 2150–900 Ma, and it is interpreted to have been transported through the deep water basin from the East Greenland Caledonides (Anfi nson et al., 2012a)
The Devonian clastic wedge has similar detrital zircon ages and also a signifi cant fraction of 700–550 Ma grains, which Anfi nson et al(2012a) suggested was a fi ngerprint for a hypothetical landmass, Crockerl and, that collided northwest of the Canadian Arctic Islands during the Ellesmerian orogeny
The 700–550 Ma detrital zircon ages are important because they occur within Devonian clastic wedge strata from the Canadian Arctic Islands (Anfi nson et al., 2012a) and also Devonian turbidites (Hadlari et al., 2009) of the Mackenzie Mountains (Fig4; Beranek et al., 2010; Lemieux et al., 2011)

Approximately 10 percent of the analyses have Paleoproterozoic and Archean ages of 1997–1754, 2231, 2774, 2788, and 2949 Ma.The Cape Discovery Formation overlies older rock units with angular unconformity and provides a minimum age for the M’Clintock orogeny (Trettin, 1998)

Hudsonian-aged and Archean zircons are of very low probability.Due to the similar age, depositional environment, and detrital zircon provenance of Cranstone and Danish River Formations, we include detrital zircon ages from Cranstone and Danish River Formations in the same age probability plot (Fig
The highest age probability peak of the oldest sample, P-Np1 (map unit A), has a Tonian range of ca997–923 Ma, which overlaps with ca
1511–1318 Ma, which dominate the probability of Tonian ages in the overall sampleWith 80 and 60 analyses each, it is possible that low-frequency fractions of 8 percent or less were not detected, and so the data only permit characterization of the main detrital zircon fractions
Two main detrital zircon associations are apparent in Neoproterozoic strata of the Pearya terrane (Fig5): The fi rst has ca

Upper Ordovician sandstones are consistent in detrital zircon character (P-O2 to P-O6), suggesting that Ordovician magmatism in the source regions had declined by ca450 Ma, and the youngest zircon is 438 ± 9 Ma (2σ)
The most prominent age probability peak for Upper Ordovician sandstones is Tonian, which is consistent with uplift and erosion of sources local to the Pearya terrane such as map unit A (Trettin, 1998) and granitoids such as ca965 Ma Cape Phillips pluton (Trettin et al., 1992).
The Cranstone and Danish River Formation sandstones (P-S1, P-S2) that are part of the Silurian fl ysch assemblage have age probability peaks with ranges of ca471–440 Ma and ca
980–908 Ma, which are very similar to Ordovician sandstones of the Pearya terrane and are consistent with Ordovician igneous and Tonian basement agesCirca 663–628 Ma zircons in Silurian fl ysch overlap with similar ages of ca
Circa 663–628 Ma zircons in Silurian fl ysch overlap with similar ages of ca646–622 Ma in the Cape Discovery Formation.
Key age intervals from the Pearya terrane detrital zircon analyses are: inferred local Tonian 1000–910 Ma sources; other 1200– 1000, 1550–1300 Ma, and 1700–1600 Ma sources available during Neoproterozoic time; Ordovician ages of 490–450 Ma; and the enigmatic 670–620 Ma intervalThere is virtually no change in the range of ages within detrital zircon spectra from Pearya terrane rocks from the Cape Discovery Formation to the Danish River Formation, except that the Cape Discovery to Lorimer Ridge Formations contain ages that are very nearly syndepositional.
The Cambrian Rawlings Bay Formation sample has identical detrital zircon age spectra as the Neoproterozoic Kennedy Channel (F-Np2) and the Cambrian Archer Fiord (AF in Anfi nson et al., 2012) samples, all from Judge Daly PromontoryThat 2000–1800 Ma and Archean-dominant spectra represent local provenance that defi nes the northern margin of the Franklinian shelf
That 2000–1800 Ma and Archean-dominant spectra represent local provenance that defi nes the northern margin of the Franklinian shelfComparison to sample F-Np1 would suggest that there was strong geographic control on Cambrian provenance, consistent with other regions of northern Laurentia (Hadlari et al., 2012).
Comparison to sample F-Np1 would suggest that there was strong geographic control on Cambrian provenance, consistent with other regions of northern Laurentia (Hadlari et al., 2012).The Danish River sample F-S1 contains detrital zircon ages that match the three recurrent fractions of Precambrian ages: 1200–1000 Ma, 2000–1800 Ma, and Archean
The Danish River sample F-S1 contains detrital zircon ages that match the three recurrent fractions of Precambrian ages: 1200–1000 Ma, 2000–1800 Ma, and ArcheanThe age spectrum is inconsistent with provenance from the local Franklinian shelf and is interpreted to be indicative of a more distal source region.
Cambrian sandstone, mudstone, and conglomerate of the Grantland Formation are interpreted as turbidites (Trettin, 1994)These are overlain by the mudstone-dominant Hazen Formation (Trettin, 1994)

Within Clements-Markham fold belt, the Danish River Formation sandstone and conglomerate are turbidites of Early Silurian age (Llandovery; Norford in Trettin, 1994)Samples DW-S1 and DW-S2 were collected from gray fi ne-grained sandstones located near Phillips Inlet and Yelverton Inlet, respectively (Fig
The Danish River Formation sandstones (DW-S1, n = 81; DW-S2, n = 76) in the Deep Water Basin contain a relatively minor, but signifi cant, Ordovician peak at ca491–448 Ma; Cambrian ages of ca
491–448 Ma; Cambrian ages of ca524 Ma, 533 Ma, and
557 Ma; and late Cryogenian peak ca671–629 Ma
The age spectra are very similar to Silurian fl ysch of the Pearya terrane in terms of Mesoproterozoic zircon, including a Tonian peak at ca998–934 Ma.
Upper Devonian fl uvial sandstone, mudstone, and conglomerate of the Okse Bay Formation overlie marine facies of the deep water basin (Embry, 1991)The Okse Bay Formation is correlative to Beverley Inlet and Fram formations elsewhere in the Franklinian Basin.

The Lower Cambrian Grantland Formation samples contain Mesoproterozoic and Tonian detrital zircon assemblages (Fig7) also reported by Beranek et al
(2013), that overlap in age with those within Neoproterozoic strata of the Pearya terrane, particularly the younger sample P-Np2 (Fig5)
The dominant 2000–1800 Ma and Archean peaks, however, match Neop roteroz oic and Cambrian strata of the northern Franklinian shelf marginTo further illustrate that dual relationship, detrital zircon spectra are plotted in a geographic, approximately south to north transect from the Franklinian shelf through the deep water basin to the Pearya terrane (Fig
The most commonly cited tectonic model for the Pearya terrane invokes Silurian accretion of a terrane exotic to Laurentia (Trettin, 1987, 1991, 1998; Colpron and Nelson, 2009; von Gosen et al., 2012; McClelland et al., 2012)In that model, crystalline basement of Grenville or Sveco-Norwegian age may have Baltican affi nity
Neoproterozoic to Cambrian rifting was followed by ca481–462 Ma arc magmatism, and the contemporaneous Early–Middle Ordovician M’Clintock orogeny was an intra-arc deformation event (Trettin, 1987), or outboard terrane amalgamation event (McClelland et al., 2012)
481–462 Ma arc magmatism, and the contemporaneous Early–Middle Ordovician M’Clintock orogeny was an intra-arc deformation event (Trettin, 1987), or outboard terrane amalgamation event (McClelland et al., 2012)Accretion to Laurentia is thought to be related to the Caledonian orogen of northeast Greenland (Trettin, 1987)
Following accretion, the Pearya terrane was then translated westward across northern Greenland by Late Silurian sinistral shear zones to its present position (Trettin, 1987), prior to overlap by the Danish River Formation (Trettin, 1991; Klaper, 1992; von Gosen et al., 2012).Based on existing data, there are theoretical inconsistencies within this model, mainly related to ocean closure and subduction
Cambrian mafi c volcanic rocks of the Yelverton and Jaeger Lake Formations are attributed to rifting and extensionArc magmatism extended from ca

440 Ma), but latest Llandovery fossils indicate the base is probably closer to 430 Ma, which is conservatively estimated as ca435 Ma
In fact, strata that postdate the M’Clintock orogeny were not signifi cantly deformed until the Ellesmerian orogeny, sensu stricto in the Late Devonian (Trettin, 1998)If the M’Clintock orogeny was an intra-arc deformation event, then the arc-continent collision has no preserved record of deformation.
If there is a suture zone, then it lies within the mudstone-dominated deep water basin, which does not include ophiolite slivers nor even a Silurian fold-and-thrust beltThose two main inconsistencies also hold true for a modifi ed exotic terrane model where Pearya terrane was accreted to the Laurentian margin during the M’Clintock orogeny.
Transect of detrital zircon spectra of Silurian fl ysch from the Pearya terrane across the deep water basin to the Franklinian shelfSample locations are shown on Figure 2.
First, detrital zircon spectra from Proterozoic samples P-Np1 and P-Np2 are similar to Laurentian reference spectra and Neoproterozoic strata from East Greenland (Fig4), and they are therefore not of an exotic character
Second, a Proterozoic–Cambrian transect shows a gradational change in provenance from the Pearya terrane across the deep water basin to the Franklinian shelf (Fig9)
That relationship supports a linkage between the Pearya terrane and the Franklinian margin in the Early Cambrian, prior to hypothesized ocean closure.Our data do support the proposition that Silurian fl ysch was deposited in an east-west– trending foreland basin superimposed over the deep water basin
Our data do support the proposition that Silurian fl ysch was deposited in an east-west– trending foreland basin superimposed over the deep water basinWe add that the southern margin was fed by Laurentian cratonic sediment sources and that the northern margin was fed by recycled Pearya terrane sources (Fig
Cambrian facies thus defi ne the “deep water basin” between the Franklinian shelf and the Pearya terrane (Fig10A)
Specifi cally, Cambrian mafi c volcanic rocks of the Jaeger Lake and Yelverton Formations and unnamed basalt of the Pearya terrane (M2; Trettin, 1998) are found across the northern Heiberg fold belt, the Deep Water Basin, and Pearya terrane, respectivelyThe Jaeger Lake Formation volcanic rocks are tied to the Franklinian shelf (Trettin , 1998), and so correlation of mafi c volcanic rocks provides a potential Lower Cambrian tie between the Pearya terrane and the Franklinian
The Jaeger Lake Formation volcanic rocks are tied to the Franklinian shelf (Trettin , 1998), and so correlation of mafi c volcanic rocks provides a potential Lower Cambrian tie between the Pearya terrane and the Franklinianshelf
There was a Cambrian phase of extension along the Franklinian and Cordilleran margins (e.g., MacLean, 2011), and Cambrian mafi c volcanism was also active in northeastern Alaska (Moore et al., 1994); hence, it is not unique to the Pearya terrane or the Laurentian passive margin in generalRecent passive margins, such as West Africa and the eastern margin of South America, have exhibited mafi c, particularly alkaline, magmatism up to 100 m.y

The Upper Ordovician Taconite River and Lorimer Ridge Formations contain a combination of Pearya-type basement, near syndepositional ages, and a very minor component of 700–550 Ma zircon agesWe infer that uplift and erosion of Pearya terrane–type basement occurred to the northwest in conjunction with igneous activity
A possible interpretation for the tectonic setting of the Upper Ordovician Pearyan and Franklinian platforms is a retroarc foreland basin (Fig10E)
The depositional record of foreland basins is dominated by collisional events, whereas noncollisional retroarc phases have lower accommodation (e.g., Miall, 1995), consistent with the mixed siliciclasticcarbonate deposits of the Pearya terrane and carbonate facies of the Franklinian shelf in the Upper Ordovician.Silurian fl ysch deposits indicate that the Upper Ordovician platform of the Pearya terrane was drowned by early Llandovery time (Trettin, 1998)
Silurian fl ysch deposits indicate that the Upper Ordovician platform of the Pearya terrane was drowned by early Llandovery time (Trettin, 1998)First, conglomeratic turbidites of the Cranstone Formation were deposited over the Pearya terrane, and volcaniclastic rocks of the Fire Bay Formation were shed into the deep water basin, and then sand-grade turbidites of the Danish River Formation reached the deep water basin by late Llandovery time (Fig
First, conglomeratic turbidites of the Cranstone Formation were deposited over the Pearya terrane, and volcaniclastic rocks of the Fire Bay Formation were shed into the deep water basin, and then sand-grade turbidites of the Danish River Formation reached the deep water basin by late Llandovery time (Fig3)
Detrital zircon age spectra from the Danish River Formation sample P-S2 have very minor Ordovician peaks and no syndepositional ages, suggesting minimal input from arc rocksIt is inferred that basement uplift in the rising orogen prevented both arc and anatectic igneous-sourced sediment from reaching the Pearya terrane.

Turbiditic sandstones of the Danish River Formation were deposited over the Franklinian shelf by latest Silurian to Early DevonianProgressive drowning of the Pearyan and Franklinian platforms is interpreted to refl ect a pulse of foreland-propagating subs idence related to crustal thickening and collision in the hinterland to the northwest (Fig
After drowning and maximum subsidence to form the foreland basin, the Devonian clastic wedge records fi lling of the basin, and Late Devonian–Mississippian Ellesmerian orogeny was related to the terminal phase of foreland deformation (Fig10G).
Although we argue in favor of an alternative model that hearkens back to earlier tectonic interpretations (e.g., Trettin, 1973), knowledge gaps do allow for an origin of the Pearya terrane in East Greenland followed by strike-slip emplacement prior to Silurian deposition of the Danish River FormationFurther work to test the tectonic models could include: conducting more detrital zircon analyses of Cambrian–Ordovician sandstones with clear Franklinian affi nity; documenting Franklinian events within the Pearya terrane, which may include post–720 Ma synrift igneous activity; characterizing Cambrian mafi c volcanic rocks of both Franklinian shelf and Pearya terrane affi nity; and improving our understanding of 1200–900 Ma events in northernmost Laurentia (e.g., Mesoproterozoic–Neoproterozoic Borden Basin).

Development of a retroarc foreland basin followed in the Late OrdovicianA new collisional event drove foreland basin subsidence in the Silurian that drowned the Pearya terrane platform and the Franklinian shelf and resulted in deposition of Silurian fl ysch of the Danish River Formation
A new collisional event drove foreland basin subsidence in the Silurian that drowned the Pearya terrane platform and the Franklinian shelf and resulted in deposition of Silurian fl ysch of the Danish River FormationThe Late Devonian–Mississippian Ellesmerian orogeny was probably of much larger scale, which we speculate was driven by continental-scale collision, and resulted in basin subsidence, expansion, and then infl ux of voluminous siliciclastic sediment to form the Devonian clastic wedge.
