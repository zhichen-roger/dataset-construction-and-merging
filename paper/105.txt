Timing of deep-water slope evolution constrained by large-n detrital and volcanic ash zircon geochronology, Cretaceous Magallanes Basin, ChileBenjamin G
Here, we present >6600 new U-Pb zircon ages with stratigraphic information from an ~100-kmlong by ~2.5-km-thick outcrop belt to elucidate evolutionary timing for a Campanian– Maastrichtian slope succession in the Magallanes Basin, ChileResults show that the succession consists of four stratigraphic intervals, which characterize four evolutionary phases of the slope system
The strata investigated is a 2500-m-thick Campanian– Maastrichtian siliciclastic succession composed of shelf through deep-water slope deposits associated with a high-relief (>1000 m) slope system (cfHubbard et al., 2010; Romans et al., 2011)
The basin is associated with Early Cretaceous–Neogene orogenesis of the southern Patagonian Andes (Dalziel et al., 1974; Natland et al., 1974; Wilson, 1991; Fildani and Hessler, 2005; Fosdick et al., 2011)The development of the basin was linked to a dynamic Mesozoic tectonic history in southernmost South America, including: (1) a Jurassic–Early Cretaceous extensional phase associated with the initial breakup of Gondwana, which resulted in the formation of the Rocas Verdes backarc basin (Pankhurst et al., 2000; Fildani and Hessler, 2005); and (2) a Late Cretaceous–Neogene compressional phase, which led to the development of a pronounced foredeep eastward of the Andean front (Fildani et al., 2003; Fildani and Hessler, 2005; Fosdick et al., 2011; Malkowski et al., 2017).
The development of the basin was linked to a dynamic Mesozoic tectonic history in southernmost South America, including: (1) a Jurassic–Early Cretaceous extensional phase associated with the initial breakup of Gondwana, which resulted in the formation of the Rocas Verdes backarc basin (Pankhurst et al., 2000; Fildani and Hessler, 2005); and (2) a Late Cretaceous–Neogene compressional phase, which led to the development of a pronounced foredeep eastward of the Andean front (Fildani et al., 2003; Fildani and Hessler, 2005; Fosdick et al., 2011; Malkowski et al., 2017).The extensional phase of tectonic evolution in southern Patagonia resulted in crustal attenuation in the Rocas Verdes Basin axis, which was most pronounced in the southern half of the basin (de Wit and Stern, 1981; Stern et al., 1992; Mukasa and Dalziel, 1996; Stern and de Wit, 2003; Romans et al., 2010; Malkowski et al., 2016)
1); the strata record the progressive infilling of the basin by orogen-parallel depositional systems that drained to the south during the Cretaceous (Winn and Dott, 1979; Shultz et al., 2005; Hubbard et al., 2008; Romans et al., 2011).The Tres Pasos Formation is a Campanian– Maastrichtian siliciclastic unit primarily composed of deep-water slope deposits (Fig

Slope clinoform surfaces in the Tres Pasos Formation can, in some places, be correlated updip into deposits of the genetically linked Dorotea Formation, a Campanian–Danian siliciclastic unit of shallow-marine to continental origin (Fig1; Hubbard et al., 2010; Bauer, 2012; Gutiérrez et al., 2017)

A record of magmatism and orogenesis in the Andes of Chilean Patagonia can be gleaned from U-Pb zircon ages from Cretaceous-aged plutonic rocks of the South Patagonian Batholith (cfHervé et al., 2007) and from Cretaceous- to Neogene-aged deposits of the Magallanes Basin (Fig
Hervé et al., 2007) and from Cretaceous- to Neogene-aged deposits of the Magallanes Basin (Fig3; e.g., Fosdick et al., 2015; Schwartz et al., 2016; Gutiérrez et al., 2017)
Campanian–Maastrichtian ages from the South Patagonian Batholith span 81–67 Ma (n = 4; Hervé et al., 2007); this indicates that arc magmatism coupled with convergence and orogenesis created young, zircon-prone material episodically over the life span of the depositional system we investigated hereAge spectra from Cretaceous–Neogene deposits in our study area and in parts of the basin to the north show largely indistinguishable populations of ages older than 84 Ma (Fig

Lag times associated with orogenesis and retroarc shortening in the Campanian–Maastrichtian Andes in Chilean Patagonia are poorly constrainedAs such, the direct influence of orogenesis on slope evolution is difficult to decipher.
The detrital zircon age populations from the Tres Pasos and Dorotea Formations suggest that material from similar source terranes was continuously denuded in the fold-and-thrust belt through the Campanian– Maastrichtian (Figs3 and 9; Romans et al., 2010; Gutiérrez et al., 2017)
Thrust fault propagation in the Campanian–Maastrichtian Andes has been evaluated via examination of faults and shear zones in the Magallanes Basin (Fosdick et al., 2011), which provided a record of thrust sheet activity, as well as the apparent migration patterns of the basin foredeep over timeThese examinations, coupled with observations from the stratigraphic record, led previous workers to deduce that the position of the foredeep at the end of Cerro Toro Formation depositional time was largely similar during Tres Pasos Formation depositional time and did not begin to markedly shift eastward until ca
Records of Late Cretaceous sea-level change from areas near the paleolatitude of the Magallanes Basin are not well constrained; we used the Phanerozoic global sea-level curve of Kominz et al(2008) to investigate a potential sea-level control on slope evolution
The C ampanian– Maastrichtian region of the curve shows periods of prominent sea-level rise over 82.5–81.5, 78.5–77.5, 76.0–75.5, and 70.5–69.0 Ma, and prominent sea-level fall at 81.5–78.5, 77.5– 76.0, and 75.5–70.5 Ma (Fig10; Kominz et al., 2008)
Paleoclimate reconstructions based on the global d18O compilation (Friedrich et al., 2012) suggest a cooling trend from the Turonian through to the mid-Campanian (i.e., >2‰ increase over 15 m.y.) followed by comparably minor and highly variable fluctuations from mid-Campanian through the Maastrichtian (Fig10)
Consider a scenario where MDAs of similar precision were computed for a sedimentary system that was active during the Early Ordovician (485.4–470.0 Ma; duration: 15.4 m.y.)In this case, the MDAs that define the lower and upper bounds of the interval would have absolute 2σ uncertainties that would span ±6.6–11.6 m.y., and computed duration and rate estimates may have large ranges
Evaluation of stratigraphic and zircon- derived U-Pb age data reveals new insight into the evolution of a Campanian–Maastrichtian shelf-slope system in the Magallanes Basin in southern ChileIntegration of new stratigraphic information and >6600 new U-Pb zircon (detrital and volcanic ash) ages reveals a fourphase evolutionary framework associated with a largely progradational shelf-margin system
In general, the absolute uncertainty associated with U-Pb ages from sources that are Paleozoic and older is larger compared to the uncertainty related to ages that are Mesozoic and younger (i.e., 2.0 percent uncertainty on 300 Ma age = ±6 m.y.)Therefore, robust depositional duration and rate constraints for systems active during these time periods may only be possible over 10–100 m.y
