To account for the detrital zircon populations in the Pulo do Lobo Zone we propose derivation from a crustal fragment, which escaped laterally as the result of an early Devonian collision between an Iberian indenter (Gondwana) (Dias & Ribeiro 1995) and LaurussiaOur model not only provides a method for emplacement of the Pulo do Lobo Zone but also potentially explains genetic linkages between enigmatic voluminous magmatism and widespread mineralization in both the Meguma terrane of the Northern Appalachians and the Iberian Pyrite Belt of the South Portuguese Zone not accounted for in other models.

Consequently, the age distributions of these samples suggest that the detritus in the Pulo do Lobo Zone was not derived from Gondwana (Ossa– Morena Zone), nor from the sources of the late Devonian clastic rocks (Phyllite Quartzite Group) of the South Portuguese Zone or peri-Gondwanan terranes that flanked the margin of Laurentia and Baltica in the Devono-Carboniferous.Taken together these interpretations suggest that the quartzite phacoids and matrix (Ala´jar me´lange) and metasediments (Ribeira de Limas formation) of the Pulo do Lobo Zone were derived from either Baltica or Laurentia

Thus the Pulo do Lobo Zone sediments were not only derived from Laurentia and/or Baltica but also probably derived from early Silurian rocks associated with the closure of the Iapetus, along the eastern margin ofAn example of one such potential source is the early Silurian Southern Uplands terrane of the British Caledonides (Fig

To a first order, the data suggest that during at least the early to middle Devonian the South Portuguese Zone was outboard of the Gondwanan margin (Ossa–Morena Zone)This interpretation is consistent with late Palaeozoic calc-alkaline andesitic arc magmatism present in the Ossa–Morena Zone (Jesus et al

Therefore the South Portuguese Zone basement is either a rifted Silurian West African ribbon continent that derived late Devonian passive margin clastic rocks from itself or peri-Gondwanan Meguma basement with Phyllite Quartzite Group clastic rocks sourced from the Meguma Group, which is dominated by c0.6–2.1 Ga detritus (Krogh & Keppie 1990; Waldron et al

However, the Phyllite Quartzite Group (JB-17) contains a paucity of Mesoproterozoic zircons (Fig3), the lack of which is generally considered a fingerprint of West African provenance (e.g

Using this general reconstruction, we propose that early Devonian oblique collision between an Iberian indenter and Laurussia and the existence of a small remnant ocean basin (reentrant) between southern Iberia, North Africa and the northern Appalachians resulted in tectonic escape of a crustal fragment correlative with the Southern Uplands of the British Caledonides across the remnant oceanThis escape was accommodated by development of a new subduction zone beneath the Ossa– Morena Zone (Fig

In this model, northwesterly subduction beneath Laurussia in the Late Silurian was disrupted by collision with the Iberian promontory of Gondwana such that oblique subduction with a sinistral component commenced beneath the Ossa–Morena ZoneThis subduction was accompanied by the generation of the sinistral South Iberian Shear Zone (Crespo-Blanc & Orozco 1988) and a tectonic free face (e.g

During the stages of tectonic escape, late Devonian passive margin deposits (Phyllite Quartzite Group), probably sourced from the Meguma terrane, were deposited on South Portuguese Zone basement, which was part of the escaping blockAs these are passive margin deposits they are probably only indicative of a local passive margin setting in basins within the escaping block

This model is consistent with (1) documented dextral movement in the Meguma terrane relative to Avalonia in the northern Appalachians (Keppie & Dallmeyer 1987), (2) the late Devonian–early Carboniferous transtension required for bimodal volcanism (c355–330 Ma) of the Iberian Pyrite Belt (e.g

Although these connections are independent of the derivation of the Pulo do Lobo Zone they further support both a detrital zircon genetic linkage between the South Portuguese Zone and the Meguma terrane and a Devono-Carboniferous tectonic escape mechanism as the probable mode of transport for part of the Laurentian– Iapetan suture (Southern Uplands?) toward the Ossa–Morena Zone.The eventual juxtaposition of rocks from the Southern Uplands equivalent terrane with a Rheic subduction zone beneath the Ossa–Morena Zone (Fig
