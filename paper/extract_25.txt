The Himalayan–Tibetan Plateau is an amalgamation of individual terranes that detached from northern Gondwana and accreted onto southern Asia in a series of collision during Paleozoic and Cenozoic (Allègre et al., 1984; Dewey et al., 1988; Gehrels et al., 2011; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Zhu et al., 2013)The Lhasa terrane, bounded by the Bangong–Nujiang suture zone in the north and the Indus–Yarlung Tsangpo suture zone in the south (Fig

The collision between South and North Lhasa terranes led to the Triassic high-grade metamorphism (Dong et al., 2011a; Lin et al., 2013b; Weller et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014) and widespread crustal anatexis (Li et al., 2009a, 2012; Zhang et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011b).Detrital zircons from the metasedimentary rocks in the Nyingchi Complex in the eastern South Lhasa terrane define four age populations of 330–364 Ma, 490–800 Ma, 1000–1200 Ma, and 1500–1800 Ma

The weighted mean ages of the youngest three detrital zircons indicate Carboniferous (~330 Ma) depositional age for their sedimentary protolithsThe protoliths of the metasedimentary rocks were derived from the Lhasa terrane itself (South and North Lhasa terranes)

The presence of abundant 330–364 Ma detrital zircons indicates that the Lhasa terrane was characterized by Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous magmatismThe zircon trace-element signature and Hf isotopic composition indicate that the magmatic host rocks of the 364–330 Ma detrital zircons formed in an arc-back-arc system, which resulted from the southward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys oceanic crust during Late Devonian-Early Carboniferous

The zircon trace-element signature and Hf isotopic composition indicate that the magmatic host rocks of the 364–330 Ma detrital zircons formed in an arc-back-arc system, which resulted from the southward subduction of the Paleo-Tethys oceanic crust during Late Devonian-Early CarboniferousThis back-arc basin subsequently developed into the Sumdo Paleo-Tethys ocean.
