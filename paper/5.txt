Constraining the early Mesozoic paleogeography of the Neo– Tethyan Ocean margins is crucial for understanding the opening history of the Neo–Tethyan Ocean and the paleoposition of the southern margin of Eurasia (the Lhasa terrane) and the northern margin of India (the Tethyan Himalaya)Upper Triassic strata are well exposed in the Tethyan Himalaya (Liu and Einsele, 1994; Aikman et al., 2008; Dai et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010), the Lhasa terrane (Li et al., 2014), northwest Australia (Lewis and Sircombe, 2013) and southeast Asia (Gunawan et al., 2012;
Upper Triassic strata are well exposed in the Tethyan Himalaya (Liu and Einsele, 1994; Aikman et al., 2008; Dai et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010), the Lhasa terrane (Li et al., 2014), northwest Australia (Lewis and Sircombe, 2013) and southeast Asia (Gunawan et al., 2012;Zimmermann and Hall, 2014; Sevastjanova et al., 2015)
At present, however, there is little consensus about the paleogeography of these assemblages during Late Triassic time.Several tectonic models have been proposed to explain the provenance and paleogeographic relationships between the Upper Triassic Langjiexue Formation in the Tethyan Himalaya and age-equivalent units deposited in the Lhasa terrane (Fig
Several tectonic models have been proposed to explain the provenance and paleogeographic relationships between the Upper Triassic Langjiexue Formation in the Tethyan Himalaya and age-equivalent units deposited in the Lhasa terrane (Fig1)
These opposing models result in paleogeographic reconstructions that place the Langjiexue Formation on opposite sides of the Neo– Tethyan Ocean during the Late Triassic.Models favoring an allochthonous origin were proposed to explain the presence of Permian–Triassic detrital zircons and high whole-rock εNd(t) values in the Langjiexue Formation (Dai et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010)
Models favoring an allochthonous origin were proposed to explain the presence of Permian–Triassic detrital zircons and high whole-rock εNd(t) values in the Langjiexue Formation (Dai et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010)These models invoke a number of explanations that fall into three broad categories (Webb et al., 2013)
This model requires that India–Lhasa terrane rifting initiated during the Late Triassic(2) Lhasa forearc: detritus was shed from a Triassic arc that developed along the southern Lhasa terrane and was deposited in a forearc basin (Li et al., 2010)
(2) Lhasa forearc: detritus was shed from a Triassic arc that developed along the southern Lhasa terrane and was deposited in a forearc basin (Li et al., 2010)This model requires northward subduction of Neo–Tethyan oceanic lithosphere during the Triassic and an oceanic suture zone between the Langjiexue Formation and Indian-affinity Tethyan Himalya strata to the south (Li et al., 2010)
This model requires northward subduction of Neo–Tethyan oceanic lithosphere during the Triassic and an oceanic suture zone between the Langjiexue Formation and Indian-affinity Tethyan Himalya strata to the south (Li et al., 2010)(3) Intra-oceanic forearc: detritus was derived from a south-facing intra-oceanic arc within the Neo–Tethyan Ocean (Li et al., 2010)
This model requires that Neo–Tethyan oceanic lithosphere was subducted northward beneath at least one Neo–Tethyan intra-oceanic arc, in addition to beneath the Lhasa terrane during Triassic time.In an effort to discriminate among the contrasting models of early Mesozoic paleogeography, we conducted sandstone petrologic and U–Pb detrital zircon geochronologic studies on Upper Triassic strata exposed in the Tethyan Himalaya Sequence and southern Lhasa terrane of southern Tibet
In an effort to discriminate among the contrasting models of early Mesozoic paleogeography, we conducted sandstone petrologic and U–Pb detrital zircon geochronologic studies on Upper Triassic strata exposed in the Tethyan Himalaya Sequence and southern Lhasa terrane of southern TibetIntegration of our new, and previously published data indicate that the Langjiexue and Nieru formations (Fig
We propose that the northeast Greater Indian shelf and northwest Australian shelf were contiguous during Late Triassic time and accommodated deposition of a submarine fan complexes that were deposited in the Neo–Tethyan Ocean between West Papua to the east and India–Australia to the south.Our study area consists of three major tectonic units from north to south: the Lhasa terrane; the Yarlung–Tsangpo (India– Asia) suture zone (YZSZ); and the Tethyan Himalaya Sequence (Fig
The Lhasa terrane is composed of Neoproterozoic to Lower Cambrian basement, Paleozoic to Cenozoic cover strata and igneous rocks, and Gangdese continental margin arc rocks (e.g., Gehrels et al., 2012)The Gangdese arc mainly consists of Cretaceous to early Cenozoic calc–alkaline granitoids (Chu et al., 2006) and coeval volcanic sequences (He et al., 2007)
The Gangdese arc mainly consists of Cretaceous to early Cenozoic calc–alkaline granitoids (Chu et al., 2006) and coeval volcanic sequences (He et al., 2007)The presence of diamictites and cool-water faunas in Carboniferous–Lower Permian strata suggest that the Lhasa terrane was located along the margin of Gondwana during this time (Ji et al., 2005; Yuan et al., 2015)
The presence of diamictites and cool-water faunas in Carboniferous–Lower Permian strata suggest that the Lhasa terrane was located along the margin of Gondwana during this time (Ji et al., 2005; Yuan et al., 2015)Warm-water faunas have been identified in Middle– Upper Permian strata (Yuan et al., 2015)
Warm-water faunas have been identified in Middle– Upper Permian strata (Yuan et al., 2015)This faunal change is attributed to either palaeoclimate change or northward drift of the Lhasa terrane into a warm-water regime (Yuan et al., 2015)
The Cretaceous to Eocene Xigaze forearc basin is exposed along the southern margin of Lhasa terrane and was derived from the southern Lhasa terrane continental margin (Fig1; Dürr, 1996; Orme et al., 2015)
In the eastern Himalaya, the Xigaze forearc basin is absent and the Gangdese arc was thrust southward over the Yarlung–Tsangpo suture zone (YZSZ) in the hanging wall of the Gangdese thrust during Oligocene–Miocene time (Yin et al., 1994).The YZSZ defines the boundary between Indian- and Asianaffinity assemblages
Supra-subduction zone ophiolitic rocks exposed between the Zedang and Yungbwa areas formed during the Early Cretaceous (Fig1; Hébert et al., 2012 and references therein)
Radiolarian assemblages in chert sequences range from late Middle Triassic to Early Cretaceous in age (Matsuoka et al., 2002; Ziabrev et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2005)To the south is a trench–fill basin composed of strongly-cleaved Cretaceous sandstone, shale and conglomerate in a highly sheared mudstone matrix (Cai et al., 2012)
To the south is a trench–fill basin composed of strongly-cleaved Cretaceous sandstone, shale and conglomerate in a highly sheared mudstone matrix (Cai et al., 2012)These units comprise a southward-younging accretionary complex that developed during the northward subduction of Neo–Tethyan Ocean beneath Lhasa terrane during Cretaceous time (Cai et al., 2012).
These units comprise a southward-younging accretionary complex that developed during the northward subduction of Neo–Tethyan Ocean beneath Lhasa terrane during Cretaceous time (Cai et al., 2012).The northern Tethyan Himalaya Sequence (THS) includes Paleozoic to Eocene carbonate and clastic sedimentary rocks that were deposited on the distal passive continental margin of India (Searle et al., 1987; Liu and Einsele, 1994)
The northern Tethyan Himalaya Sequence (THS) includes Paleozoic to Eocene carbonate and clastic sedimentary rocks that were deposited on the distal passive continental margin of India (Searle et al., 1987; Liu and Einsele, 1994)Tethyan Himalaya Sequence strata were predominately derived from Gondwanan sources based on numerous stratigraphic and detrital zircon studies (e.g
Emplacement of continental flood basalts in various areas of the Indian passive margin suggests the Neo–Tethys Ocean began to form during early Permian time (Garzanti et al., 1999).C = clay, S = silt, F = Fine sand, M = Middle sand, C = Coarse sand.
Several exposures of Upper Triassic strata in the southern Lhasa terrane and Tethyan Himalaya were measured and sampled for sandstone petrographic and detrital zircon provenance analysis (Figs1 and 2)
These fossils indicate a Carnian to Norian depositional age (Ji et al., 2003)The fossil assemblage, lithologies, and sedimentary structures in the Mailonggang Formation imply a carbonate–clastic platform depositional environment (Li et al., 2014)
The Upper Triassic Langjiexue Formation is exposed between the Renbu–Zedang Thrust to the north and an unnamed thrust fault with Jurassic–Cretaceous strata in the footwall to the south (Fig1; Aikman et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010)
Pluriadiata, Burmiesia–Unionites, Cassianella nyanangensis– Schafhaeutlis mengllingi) and gastropod fossils indicate a Carnian– Norian depositional age for the Langjiexue Formation (Yu and Zhen, 1979)Flutecasts indicate southwest-directed paleocurrents (Li et al., 2003)
Ammonite fossils indicate a Carnian–Norian depositional age (Yu and Zhen, 1979)One siltstone was sampled for detrital zircon analysis (Fig
Bivalve fossils including Halobia indicate a Carnian– Norian depositional age (Yu and Zhen, 1979)Seven sandstones from this unit were sampled for detrital zircon analysis (Fig
The Upper Triassic Mungaroo Formation of the North Carnarvon basin in Northwest Australia contains 900–500 Ma, 1300–1000 Ma, 250–190 Ma, and 2000–1500 Ma age populations (Lewis and Sircombe, 2013)The main peak in the range of 250–190 Ma is centered at ∼214 Ma (Lewis and Sircombe, 2013)
The Upper Triassic strata in the outer Banda Arc Islands and West Papua are the equivalent of Mesozoic sandstones along the northern Australian margin (Bird and Cook, 1991)The Upper Triassic strata in the outer Banda Arc Islands contain a population of detrital zircon U–Pb ages between 400 Ma and 200 Ma and a few ages in the 2000–1500 Ma range, which were interpreted be derived from West Papua (Zimmermann and Hall, 2014)
The Upper Triassic strata in the outer Banda Arc Islands contain a population of detrital zircon U–Pb ages between 400 Ma and 200 Ma and a few ages in the 2000–1500 Ma range, which were interpreted be derived from West Papua (Zimmermann and Hall, 2014)Upper Triassic strata in West Papua are dominated by age populations at 280–200 Ma and are accompanied by a few ages in the 1500–2000 Ma range (Gunawan et al., 2012)
Upper Triassic strata in West Papua are dominated by age populations at 280–200 Ma and are accompanied by a few ages in the 1500–2000 Ma range (Gunawan et al., 2012)The Upper Triassic Pane Chaung Formation in West Myanmar is dominated by populations at 1400–700 Ma, 700–500 Ma, and 350–200 Ma, which are similar to those of the outer Banda Arc (Sevastjanova et al., 2015)

Detrital zircon ages in Cambrian–Cretaceous strata of the Tethyan Himalaya Sequence are dominated by populations at 570–480 Ma, 1200–750 Ma, and 2560–2430 Ma (Myrow et al., 2003; Gehrels et al., 2012)
Cretaceous strata of the Tethyan Himalaya Sequence are dominated by populations at 570–480 Ma, 1200–750 Ma, and 2560–2430 Ma (Myrow et al., 2003; Gehrels et al., 2012)The Lhasa terrane records a protracted magmatic history that includes mainly Cretaceous to Paleogene and subordinate Devonian to Jurassic plutons and volcanic rocks (Chu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2012)
The Lhasa terrane records a protracted magmatic history that includes mainly Cretaceous to Paleogene and subordinate Devonian to Jurassic plutons and volcanic rocks (Chu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011; Ji et al., 2012)Detrital zircon ages in preCenozoic sedimentary strata of the Lhasa terrane display major age populations in the range of 160–100 Ma, 260–180 Ma, 700–500 Ma, and 1300–800 Ma with minor age populations between 2000–1800 Ma and 2500–2400 Ma (Leier et al., 2007; Pullen et al., 2008; Gehrels et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014)
Detrital zircon ages in preCenozoic sedimentary strata of the Lhasa terrane display major age populations in the range of 160–100 Ma, 260–180 Ma, 700–500 Ma, and 1300–800 Ma with minor age populations between 2000–1800 Ma and 2500–2400 Ma (Leier et al., 2007; Pullen et al., 2008; Gehrels et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014)Upper Triassic strata of the South Qiangtang terrane are dominated by populations between 300–200 Ma and 2.0–1.8 Ga with a few ages in the 1000–500 Ma range (Gehrels et al., 2012).
Upper Triassic strata of the South Qiangtang terrane are dominated by populations between 300–200 Ma and 2.0–1.8 Ga with a few ages in the 1000–500 Ma range (Gehrels et al., 2012).Sandstone compositions in the Mailonggang Formation of the southern Lhasa terrane indicate a recycled orogen provenance
The cluster of U–Pb zircon ages between 350–250 Ma suggests derivation from proximal Carboniferous–Permian igneous rocks in the Lhasa terraneThe absence of 1.8 Ga zircons in these samples and a paucity of ages between 300–200 Ma indicate that the South Qiangtang terrane is an unlikely source (Fig
Pan-African (600–500 Ma) and Grenville (1000–800 Ma) grains in these samples were most likely derived from the widely exposed Neoproterozoic–Cambrian and Grenville orogenic belts in eastern Gondwana (Fitzsimons, 2000; Veevers et al., 2006)Hence, the Indian continent was the likely source of sandstones in the Upper Triassic Nieru Formation near Lazi
Hence, the Indian continent was the likely source of sandstones in the Upper Triassic Nieru Formation near LaziThe Nieru Formation in the Kangma region, however, contains 300–200 Ma detrital zircons that are similar to those of the Langjiexue Formation and Upper Triassic Mungaroo Formation of the Carnarvon basin in northwest Australia (Lewis and Sircombe, 2013; Fig
The Nieru Formation in the Kangma region, however, contains 300–200 Ma detrital zircons that are similar to those of the Langjiexue Formation and Upper Triassic Mungaroo Formation of the Carnarvon basin in northwest Australia (Lewis and Sircombe, 2013; Fig8).
Compositions of sandstones in the Upper Triassic Langjiexue Formation indicate a recycled orogen provenance (Dickinson, 1985)The most conspicuous detrital zircon age probability peak within the Langjiexue Formation is between 300 Ma and 200 Ma, with an asymmetric peak centered at ∼230 Ma (Fig
This interpretation is supported by observations that include south-directed paleocurrent indicators (Li et al., 2003), juvenile source rocks inferred from geochemical and Nd isotopic compositions of the Langjiexue Formation (Dai et al., 2008), Paleozoic and Mesozoic arc magmatism (Chu et al., 2006; Ji et al., 2012) and 300–200 Ma detrital zircons in Jurassic strata in the Lhasa terrane (Fig8; Leier et al., 2007)
The Mailonggang Formation is dominated by Carboniferous–Permian detrital zircons, which differs from the dominant Triassic age peak in the Langjiexue Formation (Fig8)
A tectonic model that can reconcile these differences involves the development of the Neo–Tethyan Ocean to accommodated the deposition of the Uppert Triassic chert that separates Upper Triassic strata along the Indian and Asian sides of the Yarlung–Tsangpo sutureIn this model, provenance variations result from separation by Neo–Tethyan Ocean basins
When we compare our detrital zircon age spectra to new geochronologic data from northwest Australia (Lewis and Sircombe, 2013), Timor (Zimmermann and Hall, 2014), Sulawesi (Hennig et al., 2015) and West Papua (Gunawan et al., 2012), the presence of similar Permian–Triassic detrital zircons populations raises consideration of a tectonic model in which the Langjiexue and Nieru (Kangma) formations in Tethyan Himalaya Sequence and age-equivalent strata in the north Australia margin and outer Banda arc were derived from similar source rocksThe absence of a Permian–Triassic detrital zircon source in the Indian continent and similar detrital zircon age spectra of Permian–Triassic strata in West Papua, Timor, Sulawesi and north Australia (Fig
The absence of a Permian–Triassic detrital zircon source in the Indian continent and similar detrital zircon age spectra of Permian–Triassic strata in West Papua, Timor, Sulawesi and north Australia (Fig8) suggest that the most likely source rocks were the volcanic arc rocks related to the subduction of Panthalassic oceanic lithosphere beneath West Papua (Gunawan et al., 2012; Zimmermann and Hall, 2014).
The Upper Triassic Langjiexue Formation provides an important provenance constraint that links Greater India and continental rocks along the northern margin of Australia during the Late TriassicOriginally, the Langjiexue Formation was interpreted to have been deposited on the distal part of the Tethyan Himalaya passive margin (Liu and Einsele, 1994; Searle et al., 1987)
Simplified Late Triassic paleogeographic reconstruction of the Neo–Tethyan margins.India, which was located to the south (Li et al., 2003)
This model requires that India–Lhasa rifting occurred during the Late Triassic–Lower JurassicThere is substantial evidence, however, that the Lhasa terrane rifted from Gondwana prior to late Triassic time (Garzanti et al., 1999; Sciunnach and Garzanti, 2012)
There is substantial evidence, however, that the Lhasa terrane rifted from Gondwana prior to late Triassic time (Garzanti et al., 1999; Sciunnach and Garzanti, 2012)The third class of models argues that the Langjiexue Formation was deposited in an intra-oceanic or Lhasa terrane forearc basin (Li et al., 2010, 2014)
This hypothesis is also incompatible with known geological constraints, as (1) no Triassic intra-oceanic arc fragments have been documented within the YZSZ, (2) the recycled orogen provenance of the Mailonggang and Langjiexue formations is inconsistent with deposition in a forearc basin (Dickinson, 1985), and (3) the location of the Langjiexue Formation with respect to the YZSZ would require back–arc extension to rift the Langjiexue Formation from Lhasa terraneThe latter is inconsistent with recent studies indicating that the YZSZ ophiolites to the north developed in an extensional forearc rather than a back-arc setting (Maffione et al., 2015).
This interpretation requires that during Late Triassic time, northeast Greater India remained attached to Northwest Australia (Fig9; Metcalfe, 2013)
Furthermore, we assert that the Lhasa terrane had already rifted from Greater India and was isolated from India-derived sedimentation by the Neo–Tethyan Ocean during Late Triassic timeWe propose that a submarine fan complex developed between Papua New Guinea to the east and the North Australia shelf to the south during the Late Triassic, overlapping all terranes along the northern margin of east Gondwana (Fig
We propose that a submarine fan complex developed between Papua New Guinea to the east and the North Australia shelf to the south during the Late Triassic, overlapping all terranes along the northern margin of east Gondwana (Fig9; Gunawan et al., 2012; Lewis and Sircombe, 2013; Zimmermann and Hall, 2014; Hennig et al., 2015)
This configuration facilitated long-distance transport of sediment along the north margin of Australia and onto Greater India during late TriassicUpper Triassic strata in the outer Banda arc and west Sulawesi are dominated by Permian–Triassic detrital zircons which were derived from West Papua (Zimmermann and Hall, 2014; Hennig et al., 2015)
Upper Triassic strata in the outer Banda arc and west Sulawesi are dominated by Permian–Triassic detrital zircons which were derived from West Papua (Zimmermann and Hall, 2014; Hennig et al., 2015)Furthermore, west–southwestward paleocurrent indicators identified in West Timor strata suggest an overall east to west transport of sediment (Bird and Cook, 1991).
This interpretation explains the observation that the age-equivalent strata in Tethyan Himalaya, Northwest Australia, Timor, and West Sulawesi all contain abundant Permian–Triassic detrital zircons and exhibit similar sedimentary facies (Fig9)
In addition, Greater India experienced anticlockwise rotation during its Cretaceous northward drift (Huang et al., 2015), such that originally west-directed paleocurrent indicators would have been rotated to the modern southerly trend observed (Li et al., 2003).The Upper Triassic Nieru Formation in the Lazi region is typical of a shallow marine depositional setting
