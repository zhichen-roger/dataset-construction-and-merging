The Oligocene–Miocene Kailas Formation is exposed along strike for ~1300 km within the southernmost Lhasa terraneIn this study, we documented the sedimentology, structure, and age of this unit exposed between 87°E and 90°E
In particular, the geodynamic origin of the thick (>4 km in some localities), continental Kailas Formation, deposited in the center of the largest Cenozoic continent-continent collision zone, is still debated (Aitchison et al., 2002, 2007; DeCelles et al., 2011; SLi et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015)
The southernmost of these continental fragments is the Lhasa terrane, which collided with Asia during Early Cretaceous time (Kapp et al., 2007)The appearance of Asian detritus in Tethyan Himalayan (Indian passive margin) strata beginning at ca
Sedimentation in the Xigaze forearc basin began as early as Barremian time and continued until the early Eocene (51 Ma; Einsele et al., 1994; Dürr, 1996; Ziabrev et al., 2003; Orme et al., 2014; An et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2015a; Huang et al., 2015)South of the forearc basin, the India-Asia suture zone (IASZ on Fig
The ophiolites, where dated, are Jurassic–Early Cretaceous in age and were accreted onto the southern side of the forearc domain before India-Asia collision (Guilmette et al., 2009, 2012; Cai et al., 2012)Mélange complexes were formed structurally below ophiolites and have been proposed to represent the accretionary complex and subduction channel associated with Tethyan oceanic subduction (Tapponnier et al., 1981; Burg and Chen 1984; Searle et al., 1987; Cai et al., 2012; An et al., 2015)
In various localities along strike, the Great Counter Thrust places Tethyan Himalayan rocks over suture zone rocks, Xigaze forearc rocks above the Kailas Formation, or ophiolitic and Tethyan rocks over other Cenozoic conglomerates within the suture zone such as the Liuqu ConglomerateDisplacement estimates for the Great Counter Thrust are >38 km in western Tibet (Murphy and Yin, 2003) and between >12 km and 60 km in eastern Tibet (Yin, 2006).
At the Dazhuka locality, the southern thrust contact of the Kailas Formation is with the Triassic Renbu mélange (Cai et al., 2011; Li et al., 2010; the Bainang terrane of Aitchison et al., 2000)Bedding within all Kailas sections studied here dips generally to the south.
This section dips 40°S and contains an ~100-m-wide footwall syncline below a south-dipping thrust contact with Triassic mélange rocks (Cai et al., 2011).We documented the depositional environment of the Kailas Formation through facies analysis of ~3200 m of measured stratigraphic section at three localities (Figs
The lower member rests nonconformably on Gangdese granite, although the contact is covered by Quaternary colluvium.The lower member at this location is composed almost entirely of massive, disorganized, and poorly sorted, clast-supported boulder conglomerate (Gcm; Fig
(2013), who reported a single 31 Ma grain at the base of this section as well as palynology results suggesting that the Qiuwu Formation (stratigraphically below 1XK) was deposited during late Oligocene time (Li, 2004).In the lower portion of the Dazhuka locality, zircons from a trachyandesite flow yielded a U-Pb age of 22.9 ± 0.3 Ma (n = 64; 1DK-246; Fig
(2011) to rollback of the subducted Indian slab based on several lines of evidence: (1) The along-strike continuity of the Kailas Formation suggests that the mechanism driving subsidence must have been regional in scale; (2) spatio-temporal analy sis of magmatic patterns north of the India-Asia suture zone reveals a 600 km southward sweep in magmatism between 32 Ma and 25 Ma (for western Tibet), a pattern similar to slab rollback processes documented elsewhere (e.g., Humphreys, 1995); (3) a pulse of adakitic and high-K magmatism across the Lhasa terrane at 25–20 Ma suggests slab breakoff (e.g., Maheo et al., 2002; Chung et al., 2003; Williams et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2014); and (4) tomographic studies infer large, high-velocity zones in the mantle beneath Tibet as representing two separate, foundered slabs, one related to initial collision, and a second potentially linked to Oligocene–Miocene rollback followed by slab breakoff (e.g., Replumaz et al., 2010a, 2014).Slab rollback processes beneath Tibet must be distinguished from oceanic slab rollback processes documented in the Mediterranean region (e.g., Jolivet and Brun, 2010; Jolivet et al., 2013) and continental slab rollback processes proposed to explain anomalous subsidence in the Alpine foreland basin (Schlunegger and Kissling, 2015)
In contrast, the mantle anomalies interpreted as the remnants of Oligocene–Miocene breakoff in southern Tibet are currently located ~800 km south of the India-Asia suture zone (Replumaz et al., 2010a, 2014)This indicates that, unlike subduction zones in the eastern Mediterranean, the India-Asia subduction zone has experienced overall trench advance relative to the mantle
Together, the Kailas sedimentary record, magmatic record, east-west extensional record, and tomography data all support the hypothesis that the Oligocene–Miocene tectonic evolution of southern Tibet was driven by Indian slab dynamics.Based on the younging of adakitic magmatism from the eastern syntaxis to the central India-Asia suture zone, Zhang et al
The Oligocene–Miocene Kailas Formation exposed along the southern margin of the Lhasa terrane was deposited in alluvial-fan and fluvial environments within an extensional basin settingThis study provides new constraints on the depositional age of the Kailas Formation in this region and shows that its depositional age becomes younger to the east between 81°E and 90°E
