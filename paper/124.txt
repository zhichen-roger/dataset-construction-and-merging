This combination of methods is applied to the Chattian–Aquitanian (25–23 Ma) Macigno turbidite complexBasin-fill patterns and petrographical studies consistently identify the uplifting western Central Alps as the main source region for the Macigno Formation.
In huge volumes of these metamorphic rocks, mica Ar–Ar and zircon fissiontrack thermochronometers have been reset, because of high geothermal gradients in the vicinity of the Periadriatic intrusives in mid-Oligocene timesAt the present surface of the Alps, zircon FT ages around and slightly less than 30 Ma are reported in the Sesia-Lanzo zone, the Gran Paradiso Massif, the Upper Pennine nappes, the Monte Rosa Massif, and the Dent Blanche complex
The older subgroup of the Tertiary zircons (40 Ma) may have been supplied by metamorphic and migmatitic rocks affected by an Eocene high-temperature phase.A Late Cretaceous age cluster (; 70–60 Ma) is related to cooling after the main Austroalpine metamorphic event at 110–100 Ma
A Late Cretaceous age cluster (; 70–60 Ma) is related to cooling after the main Austroalpine metamorphic event at 110–100 MaMost of the recently exposed Austroalpine nappe complex displays mica cooling ages and zircon FT ages between 95–70 Ma and 99–55 Ma, respectively.
Finally, an ill-defined Jurassic age cluster, with a mean in Late Jurassic times, is related to rift-shoulder heating of the Austroalpine/ South-Alpine crystalline basement due to rifting of the Pennine oceanic domainPresently, the Silvretta nappe complex, situated at the western termination of the Austroalpine realm, and the South-Alpine basement west of the Canavese Line, display similar zircon FT ages
Presently, the Silvretta nappe complex, situated at the western termination of the Austroalpine realm, and the South-Alpine basement west of the Canavese Line, display similar zircon FT agesTherefore, a westward continuation of the Silvretta complex prior to deep Neogene erosion is suggested.

This paper uses an integrated approach on the Macigno turbidites, a foreland-basin sequence deposited in the Northern Apennines thrust and fold belt during late Chattian to early Aquitanian times (25–23 Ma)Information from FT analyses and zircon morphology is combined with available data on quantitative sandstone petrology and basin-fill patterns in order to better distinguish the sources of these thick clastic sediments, funneled by turbidity currents into a deep marine foreland-basin system.
The Northern Apennines are basically composed of two tectonic complexes: (1) the remnants of a Cretaceous–Paleogene accretionary wedge (Ligurian Complex) generated by Africa–Europe convergenceThis unit is thrusted on top of (2) an Oligocene–Miocene complex consisting mainly of clastic units (Ricci Lucchi 1986) that were accreted in a retreating subduction zone and overrode the Adriatic continental margin (e.g., Castellarin 1992)
This unit is thrusted on top of (2) an Oligocene–Miocene complex consisting mainly of clastic units (Ricci Lucchi 1986) that were accreted in a retreating subduction zone and overrode the Adriatic continental margin (e.g., Castellarin 1992)These turbidite clastic units comprise the Macigno and Modino successions of late Chattian to early Aquitanian age (25–23 Ma), the Monte Cervarola Formation of late Aquitanian to early Langhian age (21–16 Ma), and the Marnoso-arenacea Formation of Langhian to Tortonian age (14–9 Ma).
These turbidite clastic units comprise the Macigno and Modino successions of late Chattian to early Aquitanian age (25–23 Ma), the Monte Cervarola Formation of late Aquitanian to early Langhian age (21–16 Ma), and the Marnoso-arenacea Formation of Langhian to Tortonian age (14–9 Ma).Three samples from the Macigno Formation have been analyzed
have lost their predepositional FT ages and cannot be used as provenance indicators, although the ages do reflect cooling from a post-Oligocene thermal/burial eventBecause this burial temperature was insufficient to anneal the fission tracks in zircon crystals, the inherited ages mirror the thermal history of the source regions.
The petrology of the clastic sediments provides a record of the changing geology of the Western and Central Alps during Late Oligocene–Early Miocene uplift, and the geology of the source area, the Western and Central Alps, provides keyFIG
Besides the very pronounced Oligocene age cluster, a smaller Late Cretaceous and a Jurassic cluster can be detected.The typological analyses of the zircon crystals (according to Pupin 1980) show a broad distribution with some clusters (Fig
The Eocene–Oligocene Periadriatic magmatic suite contains mainly ‘‘S’’-type crystals (especially the S7–S12 fields); the ‘‘P’’-type crystals areTABLE 2.—Ages of the crystal populations grouped according to the chi-square test
In the Oligocene populations the euhedral grains are represented by a higher proportion than the rounded onesIt is an indication of the Tertiary volcanigenic contribution.
Eocene and Oligocene subclusters are separated better.The younger, Tertiary age clusters of all three samples consist of two subpopulations
The older is of Eocene age (mean ca39 Ma); the younger is Oligocene (calculated mean of ca
39 Ma); the younger is Oligocene (calculated mean of ca28 Ma) if the splits are made at 33 and 48 Ma
The main part of the Oligocene igneous bodies underwent rather rapid exhumation, as suggested by cooling ages (zircon FT: 28 to 25 Ma) and the appearance of the tonalite boulders in South-Alpine Oligocene sediments (Gieger and Hurford 1989)The data indicate that the Macigno Trough was also supplied from this actively exhuming belt.
South of the Periadriatic volcanic belt s.s., in the southern part of the Po Basin, boreholes penetrate Oligocene stratovolcanic complexes of dacitic and andesitic composition (Fantoni et al1999)
The first sediments onlapping the Mortara-Lacchiarella volcanoes are Langhian in age (; 16.4–14.7 Ma)Thus the volcanic complex probably emerged during deposition of the Macigno Formation, potentially supplying volcaniclastic material and euhedral zircons
The Eocene Age Cluster.—The older subgroup of the Tertiary zircons (Fig10) might also be derived from igneous rocks
Villa (1983) and Dunkl (1990) reported Eocene intrusive and tuffitic formations along the Periadriatic magmatic chainAn unannealed apatite FT age of 39 6 4 Ma is indicated in euhedral crystals of probable volcanic origin in the Eocene Gallare Marls (Lacchiarella subsurface near Milano; Fantoni et al
An unannealed apatite FT age of 39 6 4 Ma is indicated in euhedral crystals of probable volcanic origin in the Eocene Gallare Marls (Lacchiarella subsurface near Milano; Fantoni et al1999)
Nevertheless, meta-igneous rocks of the Central and Western Alps were possibly also affected by the Eocene high-temperature metamorphic phase (Rubatto et al1997) and provided this material to the Macigno Basin.
9), the relationship to known Oligocene magmatic counterparts is not as obvious as for the S-type crystalsThis kind of crystal is rather typical of alkaline granite
The splitting of the Paleogene grains into an Eocene and an Oligocene age cluster is not as evident for rounded grains as for euhedral grains (Fig10)
These grains prove that the source region of the Macigno sediment contained not only igneous but also rapidly exhuming crustal domains in Oligocene timesThe source region was characterized by metamorphic rocks from the zone around the Periadriatic intrusives, where extremely high geothermal gradients (von Blanckenburg and Davies 1995) reset both the mica Ar–Ar and the zircon FT thermochronometers over huge volumes of crustal material in Middle Oligocene times
The source region was characterized by metamorphic rocks from the zone around the Periadriatic intrusives, where extremely high geothermal gradients (von Blanckenburg and Davies 1995) reset both the mica Ar–Ar and the zircon FT thermochronometers over huge volumes of crustal material in Middle Oligocene timesThe modern surface of the Western Alps contains zones where the zircon FT ages are around and slightly younger than 30 Ma: (a) the Sesia-Lanzo zone and the Gran Paradiso Massif (Hurford et al
These areas together with the former cover of these blocks are the most probable sources of the siliciclastic material of the Macigno Formation carrying zircons of Paleogene FT agesThe means of these Tertiary age clusters from the Macigno sandstone preceded the sedimentation by only 4–10 Ma, using an average 24 Ma depositional age (cf
Deep erosion since the Oligocene (in the range of 2 km according to Kuhlemann 2000) completely removed the volume of Paleogene FT ages until recent timesThus, the central part of the Lepontine dome now shows only Middle or even Late Miocene zircon FT ages (Hunziker et al
Thus, the central part of the Lepontine dome now shows only Middle or even Late Miocene zircon FT ages (Hunziker et al1992)
Some of these ages fall into the Cenozoic Era, but we refer to this age cluster as Late Cretaceous, because these cooling ages have a Late Cretaceous mean and reflect a cooling period that follow the Eo-Alpine (Cretaceous) metamorphic eventThis affected the Austroalpine realm, with a climax around 110–100 Ma
The Dent Blanche nappe is an exception, because the zircon FT ages in the recently exposed level show complete Oligocene reset (Fig11)
2000), and the higher levels of the preserved western remnants of the Austroapine nappe complex probably supplied zircon grains with Mesozoic FT ages, as also observed in the Swiss molasse foreland basin (Spiegel et al1999).
This is an ill-defined cluster of single-grain ages with a mean falling into the Late Jurassic (Fig7; Table 2)
They can be related to the thermal effect of Jurassic rifting in the course of opening of the Pennine ocean (Frisch 1979)The Austroalpine crystalline basement formed a passive continental margin at that time and underwent rift-shoulder heating
11), but we believe it continued westward before the episode of deep Neogene erosion (Frisch et al2000)
This broader extent is also suggested by gneiss pebbles of the South German–Upper Austrian Molasse with Late Jurassic zircon FT ages (Spiegel et al1999; Bru¨gel 1998).
The recently exhumed basement of the Southern Alps at some distance from the Periadriatic plutons also shows Mesozoic zircon FT ages (Bertotti et al1999; Vance 1999)
during the deposition of the Macigno Formation is unlikely, because deep erosion of the Southern Alps did not occur until the Miocene collision and back-thrusting (Gunzenhauser 1985; Scho¨nborn 1992)No major areas of the crystalline basement were exposed during late Oligocene times, if at all.
No major areas of the crystalline basement were exposed during late Oligocene times, if at all.The source units of the Macigno Formation can be identified according to the data presented above
Integrating sandstone petrology data with single-grain fission tracks results, and analysis of the morphology of detrital apatite and zircon crystals of the Macigno Formation, allows the provenance, paleogeology, and paleogeography of the Northern Apennines foreland basin during late Chattian to early Aquitanian times (25 to 23 Ma) to be better understood.Euhedral and slightly rounded apatite crystals with glass inclusions support airborne volcanigenic contributions and/or very short transport distances (from a nearly coeval volcanic sequence).
Most non volcanigenic zircon grains have Oligocene cooling ages, reflecting an actively exhuming crystalline source region with high cooling ratesThis agrees nicely with the sandstone petrology.
Moreover, Jurassic zircon FT ages indicate the presence of a specific Silvretta-type Austroalpine basement in the source area, without Eo-Alpine metamorphism and with only a mild thermal resetting in Jurassic timesThe decreasing contribution of the latter source towards the top of the Macigno sedimentary section records its progressive erosion during rapid uplift of the orogenic lid.
