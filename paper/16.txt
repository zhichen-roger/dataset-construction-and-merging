Detrital zircon age model of Ordovician Wenquan quartzite south of Lungmuco-Shuanghu Suture in the Qiangtang area, Tibet: Constraint on tectonic affinity and source regionsDONG ChunYan1*, LI Cai2, WAN YuSheng1, WANG Wei1, WU YanWang2, XIE HangQiang1 & LIU DunYi1
Early to Middle Ordovician strata, including Wenquan quartzite, occur widely in the Himalaya, Lhasa, and south Qiangtang blocksThe Wenquan quartzite occurs on the south side of the Lungmuco-Shuanghu Suture in the Qiangtang area, Tibet
Based on data obtained in this study and by others, the main conclusions are as follows: 1) Low-grade metamorphic sedimentary rocks are distributed extensively in the south of the Lungmuco-Shuanghu Suture and are Phanerozoic in age; 2) Pan-African and Grenville-Jinning tectono-thermal events were well developed in the source region of the Wenquan quartzite; 3) the source region shows crustal addition and recycling of different periods; 4) Wenquan quartzite was derived from the Gondwana metamorphic basement, suggesting that the Qiangtang block is a Gondwanan fragment.Gondwana, Tibetan Plateau, detrital zircon, SHRIMP dating, Hf isotope, Pan-African movement, Grenville-Jinning movement
Detrital zircon age model of Ordovician Wenquan quartzite south of Lungmuco-Shuanghu Suture in the Qiangtang area, Tibet: Constraint on tectonic affinity and source regionsSci China Earth Sci, 2011, 54: 1034–1042, doi: 10.1007/s11430-010-4166-x
Based on the geological and fossil records and geochronology of eclogites, blueschists, and ophiolites, the final collision of both the continents happened during the Triassic [1–7].Low-grade metamorphic strata are widely distributed in the south side of the Lungmuco-Shuanghu Suture
The upper portion of these contains abundant fossils, such as cephalopods, crinoids, graptolites and tentaculites, indicating deposition in the Middle Ordovician [2, 8, 9] (Figure 1)In the southern Himalaya area, Middle Ordovician conglomerate rests uncomfortably on metamorphic basement [10]
In the southern Himalaya area, Middle Ordovician conglomerate rests uncomfortably on metamorphic basement [10]In the western Nepal, Ordovician conglomerate is identified and many detrital zircons of 530–480 Ma were found in Ordovician-Devonian strata [11]
In the western Nepal, Ordovician conglomerate is identified and many detrital zircons of 530–480 Ma were found in Ordovician-Devonian strata [11]In the northern Himalaya area, Early Ordovician conglomerate has also been identified [12–14]
In the northern Himalaya area, Early Ordovician conglomerate has also been identified [12–14]Ordovician-Permian strata in southern Qiangtang, Gangdise, and northern Himalaya have the same sedimentary formation and biostratigraphic sequence
Ordovician-Permian strata in southern Qiangtang, Gangdise, and northern Himalaya have the same sedimentary formation and biostratigraphic sequenceThey are the oldest covers on metamorphic basement on the Tibetan plateau and are considered of Gondwanan affinity [14, 15].
However, it is covered comformably by Middle Ordovician-Devonian strata with abundant fossilsThe quartzite is provisionally named the Wenquan quartzite, and no similar stratigraphic unit has been discovered in Qiangtang and adjacent areas [2, 8, 9]
Most analyses are distributed along or near concordia, but late Neoarchean zircons commonly show strong lead loss, with upper and low intercept ages being ca2.5 Ga and ca
Combined with the presence of Middle Ordovician fossils in the strata over thequartzite, it supports the notion that the widely-distributed,
low-grade metamorphic sedimentary rocks in the south side of the Lungmuco-Shuanghu Suture are not Precambrian in formation age [8]The detrital zircons of the Wenquan quartzite show a large age variation, mainly concentrated in 520–700, ca
Similar age distribution patterns for detrital zircons have also been obtained for metamorphic sediments in the Qiangtang area [35, 36] and Ordovician and younger (meta-)sediments in Gomori, south Qiangtang and Himalaya (Zhu DC, personal communication) [37]These suggest that a huge source region provides abundant detritus for the covers
An earlier study considered that the low-grade metamorphic sedimentary rocks constitute the Proterozoic basement in the south side of the Lungmuco-Shuanghu Suture and the lower and upper parts of the basement are the crystalline “hard basement” and metasedimentary “soft basement” [48–50]However, the discovery of abundant fossils in the metamorphic rocks indicates that they formed during the Ordovician [51]
However, the discovery of abundant fossils in the metamorphic rocks indicates that they formed during the Ordovician [51]In the south Qiangtang area, the formation age of the basement is not clear because of overlaying of post-Ordovician sediments, but it is considered to be similar to the Himalaya and Lhasa blocks where the basement is of Pan-African character in terms of regional correlation [51]
In the south Qiangtang area, the formation age of the basement is not clear because of overlaying of post-Ordovician sediments, but it is considered to be similar to the Himalaya and Lhasa blocks where the basement is of Pan-African character in terms of regional correlation [51]The Pan-African tectono-thermal event is well developed in the pre-Ordovi- cian basement of Gondwana
It is notable that the detrital zircons of the Wenquan quartzite show an age peak of 625 Ma (Figure 4(b)), but the Paleozoic magma-metamorphic ages are 480–530 Ma in the India-Hymalaya-Lhasa blocks [15, 37,43, 44, 47], either earlier or later than the typical Pan-  African tectono-thermal event (520–570 Ma) [45]
In recent years, Grenville-Jinning tectono-magmatic events have increasingly been identified in the Pan-African basement of Himalayas, including: 1) many inherited zircons of 1064–1144 and 636–776 Ma in intrusive rocks along the Lhaqênsangrag-Kangmar uplift Belt [13], 2) gneissic granitoids of 835–869 Ma in the Kangmar area [43], 3) abundant 780–1100 Ma zircons obtained from the pre-Ordovician Namche Barwa Complex in the eastern Himalaya [47], 4) many zircons of 900–1200 Ma identified in the pre-    Ordovician Bhimphedi Group in the Himalaya area, western Nepal [37], 5) many inherited and detrital zircons in the Palaeozoic S-type granites and metamorphic sedimentary rock enclaves in the Kathmandu area, Nepal [45], and 6) many 800–1300 Ma detrital zircons in the gneisses of the metamorphic basement in the Eohimalayan area [11, 53]In the Pan-African basement of the Lhasa block, on the other hand, ages of 748–787 Ma have been obtained only for metamorphosed intrusive rocks distributed in the Nyainqêntanglha Group, western margin of Nam Co [54]
This is supported by the detrital zircon age distribution of Carboniferous-Cretaceous (meta-)sedimentary rocks in the Himalaya, Lhasa, and south Qiangtang blocks [55, 56].In the Wenquan quartzite there are some detrital zircons older than 1200 Ma
Most of the early Precambrian detrital zircons are probably formed as products of crustal recyclingThey cannot provide important information on where they were derived, because of wide distribution of rocks with these ages in the North China Craton, South China Platform, and India Craton
In the Pan- African basement of the Tibetan Plateau, abundant early Precambrian rocks and zircons have recently been discovered, with ages mainly between 1800–2000 and 2400–2700 Ma [11, 45, 53, 57], respectively, to which the early Precambrian detrital zircons of the Wenquan quartzite are similar in age distributionThe detrital and residual zircons of >3000 Ma have also been reported in the Pan-African basement, including a ca
It is evident that there are early Precambrian crustal materials in the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent areas.The Lhasa-south Qiangtang block and Western Australia are similar in zircon age distribution spectra
In Western Australia, Archaean rocks are widely distributed, meta- sediments in the Jack Hills contain some detrital zircons of >4000 Ma [59], tectono-thermal events of 650–500 Ma are widely identified [60], and detrital zircons of Ordovician and younger sedimentary rocks are similar in age distribution and Hf isotope composition to ones of the (meta-) sediments [61, 62], including the Wenquan quartzite, in the Lhasa-south Qiangtang blockThese may suggest that in the Ordovician, both the Lhasa-south Qiangtang block and Western Australia belonged to Gondwana, and the latter should be the source region for the Wenquan quartzite and other sediments in the Lhasa-south Qiangtang block
These may suggest that in the Ordovician, both the Lhasa-south Qiangtang block and Western Australia belonged to Gondwana, and the latter should be the source region for the Wenquan quartzite and other sediments in the Lhasa-south Qiangtang blockIt is still debatable whether the South China Platform was a part of Gondwana [63, 64]
The most robust youngest detrital zircon age from the Wenquan quartzite is 525 Ma, providing geochronological evidence for a post Precambrian age for the widely distributed low-grade metamorphic sedimentary rocks in the south of the Lungmuco-Shuanghu Suture in the Qiangtang areaThe age distribution model of the detrital zircons from the Wenquan quartzite suggests that significant Pan-African and Grenville-Jinning tectono-thermal events occurred in their source region, where there are also some continental materials of the early Precambrian
The age distribution model of the detrital zircons from the Wenquan quartzite suggests that significant Pan-African and Grenville-Jinning tectono-thermal events occurred in their source region, where there are also some continental materials of the early PrecambrianHf isotope compositions of detrital zircons indicate that crustal recycling and addition happened in the source regions during different periods
