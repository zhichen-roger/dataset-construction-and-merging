Along the entire east-west trending Himalaya, Paleogene-Neogene foreland basin sediments are exposed along the southern margin of the mountain frontThis sequence has been used to study the rate of sedimentation and exhumation history of the source region, climatic changes, paleogeography and also for provenance analysis
The isotopic investigation (Robinson et al., 2001; Huyghe et al., 2005) pinpoint the two major changes in sedimentary fill in the Neogene foreland basin at 9.5 Ma by the abrupt increase of the ƐNd (0), possibly due to local exhumation of the Lesser Himalaya by the emplacement of Ramgarh Thrust (RT)The facies analysis classify the Siwalik Group into seven facies association (KFA1– KFA7) in which the fluvial system changes from meandering to gravelly braided river system (Tokuoka et al., 1990; Nakayama and Ulak, 1999; Huyghe et al., 2005; Sigdel, 2013)
Geochronological investigations in Nepal Himalaya have revealed that the foreland basin sediments were derived from the Higher and Lesser Himalayas since late Cenozoic (DeCelles et al., 1998a, 1998b, 2000, 2001, 2004; Najman et al., 2005; Baral et al., 2015)In Nepal Himalaya, the majority of these provenance studies focused on the Paleogene sequence (DeCelles et al., 1998b, 2004, 2014; Najman et al., 2005; Gehrels et al., 2011)
In Nepal Himalaya, the majority of these provenance studies focused on the Paleogene sequence (DeCelles et al., 1998b, 2004, 2014; Najman et al., 2005; Gehrels et al., 2011)However, a few studies were carried out within the Neogene Siwalik Group and most of them are concentrated on some portion of the Siwalik Group (Critelli and Ingersoll, 1994; DeCelles et al., 1998a; Szulc et al., 2006; Baral et al., 2015)
However, a few studies were carried out within the Neogene Siwalik Group and most of them are concentrated on some portion of the Siwalik Group (Critelli and Ingersoll, 1994; DeCelles et al., 1998a; Szulc et al., 2006; Baral et al., 2015)Therefore, in the present study, we have selected the Siwalik Group exposed along the Karnali River section, which is magneto-stratigraphically dated in detail (Gautam and Fujiwara, 2000)
We applied detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology together with sandstone petrography for better interpretation of the provenance during middle Miocene to early Pleistocene period.The Himalaya range, a typical continent-continent collision zone between the Indian and Eurasian plates (Gansser, 1964; Patriat and Achache, 1984), represents the youngest collision orogeny of the early Eocene time (55–50 Ma)(Yin and Harrison, 2000)
The Himalaya range, a typical continent-continent collision zone between the Indian and Eurasian plates (Gansser, 1964; Patriat and Achache, 1984), represents the youngest collision orogeny of the early Eocene time (55–50 Ma)(Yin and Harrison, 2000)It extends for about 2400 km from the Nanga Parbat in the west to the Namche Barwa in the east
The Indo-Gangetic Plain is a flat area at the southernmost part of the Himalaya and is covered by Quaternary depositsThe northernmost TH is comprised of Cambrian to Late-Cretaceous fossiliferous sedimentary rocks, although few metamorphic rocks occur near the boundary with the Higher Himalaya and younger Eocene rocks in Tibet
The northernmost TH is comprised of Cambrian to Late-Cretaceous fossiliferous sedimentary rocks, although few metamorphic rocks occur near the boundary with the Higher Himalaya and younger Eocene rocks in TibetThe TH extends from the Indus-Yarlung Suture Zone (IYSZ), the collision zone of the Indian and Eurasian plates (Le Fort, 1975) in the north, to South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS) in the south
The Lower Lesser Himalaya (LLH) is Precambrian in age, with rocks ranging from Paleoproterozoic (1800–2000 Ma) to late Neoproterozoic (540 Ma) (Valdiya, 1995, 1998; Parrish and Hodges, 1996)The upper Lesser Himalaya (ULH) comprises Permo-Carboniferous, (Gondwana) sedimentary units below and the early Cretaceous to Eocene marine rocks (Sakai, 1983) above
The upper Lesser Himalaya (ULH) comprises Permo-Carboniferous, (Gondwana) sedimentary units below and the early Cretaceous to Eocene marine rocks (Sakai, 1983) aboveThe Eocene marine sediments of the Bhainskati Formation marked by an oxisol layer, are overlain by the lower to middle Miocene (or Oligocene to early Miocene) fluvial sediments of the Dumri Formation (Sakai, 1983; DeCelles et al., 2004)
The Eocene marine sediments of the Bhainskati Formation marked by an oxisol layer, are overlain by the lower to middle Miocene (or Oligocene to early Miocene) fluvial sediments of the Dumri Formation (Sakai, 1983; DeCelles et al., 2004)The Dumri Formation is the youngest strata within the LH, represents the first foreland basin sediment derived from the uprising Himalaya
For example, the Eocene Bhainskati Formation is thrusted over the Miocene Dumri FormationThe LH thrusted over the Siwalik Group, which represents the Neogene foreland basin sequence of the Himalaya
The LH thrusted over the Siwalik Group, which represents the Neogene foreland basin sequence of the HimalayaThe Siwalik Group consists of about 6 km thick coarsening upward Neogene fluvial sediments that extend from the MBT to Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT) towards south (Gansser, 1964; Tokuoka et al., 1990; Gautam, 2008)
The Siwalik Group consists of about 6 km thick coarsening upward Neogene fluvial sediments that extend from the MBT to Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT) towards south (Gansser, 1964; Tokuoka et al., 1990; Gautam, 2008)Further to the south is the Quaternary fluvial deposit called as IndoGangetic Plain sediments.
Further to the south is the Quaternary fluvial deposit called as IndoGangetic Plain sediments.Geological setting of the Siwalik Group in Nepal Himalaya
The Siwalik Group, deposited during middle Miocene to early Pleistocene, is well-exposed along the southern hills of the Himalaya in various locations particularly along the major river sections (Dhital, 2015)The Siwalik foreland basin is one of the largest foreland basins on Earth (Szulc et al., 2006 and reference therein)
Study on oxygen isotope (d18O) of fresh water bivalve shells and mammal teeth shows that seasonal variability in surface water remained unchanged during the late Miocene and Pliocene time (Dettman et al., 2001)The sediment accumulation rate is between 32 and 50 cm kyr1 for the 10.8 Myr time span (Gautam and Fujiwara, 2000) at Karnali Section and Surai Khola section (230 km eastward, Fig
Additionally, few subordinate peaks of Paleoand Mesoproterozoic age are also present (Fig6)
The detrital sediments in the Paleogene foreland basin are derived from the Lhasa Terrane, Gangdese batholiths, Indus-Tsangpo suture zone, ultra-high pressure gneiss Terrane and Tethys Himalaya until the Early Miocene time (Najman et al., 2004, 2009)And after that, the Lesser Himalaya, Higher Himalaya and Tethys Himalaya successively acted as the sources of sediments for the Tertiary foreland basin (DeCelles et al., 1998a, 1998b, 2000, 2004; Ravikant et al., 2011)
The Gangdese batholith, located north of the Himalayan belt, is of Cretaceous–early Tertiary (50–85 Ma) age (Yin and Harrison, 2000)In the current study, none of the grains in the Lower Siwalik Group are younger than the Permian age, which suggests that the Himalayan belt had already formed a relief capable of blocking the sediments of Asian affinity by the time of deposition of Lower Siwalik.
In the current study, none of the grains in the Lower Siwalik Group are younger than the Permian age, which suggests that the Himalayan belt had already formed a relief capable of blocking the sediments of Asian affinity by the time of deposition of Lower Siwalik.The Middle Siwalik (late Miocene to early Pliocene; maximum deposition age 10–8.3 Ma and minimum age 4.5 Ma; Gautam and Fujiwara, 2000, and Table 1 of present study) samples also validate the mixed type of source as the Lower Siwalik
The Middle Siwalik (late Miocene to early Pliocene; maximum deposition age 10–8.3 Ma and minimum age 4.5 Ma; Gautam and Fujiwara, 2000, and Table 1 of present study) samples also validate the mixed type of source as the Lower SiwalikThe highest number of grains clusters between Cambrian- Late Carboniferous with a peak age at 470 Ma, pointing the dominant source to be the Tethys and upper Lesser Himalaya
The highest number of grains clusters between Cambrian- Late Carboniferous with a peak age at 470 Ma, pointing the dominant source to be the Tethys and upper Lesser HimalayaThe occurrence of the detrital zircons of <500 Ma is higher in the Middle Siwalik than in Lower Siwalik (Figs
The Paleoproterozoic detrital grains are more abundant in the Middle than in the Lower Siwalik Group, emphasizing the increase of source materials from the lower Lesser Himalaya by the time of Middle Siwalik depositionThe two thrust MBT and RT in western Nepal were activated at 10 and 11 Ma that causes the exhumation andm denudation of the Lesser Himalayan Duplex in western Nepal and deposited in Middle Siwalik
The recorded youngest grain of 35 Ma is the remnant of the Eocene Himalayan metamorphic/thermal event in the Higher Himalayan Crystalline (Catlos et al., 2002)These age distribution patterns are identical with the age of the Himalaya described by several studies that demonstrate the mixed type of source from the northern Himalaya (Parrish and Hodges, 1996; DeCelles et al., 2000; Richards et al., 2005; Kohn et al., 2010; Gehrels et al., 2011; Baral et al., 2015)
The absence of Cenozoic grains suggests that no granitic body was eroded in those areasThe paleocurrent study also shows that the dominant flow direction was southwest and southeast, indicating the northern Himalaya as a source of detritus in Siwalik Group (Huyghe et al., 2005)
The U-Pb data show that the mid-Proterozoic detrital zircon grains increased during the time of deposition of Middle SiwalikBoth these findings point out that the Lesser Himalaya exhumed rapidly around 10 Ma
Late Mesoproterozoic (1000 Ma) grains are higher in number in the Lower Siwalik than in Middle Siwalik pointing to the possibility that the exhumation of the Higher Himalaya was slowSuch inference is supported by the presence of significant numbers of the detrital zircons grains with dates (1000 to <500 Ma) resembling the age of Tethys and upper Lesser Himalayan rock (Mesoproterozoic to Cambrian)
Such inference is supported by the presence of significant numbers of the detrital zircons grains with dates (1000 to <500 Ma) resembling the age of Tethys and upper Lesser Himalayan rock (Mesoproterozoic to Cambrian)Due to the similar age distribution of the Tethys Himalaya, upper Lesser Himalaya, and Higher Himalaya, it is challenging to pinpoint the particular source region
However, the Tethys, Higher, and Lesser Himalayas together acted as a continuous source during the NeogeneThe sandstone composition (litharenite and sub-litharenite) suggests that the sediments were reworked and recycled in the hinterland Himalayan orogen.
