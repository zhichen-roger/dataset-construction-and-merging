metric transverse ridge that was composed of structurally isolated blocks of heterogeneously aged Paleogene source crust, which provided the source for Macquarie Island’s gabbroic sedimentary lithofacies.Voluminous sedimentary sequences, up to 100 m thick, deposited within spreading-ridge basins (Karson et al., 1984) have the potential to record the genesis and exhumation of the lower oceanic crust as is commonly described in continental basins fl anking metamorphic core complexes (e.g., Dunkl et al., 1998; Wagner and Johnson, 2006)

(half rates of 4.4–28 mm/yr) separated the IndoAustralian and Pacifi c plates from the middle Eocene to late Miocene and was characterized by very short spreading corridors with longoffset transforms (>100 km) during formation of Macquarie Island crust (Massell et al., 2000; Varne et al., 2000; Mosher and Massell-Symons, 2008)The majority of rocks exposed on the island consist of enriched mid-ocean-ridge basalt (E-MORB) pillows (Kamenetsky and Maas, 2002) and, to a lesser extent, lower-crustal rocks including sheeted diabase dikes, gabbro, and serpentinized harzburgite (Goscombe and Everard, 1998)

The older ages and unusual geochemistry of the detrital zircon and clinopyroxene populations, respectively, exclude Miocene-aged igneous crust formed at the proto–Macquarie spreading ridge as a signifi cant source for the gabbroic sedimentary intervalsAny likely provenance must have contained mixed-aged crust that was not only older, but also geochemically different from the interbedded volcanic rocks of Macquarie Island.

Initial development of Neogene volcano-sedimentary basins within the westernmost active proto–Macquarie spreading ridge corridor is preserved by locally derived, very coarse-grained basaltic breccias that typically occur adjacent to spreading-related faultsThese spreading-related faults accommodated extension during volcanism in the active proto–Macquarie spreading ridge and long after volcanism ceased
