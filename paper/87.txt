U-Pb ages of detrital zircons in lower Permian sandstone and siltstone of the Permian Basin, west Texas, USA: Evidence of dominant Gondwanan and peri-Gondwanan sediment input to Laurentia1Department of Geological Sciences, Jackson School of Geosciences, University of Texas at Austin, 2275 Speedway C9000, Austin,  Texas 78712, USA
The Permian Basin of west Texas, one of the most economically significant hydrocarbon basins in the United States, formed along the southwest margin of Laurentia in the foreland of the Ouachita-Marathon orogen during the late PaleozoicWhile its stratigraphic record temporally coincides with syn- and post-orogenic Ouachita-Marathon sedimentation, sediment provenance, sediment routing and dispersal, and paleo-drainage evolution have remained controversial
This study presents more than 2000 new detrital zircon U-Pb ages from 16 samples across the Permian Basin to elucidate early Permian sediment provenance and basin-fill evolutionThe data show that Wolfcampian sandstones are dominated by 950–1070 Ma and 500–700 Ma detrital zircon U-Pb ages, whereas Leonardian sandstones and siltstones are dominated by 500–700 Ma and 280–480 Ma detrital zircon U-Pb ages
Regional comparison of these new detrital zircon results with published data from Carboniferous and Permian sedimentary rocks in various terranes of Mexico and Central America, Appalachian foreland basins, Ouachita orogenic belt, midcontinent of United States, and Fort Worth Basin (Texas), indicates that most sediment influx to the Permian Basin during the earlyPermian (Wolfcampian and Leonardian) was derived from basement or recycled upper Paleozoic strata associated with Gondwanan and peri-Gondwanan terranes in modern Mexico and Central America
Permian (Wolfcampian and Leonardian) was derived from basement or recycled upper Paleozoic strata associated with Gondwanan and peri-Gondwanan terranes in modern Mexico and Central AmericaNorth American basements such as the Appalachian Grenville (950–1300 Ma), Granite-Rhyolite (1300–1500 Ma), and Yavapai-Mazatzal (1600–1800 Ma) provinces, appear to have provided only minor amounts of sediment
Lower Permian (272–299 Ma) strata in the Permian Basin form economically important conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs in shelf and deep-water depositional settingsWhile previous studies have focused mainly on depositional systems and lithofacies analysis (Handford, 1981; Hamlin, 2009; Hamlin and Baumgardner, 2012), the sedimentary provenance and paleogeographic evolution of this complex and long-lived basin system at the southwestern margin of Laurentia have remained poorly understood and controversial
Despite competing models for the tectonic and fill history of the Permian Basin, no detrital zircon U-Pb data have been published specifically addressing the provenance of lower Permian strataDetrital zircon age data from the middle Permian (Guadalupian, 260–272 Ma) Delaware Mountain Group in the middle and north of Delaware Basin suggest that recycled Appalachian detritus and/or terranes in Mexico and Central America might represent possible source areas (Soreghan and Soreghan, 2013; Xie et al., 2018a)
Detrital zircon age data from the middle Permian (Guadalupian, 260–272 Ma) Delaware Mountain Group in the middle and north of Delaware Basin suggest that recycled Appalachian detritus and/or terranes in Mexico and Central America might represent possible source areas (Soreghan and Soreghan, 2013; Xie et al., 2018a)However, sediment provenance could vary significantly in different parts of the complexly partitioned Permian Basin that are possibly fed by different paleo-drainage systems from different source areas
However, sediment provenance could vary significantly in different parts of the complexly partitioned Permian Basin that are possibly fed by different paleo-drainage systems from different source areasExisting provenance data for the Permian Basin are inadequate to characterize possible provenance variations across the basin in the lower Permian (272–299 Ma) strata and also do not allow for regional provenance comparisons and the assessment of potential source regions.
Existing provenance data for the Permian Basin are inadequate to characterize possible provenance variations across the basin in the lower Permian (272–299 Ma) strata and also do not allow for regional provenance comparisons and the assessment of potential source regions.Provenance data for Mississippian to Jurassic strata in western North America have painted a picture of transcontinental fluvial drainage systems delivering sediment westward from the Appalachian orogenic belt (Dickinson and Gehrels, 2003; Dickinson and Gehrels, 2010; Gehrels et al., 2011), mainly on the basis of the presence of Mesoproterozoic (1000–1350 Ma) and Paleozoic detrital zircon U-Pb ages derived from three major belts in the eastern North America related to the Taconic (ca

In the northern Permian Basin, Mesoproterozoic detrital zircon ages (1000–1350 Ma) in the Guadalupian Delaware Mountain Group were interpreted to be derived from recycled Appalachian/Ouachita detritus transported by fluvial and eolian systems (Soreghan and Soreghan, 2013; Xie et al., 2018a)Similar detrital zircon ages from Carboniferous strata in the Marathon Basin, along the Ouachita/Marathon thrust front in west Texas, were also interpreted to be ultimately sourced from the Appalachians through major axial fluvial transport systems (Gleason et al., 2007)
Similar detrital zircon ages from Carboniferous strata in the Marathon Basin, along the Ouachita/Marathon thrust front in west Texas, were also interpreted to be ultimately sourced from the Appalachians through major axial fluvial transport systems (Gleason et al., 2007)While detailed sediment dispersal models for Early and Middle Pennsylvanian times were proposed (Kissock et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2018b), they might not be applicable for the Permian given the collisional tectonic evolution of southwestern Laurentia during this time interval
While detailed sediment dispersal models for Early and Middle Pennsylvanian times were proposed (Kissock et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2018b), they might not be applicable for the Permian given the collisional tectonic evolution of southwestern Laurentia during this time intervalThomas (2011a) noted that this transcontinental fluvial model is spatially and temporally oversimplified for the following reasons

The increasing diversity of age component suggests a more tectonic-related labile drainage system during late PaleozoicSecond, in terms of spatial changes, Thomas (2011a) found a mismatch in the detrital zircon U-Pb signatures for Permian strata between the Grand Canyon and Appalachian foreland basins in terms of 700–250 Ma age components
Second, in terms of spatial changes, Thomas (2011a) found a mismatch in the detrital zircon U-Pb signatures for Permian strata between the Grand Canyon and Appalachian foreland basins in terms of 700–250 Ma age componentsThese discoveries suggested the development of additional sources or expanding drainage systems during the late Paleozoic
These discoveries suggested the development of additional sources or expanding drainage systems during the late PaleozoicMore importantly, recent studies documented significant input of Gondwanan and peri-Gondwanan-derived zircons in late Paleozoic strata in southwestern Laurentia (Gleason et al., 2007; Soreghan and Soreghan, 2013; Xie et al., 2018a), implying that previous provenance interpretations may have not recognized the input from the Gondwanan and peri-Gondwanan terranes of Mexico and Central America
More importantly, recent studies documented significant input of Gondwanan and peri-Gondwanan-derived zircons in late Paleozoic strata in southwestern Laurentia (Gleason et al., 2007; Soreghan and Soreghan, 2013; Xie et al., 2018a), implying that previous provenance interpretations may have not recognized the input from the Gondwanan and peri-Gondwanan terranes of Mexico and Central AmericaThe recognition of possible southern sources has been dramatically aided by the characterization of different sources from Gondwanan and peri-Gondwanan terranes in Mexico and Central America (Yañez et al., 1991; Ortega-Gutierrez et al., 1995; Steiner and Walker, 1996; Sánchez-Zavala et al., 1999; Stewart et al., 1999; Torres et al., 1999; Keppie et al., 2001; Solari et al., 2003; Keppie et al., 2004; Gillis et al., 2005; Weber et al., 2006; Weber et al., 2008; Weber et al., 2009; Martens et al., 2010; Kirsch et al., 2012).
In this study, detrital zircon U-Pb age data are reported for 16 samples collected from lower Permian strata from the Permian Basin, including the Northern Shelf, Central Basin Platform, and Midland, Val Verde, and Delaware basins to characterize its provenance signaturesThese new detrital zircon U-Pb data are compared to regional detrital zircon data published ranging from upper Paleozoic strata in the Appalachian foreland clastic wedges to terranes in Mexico and Central America to reconstruct sediment sourcing, paleo-dispersal patterns, and paleogeography

Finally, combined with the regional tectonism, we elucidate the provenance shift within the lower to middle Permian intervals (260–299 Ma) in the Permian Basin.The Permian Basin is comprised of two major deep-water sub-basins—the Midland Basin in the east and the Delaware Basin in the west—that are separated by the Central Basin Platform
The Permian Basin is comprised of two major deep-water sub-basins—the Midland Basin in the east and the Delaware Basin in the west—that are separated by the Central Basin PlatformIt is bounded by the MarathonOuachita fold and thrust belt in the south and carbonate platforms along the Diablo Platforms, Northwest and Northern Shelf, and the Eastern Shelf along the western, northern, and eastern margins, respectively (Fig
The late Paleozoic Marathon-Ouachita orogenic belt formed along the southern Neoproterozoic rift margin of Laurentia in response to south-directed subduction of the Rheic Ocean and eventual continental collision, leading to the formation of the supercontinent PangeaThis resulted in the  inversion of the Laurentian Neoproterozoic rifted and early Paleozoic passive continental margin and the formation of the Marathon foldand-thrust belt and its associated flexural foreland basin (Viele and Thomas, 1989)

During the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian, large continental ice sheets covered the polar region of Gondwana (Crowell, 1978, 1995; Rygel et al., 2008), although Montañez and Poulsen (2013) argued that not all ice sheets were continental, resulting in high-frequency and largeamplitude glacio-eustatic sea-level fluctuationsThe lower Permian (Wolfcampian, ca
The lower Permian (Wolfcampian, ca280– 299 Ma, and Leonardian, ca
272–280 Ma) marked the paleoclimatic transition from Pennsylvanian icehouse to late Permian (ca252– 260 Ma) greenhouse conditions (Ruppel and Ward, 2013)
Amplitudes of eustatic sea-level variations during the Pennsylvanian were significantly higher than those during the warmer late Permian (Rygel et al., 2008).For this study, 16 samples were collected and analyzed for detrital zircon U-Pb provenance analysis
Based on the correlation of Permian Basin fusulinid zones (Ross, 1962; Ross, 1963; Wilde, 1990) with lithostratigraphic units (Baumgardner et al., 2016a), we estimate the depositional ages of each formation in this studyThe depositional age of the Wolfcamp C Formation is ca
The Permian interval is characterized by reciprocal siliciclastic and carbonate depositional systems in the shallow marine and deep water settingWolfcamp C Formation (sample W1 to W7) consists of fine- to medium-grained sandstone sourced from deep water channellobe complexes fed by westward progradation of fluvial and deltaic systems from the Eastern Shelf (Wright, 2011)
In contrast, the Tubb Formation (samples L1 to L3) was deposited on the carbonate platforms of Permian Basin as an example of reciprocal siliciclastic- carbonate sedimentation (Mazzullo, 1982)The Tubb Formation is composed of siltstone to very fine-grained sandstone, anhydrite shale, and dolomite deposited in a complex of eolian, desert-fluvial, peritidal, and nearshore-marine environment in an arid-climatic setting (Silver and Todd, 1969)
The entire Permian Basin stratigraphy and sampled intervals are summarized in Figure 2 and formation names, lithologies, stratigraphic stages, basin settings, and locations of each sample are catalogued in Table 1.Detrital zircon grains were separated, from ~1.0 to 1.5 kg of core samples, using traditional heavy mineral separation methods, including crushing and grinding, Gemini water table concentration, bromoform and methyl iodide heavy liquid separations, and hand magnet and Frantz magnetic susceptibility separations

As the Permian Basin likely received sediment from different basement terranes in both Laurentia and Gondwana, this study considered Laurentian, peri-Gondwanan, and Gondwanan source signatures for the evaluation of the new detrital zircon U-Pb provenance data.The detrital zircon U-Pb results are displayed as kernel density estimate (KDE) (Vermeesch, 2012) diagrams and histograms (Fig

A fundamental question for the Permian Basin is the source of its clastic sediment and the tectonic drivers for its provenance evolutionUnlike the Paleozoic strata in western Laurentia, which are dominated by sedimentary input derived from the Granite-Rhyolite (1300– 1500 Ma) (Bickford et al., 1986; Van Schmus

Group A (260–350 Ma) zircons are probably related to Carboniferous to Permian arc magmatism in various terranes of Mexico (Torres et al., 1999; Dickinson and Lawton, 2001; Kirsch et al., 2012) (Fig8)
Arc-related magmatic and sedimentary sequences of Carboniferous to Permian age have been documented in various tectonostratigraphic terranes of Mexico (Handschy and Dyer, 1987; Yañez et al., 1991; Stewart et al., 1999; Torres et al., 1999; Solari et al., 2001; Elías-Herrera and Ortega-Gutiérrez, 2002; Ducea et al., 2004; Keppie et al., 2004; Rosales-Lagarde et al., 2005; Weber et al., 2007; Riggs et al., 2010; Kirsch et al., 2012)Carboniferous (300–350 Ma) detrital zircons likely derived from sparse magmatism related to Iapetus closure and Gondwana-Laurentia collision, as documented from the Coahuila and Mixtecan terranes (Yañez et al., 1991; Cameron et al., 1992; Lopez, 1997; Stewart et al., 1999;  Weber et al., 2007)
Carboniferous (300–350 Ma) detrital zircons likely derived from sparse magmatism related to Iapetus closure and Gondwana-Laurentia collision, as documented from the Coahuila and Mixtecan terranes (Yañez et al., 1991; Cameron et al., 1992; Lopez, 1997; Stewart et al., 1999;  Weber et al., 2007)There is widespread evidence for arc magmatism in southern and eastern Mexico during deposition of Leonardian strata (280–272 Ma) (Torres et al., 1999; Dickinson and Lawton, 2001; Elías-Herrera and OrtegaGutiérrez, 2002; Ducea et al., 2004; Weber et al., 2007; Ortega-Flores et al., 2014; CentenoGarcía, 2017).

(2017) also reported Neoproterozoic detrital zircon ages from Lower-Middle Pennsylvanian strata in the basins in North American midcontinentHowever, detailed evaluation of published detrital zircon data from upper Paleozoic strata in Appalachian foreland basins (Thomas et al., 2004; Becker et al., 2005) demonstrates that only very few zircons from the Appalachian foreland clastic wedges fall into Group C (500–850 Ma)
However, detailed evaluation of published detrital zircon data from upper Paleozoic strata in Appalachian foreland basins (Thomas et al., 2004; Becker et al., 2005) demonstrates that only very few zircons from the Appalachian foreland clastic wedges fall into Group C (500–850 Ma)In contrast, more than 50 percent of detrital zircon ages from the Santa Rosa Formation are identical to Group C detrital zircon ages (Weber et al., 2006; Weber et al., 2009), strongly suggesting derivation from recycled Paleozoic strata of the YucatanMaya terrane
In contrast, more than 50 percent of detrital zircon ages from the Santa Rosa Formation are identical to Group C detrital zircon ages (Weber et al., 2006; Weber et al., 2009), strongly suggesting derivation from recycled Paleozoic strata of the YucatanMaya terraneAlternatively, 530–539 Ma detrital zircons could also be recycled from late Neoproterozoic and Cambrian volcanics along the southern Laurentian margin, related to Rodinia rifting and break-up, including the Oklahoma Aulacogen, USA (Thomas, 2011b)
Alternatively, 530–539 Ma detrital zircons could also be recycled from late Neoproterozoic and Cambrian volcanics along the southern Laurentian margin, related to Rodinia rifting and break-up, including the Oklahoma Aulacogen, USA (Thomas, 2011b)This no-

Data of Pennsylvanian sandstones in Fort Worth Basin are from Alsalem et al(2017)
Data of Mississippian sandstones in Ouachita orogenic belt are from McGuire (2017).Group E detrital zircon ages (1300–1600 Ma) are most likely derived from the Granite-  Rhyolite Province (1300–1500 Ma) of the midcontinent (Bickford et al., 1986) and have been shown to be dominant in Leonardian strata in the Ancestral Rocky Mountains, such as the Paradox Basin (Lawton et al., 2015)
Although the distance from the midcontinent basement province to the Permian Basin is short, only 9 percent and 7 percent of detrital zircon ages in Wolfcampian and Leonardian samples, respectively, could be derived from this sourceThis is likely attributable to the fact that Granite-Rhyolite Province rocks were mostly buried in the midcontinent region and only exposed and eroded in local Ancestral Rocky Mountains basement uplifts.
These detrital zircon ages of this dual Laurentian signature are abundant in the Upper Pennsylvanian and lower Permian strata in the Bravo Dome and Paradox Basin (Soreghan et al., 2002; Lawton et al., 2015).However, Group F detrital zircon ages (1600– 1800 Ma), similar to Group E detrital zircon ages (1300–1600 Ma), form only a minor provenance component, accounting for 6 percent and 5 percent of all zircons from Wolfcampian and Leonardian samples, respectively.
First, 1.85 Ga detrital zircon ages have also been reported from the upper Paleozoic Las Delicias Formation in the Coahuila terrane and interpreted to have been originally sourced from the Ventuari-Tapajor province (Lopez et al., 2001)Second, detrital zircons in the Mississippian Santa Rosa Formation in the Yucatan-Maya
Second, detrital zircons in the Mississippian Santa Rosa Formation in the Yucatan-Mayaterrane also show Group G detrital zircon ages (1800–2300 Ma) that are thought to have been derived from the Trans-Amazonian province (Weber et al., 2009).
Early Paleoproterozoic and Archean detrital zircon ages compose only a subordinate proportion (4 percent–6 percent) in both Wolfcampian and Leonardian samplesThese detrital zircon age components are likely derived from Archean basements in the northern United States and the Canadian Shield region in the interior of the Laurentian craton (Laskowski et al., 2013).
These detrital zircon age components are likely derived from Archean basements in the northern United States and the Canadian Shield region in the interior of the Laurentian craton (Laskowski et al., 2013).Three distinct core-rim age clusters are observed in Wolfcampian samples (Fig

Because detrital zircons with Pan-African ages are commonly reported in late Paleozoic strata in Mexico and Central America (Krogh et al., 1993; Lopez et al., 2001; Keppie et al., 2006; Weber et al., 2006; Weber et al., 2007; Martens et al., 2010) but very few are reported in late Paleozoic clastic wedges of Appalachian foreland (Thomas et al., 2004; Becker et al., 2006; Park et al., 2010), WC3 core-rim age pairs suggest the Mexican and Central American source.Lastly, one significant detrital zircon age cluster for Leonardian samples is characterized by 280–770 Ma rims and 340–2000 Ma cores (LC1 in Fig
In order to critically assess sediment provenance for each detrital zircon age group, our new detrital zircon U-Pb data were integrated with the existing age data from the Guadalupian Delaware Mountain Group in the Permian Basin (Fig9A) to compare the overall provenance signatures from two possible source regions— eastern U.S

Group A (260–350 Ma) zircons are found in Leonardian and Guadalupian samplesUpper Paleozoic sediment in Mexican terranes also contained significant numbers of Group A detrital zircons
Upper Paleozoic sediment in Mexican terranes also contained significant numbers of Group A detrital zirconsThe source of these Group A zircons is likely found in the Permian and Carboniferous arcs of Mexico.
The source of these Group A zircons is likely found in the Permian and Carboniferous arcs of Mexico.Group B (350–500 Ma) detrital zircons are found in all samples in this study, but relatively under-represented in Wolfcampian samples
In Wolfcampian, Leonardian, and Guadalupian samples, Group B detrital zircons show age peaks at 411, 421, 430, 434, and 467 MaSimilar Silurian and Ordovician detrital zircon age peaks are found in both Appalachian (416, 454 Ma) and Mexican terranes (411, 462 Ma) and provide no diagnostic clue as to the provenance of Group B zircons in Permian strata
Similar Silurian and Ordovician detrital zircon age peaks are found in both Appalachian (416, 454 Ma) and Mexican terranes (411, 462 Ma) and provide no diagnostic clue as to the provenance of Group B zircons in Permian strataHowever, given the comparison of euhedral zircons in Leonardian samples with Maya basement ages (Krogh et al., 1993; Steiner and Walker, 1996; Martens et al., 2010), it appears reasonable to say that at least some of the Group B zircons were derived from Gondwanan and/or peri-Gondwanan terranes of Mexico and Central America, such as the Maya terrane.
Group C (500–850 Ma) detrital zircons are dominant in all Leonardian and Wolfcampian samples, but relatively rare in Guadalupian samplesGroup C zircons in Mexican strata show three distinct age peaks at 541, 594, and 625 Ma
Note that Permian Basin samples from each stage have an age peak close to ca541 Ma
An alternative source interpretation for parts of Group C detrital zircons might be Cambrian synrift volcanic rocks from southern Oklahoma (530–539 Ma).Group D (850–1300 Ma) detrital zircons are dominant in Guadalupian and Wolfcampian samples and relatively underrepresented in Leonardian samples of the Permian Basin
Group D (850–1300 Ma) detrital zircons are dominant in Guadalupian and Wolfcampian samples and relatively underrepresented in Leonardian samples of the Permian BasinFor Wolfcampian samples, one detrital zircon age peak is 998 Ma, which is close to the 1008 Ma age peak in Mexican terranes, and an age peak is 1052 Ma, which is close to the 1048 Ma peak in Appalachian foreland strata
However, Group D ages in the Guadalupian samples are very similar to those in Appalachian samples.In order to assess Permian Basin provenance in a regional and super-regional context, we also compiled detrital zircon data from late Paleozoic sedimentary rocks in Fort Worth Basin, Ouachita foredeep, Appalachian foreland, midcontinent, and several Gondwanan/ peri-Gondwanan terranes in Mexico (Fig

Lower Permian metasedimentary rock and Carboniferous Santa Rosa Formation in the Chiapas Massif Complex of the Maya terranes in southeastern Mexico, show detrital zircon age spectra similar to those of Wolfcampian and Leonardian samples (Fig9C)
In particular, major Group C detrital zircon age peaks (538, 542, 591, 596, and 624 Ma) of Permian Basin samples show the most similarity with age peaks (543, 551, 593, 595, 626, and 632 Ma) of metasedimentary rock and Santa Rosa Formation samples in the Chiapas Massif ComplexAdditionally, Silurian age peaks (411, 421, 430, and 434 Ma) and Mesoproterozoic age peaks (998, 1027, 1045, and 1182 Ma) in the Permian Basin samples also appear to be correlated with age peaks found in upper Paleozoic samples in Mexico
Additionally, Silurian age peaks (411, 421, 430, and 434 Ma) and Mesoproterozoic age peaks (998, 1027, 1045, and 1182 Ma) in the Permian Basin samples also appear to be correlated with age peaks found in upper Paleozoic samples in MexicoThese near-identical age peaks suggest the possibility that the lower Permian strata in the Permian Basin could at least in part be sourced from recycled upper Paleozoic sequences in Mexico.
These near-identical age peaks suggest the possibility that the lower Permian strata in the Permian Basin could at least in part be sourced from recycled upper Paleozoic sequences in Mexico.It is interesting to note that Group C (500– 850 Ma) detrital zircons have also been described from Pennsylvanian sandstone in the midcontinent (Fig
It is interesting to note that Group C (500– 850 Ma) detrital zircons have also been described from Pennsylvanian sandstone in the midcontinent (Fig9C)
If the large-scale transcontinental rivers made them all the way to Permian Basin, it is almost impossible that the fluvial systems preferentially deliver Group C zircons but don’t deliver the Group D zircons (notice the low proportion of Group D zircons in Leonardian samples and the same proportions of Group C and Group D zircons in Wolfcampian samples)Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sandstones in the Ouachita foredeep and the Fort Worth Basin also show distinct similarities in terms of proportions of main age groups and consistence of several age modes with Wolfcampian sandstone in the Permian Basin (Fig
Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sandstones in the Ouachita foredeep and the Fort Worth Basin also show distinct similarities in terms of proportions of main age groups and consistence of several age modes with Wolfcampian sandstone in the Permian Basin (Fig9C)
Hence, it is possible that Wolfcampian sandstones either shared a similar age source terrane or were partially recycled from Carboniferous strata associated with the Fort Worth Basin and Ouachita orogenic beltPennsylvanian Fort Worth Basin sandstone provenance has been linked to the Appalachian foreland and/or Sabine terrane, a Gondwanan terrane incorporated in the Ouachita orogen during Alleghanian transpression (Alsalem et al., 2017)
Pennsylvanian Fort Worth Basin sandstone provenance has been linked to the Appalachian foreland and/or Sabine terrane, a Gondwanan terrane incorporated in the Ouachita orogen during Alleghanian transpression (Alsalem et al., 2017)This recycling process is consistent with westward progradation of sediment from the Fort Worth Basin and Eastern Shelf to the Midland Basin during Pennsylvanian and early Permian by fluvial and deltaic systems (Brown et al., 1990; Wright, 2011) and south to north deep-water sediment delivery systems in the south of the Permian Basin (Hamlin, 2009)
This recycling process is consistent with westward progradation of sediment from the Fort Worth Basin and Eastern Shelf to the Midland Basin during Pennsylvanian and early Permian by fluvial and deltaic systems (Brown et al., 1990; Wright, 2011) and south to north deep-water sediment delivery systems in the south of the Permian Basin (Hamlin, 2009)Detrital zircon age peaks in Group B (350–500 Ma) and Group C (500–850 Ma) from Pennsylvanian sandstones in the Fort Worth Basin are also very similar to detrital zircon age peaks observed in the Santa Rosa Formation in southern Mexico, suggesting that the Maya terrane might be the ultimate source region and tectonic hinterland for both of these late Paleozoic depositional sequences.

In the Middle Pennsylvanian, peri-Gondwanan terranes of Mexico and Central America accreted to the southern Laurentian margin and the main phase of the Alleghanian orogeny began.In the Late Pennsylvanian (Fig
In the Late Pennsylvanian (Fig10B), the syn-orogenic stage, the Maya terrane and the emerging Marathon collision belt provided Group C (500–850 Ma) and Group D (850– 1300 Ma) detrital zircons to the Wolfcamp C Formation
Grenvillian (950–1300 Ma) zircons from the Appalachians were potentially delivered by transcontinental fluvial system to the Permian Basin (Figs9 and 10B)
During the postorogenic Guadalupian (ca260–272 Ma) stage, both the Appalachians and Mexican hinterland acted as sources for detrital zircons delivered to the Permian Basin (Figs
260–272 Ma) stage, both the Appalachians and Mexican hinterland acted as sources for detrital zircons delivered to the Permian Basin (Figs9 and 10D)
Some detrital zircon input from Appalachian detritus, such as Group B (350–500 Ma) and Group D (850–1300 Ma) detrital zircons, might have been routed into the Permian Basin via axial drainage systemsAs most Guadalupian samples were obtained from the northern Delaware Basin (Soreghan and Soreghan, 2013; Xie et al., 2018a), in contrast to sample locations used for this study, more regional and higher density sampling is needed to fully characterize the sediment provenance of the Guadalupian stage in the middle and south of the Delaware Basin to explore the drivers for provenance shift from Leonardian to Guadalupian stage.

Maya terrane, Fort Worth Basin, and Ouachita orogenic belt acted as major source regions for the Permian BasinDuring Leonardian times, during the waning stages of the AlleghanianOuachita-Marathon shortening in the southwestern United States, the relative proportions of Grenvillian sources, possibly from the Appalachian system and Ouachita orogenic belt, significantly decreased with a concomitant increase of Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic detrital zircon age components derived from Gondwanan and peri-Gondwanan terranes of Mexico and Central America such as Maya, Coahuila, Oaxaquia, and Mixtecan terranes.
