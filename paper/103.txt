The Orange Basin, offshore South Africa, formed as a result of Gondwana break-up and rifting during the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous periods followed by drifting apart of the African and South American platesA number of wells have been drilled over the last three decades in the Orange Basin, focussed primarily in water depths of less than 500m with gas/condensate and one oil discovery in the syn-rift succession illustrating a working petroleum system
Lower Cretaceous (Albian age) sandstones of the Orange Basin conformably overlie Aptian age sedimentary rocks including potential source rocks for Albian reservoirs, although well testing has yet to demonstrate commercial volumes of hydrocarbonsThis work examines sandstones sampled from well A-W1 and attempts to clarify sediment provenance and post-depositional diagenetic modification of these potential reservoir sands through a combination of analytical techniques including  thin section petrographic characterization, X-ray diffractometry (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses (major element analysis after Al-Harbi and Khan, 2008), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
The data generated from these analytical techniques have been utilized to interpret the diagenetic and geochemical variation and development of the Albian sands of this well as characteristic of the potential play area.Albian age sandstones have a detrital mineralogy dominated by quartz, K-feldspar and mica and range from greywacke to litharenites
Albian age sandstones have a detrital mineralogy dominated by quartz, K-feldspar and mica and range from greywacke to litharenitesDiagenetic modifications include feldspar and lithic fragment dissolution, compaction and reduction of the depositional porosity through grain rearrangements, rotation and fragmentation of grains and cementation (primarily quartz and carbonate)
The Lower Cretaceous Albian age sandstone of the AW-1 well, which forms the focus of this study, is located on the South African Atlantic margin of South Africa between 31° and 33° latitude (Figure 1) in the offshore Orange BasinThe offshore Orange Basin extends for approximately 50 km between Cape Town and the Namibian border with South Africa
It was formed as a result of break-up of South America and Africa in the Late Jurassic, followed by seafloor spreading and the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean in the Early Cretaceous around 136 Ma (Macdonald et al., 2003; Reeves and Wit, 2000; Brown et al., 1996)It was formed within a divergent plate boundary setting in response to extension related to the break-up of Gondwana.
The sedimentary fill is postulated to be perhaps as old as Jurassic, but the oldest dated sediments are Hauterivian (Lower Cretaceous)The sediments within the basin have a continental characteristic, deposited with intermittent volcanic events in basaltic interbeds (Fatti et al., 1994)
These basalts are coeval with sediments of the Barremian transgressive succession and illustrate the volcanic nature of the western marginThe western margin comprises a number of crustal segments, with the southern rifted margin component (Visser, 1994) and the Cretaceous sediments of the basin varying from purely continental in the east to deep marine in the west (Petroleum Agency SA, 2006).
The western margin comprises a number of crustal segments, with the southern rifted margin component (Visser, 1994) and the Cretaceous sediments of the basin varying from purely continental in the east to deep marine in the west (Petroleum Agency SA, 2006).The Albian successions of the Orange Basin typically consist of thick and thin-bedded clay-silt and sand successions with common thin shaley beds
The Albian successions of the Orange Basin typically consist of thick and thin-bedded clay-silt and sand successions with common thin shaley bedsThe thin nature of the beds presents a difficulty in resolving potential thin-bedded reservoir units using standard wireline techniques (Derder, 2003)
An identified gas reservoir interval within the Albian of the Orange basin consists of an association of coarsening upward, laminated and bioturbated mudstones to massive planar cross-bedded sandstones illustrating evidence of reducing conditions (Muntingh, 1993)This deposition is clearly shallow marine and the reservoir interval defined in well AW-1 is similarly a heterogeneous succession consisting of massive sands with rare shale laminations and thinly bedded sand with abundant shaly/silty interlamination.
The grain size of the Albian age sandstones in the well AW-1 well range from fine to medium-coarseSorting ranges from poor to well-sorted and roundness is predominantly angular to sub-angular
All incipient stage chlorites from Albian sandstone (Figure 5e) occur exclusively within parent grains with a chain-like architectureThis distribution strongly implies that the formation of chlorite was closely related to kaolinite formed from alteration of mica (chloritization of mica) as seen in thin section photomicrographs (Figure 3a and c).

The major element composition of the Albian age sandstones measured in this study are used to classify the sandstones according to the method of Pettijohn et al (1987) and presented in Table 3.A-W1 well sandstones range in type from lithic arenite to greywacke classification
(1972) and Herron (1988) sandstone classification diagram (Figure 9), the Albian age sandstone of A-W1 plots within the greywacke regionHowever, the greywacke is chemically immature sandstone, suggesting minimum degree of weathering during erosion, deposition and transport
The compositional maturity of the Albian Sandstone decreases with depthThe relative timing of diagenetic processes in A-W1 well is suggested to be mica and K-feldspar weathering and alteration to kaolinite
