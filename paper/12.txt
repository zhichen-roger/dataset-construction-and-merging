Late Cretaceous to middle Tertiary basin evolution in the centralTibetan Plateau: Changing environments in response to tectonic partitioning, aridifi cation, and regional elevation gain
Located in the Bangong suture zone between the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes of central Tibet, the Nima basin records Cretaceous–late Miocene sediment accumulation during a period of drastically changing paleogeography and paleoelevationThe Bangong suture zone originally formed during Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous time as the Lhasa terrane collided with the Qiangtang terrane

In the northern Nima basin, deposition continued during latest Cretaceous time, recording arid paleoclimate in evaporitic lacustrine and eolian dune-fi eld depositsBy Oligocene time the Nima basin comprised two independent depocenters that accumulated coarse-grained alluvial, fl uvial, lacustrine (evaporitic), and fan-delta deposits in close association with reactivated thrusts in the Bangong suture zone.

Sedimentary basins of Cretaceous and Tertiary age are widespread in the Tibetan Plateau (Fig1), and they record environmental change (Zhang et al., 2004), paleoelevation (Garzione et al., 2000; Rowley and Currie, 2006), and tectonic processes (Tapponnier et al., 2001; Horton et al., 2002; Ding et al., 2005; Kapp et al., 2005) that are crucial for evaluating the plethora of published models for the origin of the plateau
Although Cretaceous–Tertiary basins have been studied in many regions along the margins of the Tibetan Plateau (Metivier et al., 1998; Zhang, 2000; Liu and Wang, 2001; Horton et al., 2002; Yin et al., 2002; Garzione et al., 2003; Robinson et al., 2003; Ritts et al., 2004; Spurlin et al., 2005; Ding et al., 2005), the record of basin evolution in the vast (>106 km2), remote, high-elevation (~5 km average elevation) interior of the plateau remains largely unknown (Schneider et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2004; Leier et al., 2007a)These interior basins provide an archive of the transition from marine conditions during the middle Cretaceous (Bally et al., 1980; Leeder et al., 1988; Zhang et al., 2004; Leier et al., 2007a) to arid, high-elevation conditions during the middle Tertiary (Rowley and Currie, 2006; DeCelles et al., 2007)
These interior basins provide an archive of the transition from marine conditions during the middle Cretaceous (Bally et al., 1980; Leeder et al., 1988; Zhang et al., 2004; Leier et al., 2007a) to arid, high-elevation conditions during the middle Tertiary (Rowley and Currie, 2006; DeCelles et al., 2007)The ~5000 m increase in regional elevation that occurred in this time interval imparted a distinct imprint on the environments of deposition and resulting sedimentary deposits of the plateau interior
Cretaceous–Tertiary clastic sedimentary and volcanogenic rocks of the northern Lhasa terrane and adjacent Bangong suture zoneThis work was done in tandem with structural and geochronological studies that are summarized in Kapp et al
Our results show that the central part of the Tibetan Plateau has evolved from a volcanically active retroarc tectonic setting during the Cretaceous to a region of high local topographic relief associated with active fold-thrust belts during the Late Cretaceous through middle TertiaryAn arid climate was established by the Late Cretaceous, and high (≥4.6 km) regional elevation developed by late Oligocene time

Collision between the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes along the Bangong suture occurred during Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous time (Dewey et al., 1988)The surface geology of the Lhasa terrane is characterized by widespread Cretaceous and Tertiary sedimentary and volcanogenic strata; local exposures of Jurassic, Triassic, and upper Paleozoic sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks; and Cretaceous–early Tertiary granitoid rocks of the Gangdese magmatic belt (Chen and Li, 1984; N
The surface geology of the Lhasa terrane is characterized by widespread Cretaceous and Tertiary sedimentary and volcanogenic strata; local exposures of Jurassic, Triassic, and upper Paleozoic sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks; and Cretaceous–early Tertiary granitoid rocks of the Gangdese magmatic belt (Chen and Li, 1984; NWang, 1984; Debon et al., 1986; Kidd et al., 1988; Pan, 1993; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Ding et al., 2003; Pan et al., 2004; Kapp et al., 2003, 2005, 2007).
Over an ~150 km east-west distance along the suture zone lie widespread outcrops of nonmarine strata that were previously inferred to be Triassic, Cretaceous, and early Tertiary in age (Cheng and Xu, 1986; Schnei der et al., 2003; Pan et al., 2004)Recent geochronological data, however, indicate that all of these rocks are of middle Cretaceous to middle Tertiary age (Kapp et al., 2005, 2007)
Recent geochronological data, however, indicate that all of these rocks are of middle Cretaceous to middle Tertiary age (Kapp et al., 2005, 2007)In the Nima area, these outcrops occur in east-west–trending mountain ranges that fl ank the modern, internally drained Dagze Lake basin (Fig
For simplicity, we refer to the large basin, or basin complex, in which these Cretaceous–Tertiary strata accumulated as the Nima basinOur analysis suggests that the greater Nima basin originated as a single, wide basin during middle Cretaceous time (the Asa basin of Zhang et al., 2004) and was subsequently shortened and tectonically partitioned into two separate basins—the northern and southern Nima sub-basins—during Late Cretaceous and middle Tertiary time
Our analysis suggests that the greater Nima basin originated as a single, wide basin during middle Cretaceous time (the Asa basin of Zhang et al., 2004) and was subsequently shortened and tectonically partitioned into two separate basins—the northern and southern Nima sub-basins—during Late Cretaceous and middle Tertiary timeThe present north-south span of the Nima basin is ~50 km, but palinspastically restored regional cross sections indicate that the basin was originally >110 km wide (Kapp et al., 2007).
Nima basin fi ll rests unconformably on top of penetratively deformed, low-grade metasedimentary rocks assigned to the Upper Jurassic– Lower Cretaceous (Fig1; Kapp et al., 2007)
The southern boundary of the basin is marked by the regionally extensive, southward-dipping Gaize-Siling Tso thrust with the northernmost exposures of the Aptian–Albian Langshan Formation in its hanging wall (Kapp et al., 2005)The Langshan Formation, which consists of rudist-bearing and foraminiferal limestone, is the youngest clear-cut marine deposit in the Lhasa terrane (Leeder et al., 1988; Zhang et al., 2004; Leier et al., 2007a)
The northern boundary of the Nima basin is formed by the northward-dipping Muggar thrust, which carries Jurassic(?) metapelitic and metavolcanic rocks and Cretaceous (ca118 Ma; Kapp et al., 2007) granites in its hanging wall
Cretaceous paleocurrent dataPaleocurrent data were gathered from imbricated clasts and a few trough cross-stratifi ed sandstone beds in the Cretaceous rocks of the southern Nima basin
Paleocurrent data were gathered from imbricated clasts and a few trough cross-stratifi ed sandstone beds in the Cretaceous rocks of the southern Nima basinThese data show a consistently southward paleofl ow direction for the lower, volcanic-rich part of the succession (the Lower Redbed unit and the conglomeratic upper part of the Middle Volcanic unit) and a consistently northward paleofl ow direction for the Upper Conglomerate unit (Fig
Summary of southern Nima basin CretaceousThe Cretaceous strata of the southern Nima basin represent an overall upward transition from vent-proximal, lava and pyroclastic fl ow deposits, to volcanogenic alluvial fan deposits, to sedimentary clast-rich alluvial fan deposits that were closely associated with thrust-faulted highlands to the south in the hanging wall of the Gaize-Siling Tso thrust
The Cretaceous strata of the southern Nima basin represent an overall upward transition from vent-proximal, lava and pyroclastic fl ow deposits, to volcanogenic alluvial fan deposits, to sedimentary clast-rich alluvial fan deposits that were closely associated with thrust-faulted highlands to the south in the hanging wall of the Gaize-Siling Tso thrustDepositional environments were mainly alluvial fans and shallow braided streams
However, >2 km of strata overlie the dated rocks, suggesting that the unit as a whole extends well into the MioceneThe Gray Conglomerate unit contains clasts of mylonitic granite, most likely derived from granites in the footwall of the normal fault bounding the Tangra Yumco rift to the south of the Nima region (Taylor et al., 2003); these granites were probably not exposed prior to rifting, which took place in middle to late Miocene time (Yin and Harrison, 2000; Kapp and Guynn, 2004)
The Gray Conglomerate unit contains clasts of mylonitic granite, most likely derived from granites in the footwall of the normal fault bounding the Tangra Yumco rift to the south of the Nima region (Taylor et al., 2003); these granites were probably not exposed prior to rifting, which took place in middle to late Miocene time (Yin and Harrison, 2000; Kapp and Guynn, 2004)Therefore, we tentatively assign a late Miocene–Pliocene age to the Gray Conglomerate unit.
Therefore, we tentatively assign a late Miocene–Pliocene age to the Gray Conglomerate unit.Nima Redbed unit
Clasts of reworked conglomerate derived from the Cretaceous Upper Conglomerate unit are common (Fig5B)

Our geochronologic data from the Nima area suggest that the progradational sequences of sections 1DC and 2DC are approximately the same age (late Oligocene) as the lower mixed fl uvial and lacustrine interval of section 1NM (Fig2)
This implies that the paleodrainage pattern in the Nima basin region was radically altered sometime in the late Miocene, from internally drained to open toward the east.The stratigraphic succession of the northern part of the Nima basin is well exposed in the river valley that fl ows southward from the glaciated 6000 m peaks of the Muggar Gangri (Fig
8) suggest a Late Cretaceous–Paleogene age (Data Repository; see footnote 1)The Lower Muggar unit in section 3MK is separated from the Upper Muggar unit in section 2MK by a south-dipping thrust fault, and section 2MK is separated from section 6 MK by a similarly south-dipping thrust fault (Fig
Organic-rich siltstones in section 2MK yielded Eocene–Oligocene palynomorphs (Data Repository; see footnote 1)Palynomorphs from section 5MK (Fig
10) are most likely younger than Eocene but older than Miocene (GWaanders, 2006, personal commun.)
2, 3) suggests that the rocks in section 4MK are of Early Cretaceous age; rocks in sections 1MK and 3MK are of Late Cretaceous to early Paleocene age; rocks in section 2MK are Eocene–Oligocene; and rocks in sections 5MK and 6MK are middle Tertiary in age (probably Oligocene).Volcaniclastic unit (Lower Cretaceous)
Volcaniclastic unit (Lower Cretaceous)The oldest coarse clastic deposits in the northern Nima basin are represented by a >410-m-thick volcaniclastic sandstone, conglomerate, and tuff unit

Lower Muggar unit (Upper Cretaceous– lower Paleocene)Resting in angular unconformity on top of the Volcaniclastic unit is the Lower Muggar unit, a >400-m-thick succession of red beds, sandstones, and conglomerates that we infer to be largely of Late Cretaceous through early Tertiary age on the basis of sparse palynological data from measured section 3MK (Data Repository; see footnote 1)

These sandstones are composed almost entirely of recycled Cretaceous limestone grains and fossil fragmentsThe point-counting parameters are listed in Table 2, and recalculated modal data are given in Table 3
Sandstones of Cretaceous age in the southern Nima basin are extremely rich in lithic grains, characterized by a bimodal distribution of  volcaniclastic and sedimentaclastic compositions (Fig11)
Beginning at the base of section 2MCa, the compositions of sandstones and conglomerates in the Cretaceous change abruptly from volcaniclastic to sedimentaclastic, with the sedimentary clasts derived almost exclusively from the Aptian–Albian Langshan FormationA parallel trend of decreasing plagioclase versus increasing quartz content is present: the Upper Conglomerate unit generally lacks plagioclase, whereas the lower three units contain abundant plagioclase (Table 3)
K-feldspar is rare in almost all of the Cretaceous sandstones from the southern Nima basin (Fig11).
In contrast to the Cretaceous sandstones of the southern Nima basin, the Tertiary sandstones have recycled orogentype provenance (Dickinson and Suczek, 1979; Dickinson et al., 1983) and resemble classic retroarc foreland basin sandstones (e.g., DeCelles and Hertel, 1989; Jordan, 1995).Overall, the Cretaceous–Tertiary sandstones of the southern Nima basin exhibit a change through time from magmatic-arc–dominated to thrust-belt–dominated provenance, coeval with a change in paleocurrent direction from southward to northward and the onset of erosion of the Aptian–Albian limestone in the hanging wall of the Gaize-Siling Tso thrust.
Overall, the Cretaceous–Tertiary sandstones of the southern Nima basin exhibit a change through time from magmatic-arc–dominated to thrust-belt–dominated provenance, coeval with a change in paleocurrent direction from southward to northward and the onset of erosion of the Aptian–Albian limestone in the hanging wall of the Gaize-Siling Tso thrust.Sandstones of the northern Nima basin fall into three general groupings (with a pair of outliers in the data) on standard modal provenance diagrams (Fig
Sandstones from sections 4MK (the Lower Cretaceous Volcaniclastic unit) and 5MK form group 3, and have QmFLt and QtFL modes that are typical of magmatic arc-related sandstones (Fig11)
Consideration of the modal framework compositions of northern Nima basin sandstones within our tentative chronostratigraphic framework yields the following general provenance interpretation: (1) Early Cretaceous sandstones were derived primarily from volcanic terranes of intermediate to felsic compositionCandidate source lithologies are present in the J-K unit (Fig
(2) Latest Cretaceous to middle Tertiary sandstones were derived from a source terrane composed of both plutonic and recycled orogenic provenances, perhaps consisting of Jurassic argillaceous rocks and Early Cretaceous (ca118 Ma; Kapp et al., 2007) granites that are widespread in the hanging wall of the Muggar thrust directly north of the study area
Although application of this method in Tibetan provenance studies is still in its infancy, an emerging regional data set provides constraints for interpreting detrital zircon data from the Cretaceous and Tertiary strata of the Lhasa terrane (Leier et al., 2007b).Six samples of medium-grained sandstone from the Cretaceous to Miocene strata in the

The minimum age cluster is centered on 120 Ma, which is compatible with the palynological data, suggesting a Late Cretaceous ageNo distinctive age populations older than 1000 Ma were found in this sample.
The youngest detrital zircons are in the 40–70 Ma range, signifi cantly older than the late Oligocene to late Miocene depositional agesAges of pre– 150 Ma zircons generally lie within the following intervals: (1) 230–270 Ma, (2) 300–650 Ma, (3) 750–900 Ma, and (4) 1700–1900 Ma.
The distribution of zircon ages in sample MuggarDZ1 is most consistent with derivation from nearby Early Cretaceous igneous rocks that are common in the Bangong suture zone and the Muggar Gangri (Kapp et al., 2005, 2007)The youngest zircon ages in the
Age populations of pre-Cenozoic zircons in the Nima Redbed unit (in the range 230–270 Ma, 300–650 Ma, 750–900 Ma, and 1700–1900 Ma) are similar to those reported from upper Paleozoic strata of the Lhasa terraneFigure 13
involving upper Paleozoic strata in the Lhasa terrane and Mesozoic strata in the Bangong suture zone were the ultimate sources of these zircons.Figure 15

The Lower Muggar unit apparently has no stratigraphic equivalent in the southern Nima basin, and the middle Cretaceous units in the southern Nima basin apparently have no equivalents in the northern Nima basin (Fig2)
(2007) demonstrate clearly that the southern and northern Nima basin areas received sediment derived from southern and northern source terranes, respectively, and were separated by a topographic barrier in the hanging wall of the Puzuo thrust during Late Cretaceous through Tertiary timeDepositional systems in both regions developed independently.
Our reconstruction of the paleogeography in the Nima basin region from late Early Cretaceous (Aptian) through middle Tertiary time is divided into three frames (Fig15) that are palinspastically restored according to shortening estimates from Kapp et al
The picture is vague for the Early Cretaceous (Fig15A) because of the limited exposure of rocks of this age
Nevertheless, the fact that the Aptian– Albian marine strata of the Langshan Formation do not occur north of the Gaize-Siling Tso thrust demonstrates that marine waters reached no farther north than the palinspastic location of the trace of the Gaize-Siling Tso thrustTo the north, coarse clastic sediments derived from volcanic highlands were transported southward by fl uvial systems and strongly modifi ed by pedogenesis, as shown by the rocks in section 4MK (Fig
Beginning in middle to Late Cretaceous time (ca106 Ma) the central Lhasa terrane was occupied by a regional foreland basin system that developed in response to the onset of thrust-sheet loading in the Gangdese retroarc thrust belt (Leier et al., 2007a; Kapp et al., 2004)
During Late Cretaceous to middle Tertiary time, the Nima basin was topographically partitioned into separate depocenters in the north and south, with large lakes forming in internally drained topographic lows (Fig15C)
A signifi cant implication of this reconstruction is that the paleoclimate in central Tibet was already arid by Late Cretaceous timeEvidence for an arid paleoclimate in central Tibet is also provided by stable C and O isotopic data from paleosol carbonate and lacustrine marl in the Nima Redbed unit, which suggest low soil respiration rates and highly evaporated lake waters (DeCelles et al., 2007)
Arid paleoclimate indicators in central Tibet are consistent with data from many regions of central Asia that also indicate an arid paleoclimate during the Late Cretaceous (e.g., Graham et al., 1990; Jerzykiewicz et al., 1993; Loope et al., 1998)The early and widespread development of aridity in central Asia raises doubts that aridity alone can be used to infer the timing of high elevation gain in Tibet
On the other hand, aridity during Late Cretaceous time in the northern Lhasa terrane,Figure 16

Coarse conglomerates in Upper Cretaceous were derived from hanging wall of MTConglomerate and sandstone derived from hanging wall of MT suggests Tertiary reactivation
In any case, it is well documented that the Lhasa terrane had already collided with the Qiangtang terrane by this time (Girardeau et al., 1984; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Kapp et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2004), the rate of subduction of the Neotethyan oceanic plate beneath the Lhasa terrane must have been extremely rapid (Achache et al., 1984; Besse and Courtillot, 1988), and the Bangong suture zone was undergoing shortening and denudation throughout the Aptian–Albian (Kapp et al., 2005, 2007)We therefore favor the interpretation that during the Cretaceous, the Lhasa terrane was undergoing regional shortening rather than extension (Zhang et al., 2004) or transpression (Schneider et al., 2003)
We therefore favor the interpretation that during the Cretaceous, the Lhasa terrane was undergoing regional shortening rather than extension (Zhang et al., 2004) or transpression (Schneider et al., 2003)Widespread Early Cretaceous igneous activity in central Tibet suggests moderate to low-angle subduction of the Neotethyan slab during this time (Kapp et al., 2005).
Widespread Early Cretaceous igneous activity in central Tibet suggests moderate to low-angle subduction of the Neotethyan slab during this time (Kapp et al., 2005).Beginning ca
Data from the Nima area indicate that the Gaize-Siling Tso thrust, which carried in its hanging wall the Aptian–Albian limestones, became active at this time as wellThe coarsegrained deposits in the southern Nima basin record slip on several thrust faults associated with the Gaize-Siling Tso thrust, and rapid exhumation of the Xiabie Granite in the Muggar Gangri Range suggests slip on the Muggar thrust
(2005, 2007) argued that all of the thrust faults in the Nima–Muggar Gangri area are rooted in the Bangong suture zone and that underthrusting of the Lhasa terrane beneath the Qiangtang terrane continued into Late Cretaceous timeThus, the southern and northern edges of the Lhasa terrane were shortening while its interior was fl exurally subsiding and accumulating foreland basin deposits.
Much of the Lhasa terrane was apparently uplifted and being eroded during this time period, producing the regional Late Cretaceous angular unconformity that marks the end of major regional shortening within the southern Lhasa terrane (Chen and Li, 1984; Coulon et al., 1986; Coward et al., 1988; Matte et al., 1996; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Kapp et al., 2003; Pan et al., 2004)In the southern Nima basin the onset of regional uplift and erosion was marked by the initiation of an ~50-m.y.-long hiatus (Fig
Regional Late Cretaceous uplift and erosion were followed by widespread eruption of the Linzizong Formation ignimbrites, a >3000m-thick blanket of andesite and rhyolite fl ows, pyroclastic deposits, and interbedded coarsegrained, epiclastic fl uvial facies that covered at least 105 km2 of the southern Lhasa terrane from ca65 to 48 Ma (Fig
Schematic north-south cross sections at lithosphere scale, showing the hypothetical evolution of sedimentary basins in the Lhasa terrane from Early Cretaceous to middle Tertiary time within the broader plate-tectonic framework of the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision (on the north) and subduction of Neotethyan and Greater Indian lithosphere (on the south)NB—Nima basin; GTB—Gangdese retroarc thrust belt; BSZ—Bangong suture zone.
In the Nima area the absence of stratigraphic accumulation in a region where widespread deposition had been occurring since the middle Cretaceous suggests uplift and erosion (Fig17)
By early Tertiary time, the combination of crustal thickening during the Cretaceous and thermally driven isostatic rebound following lithospheric foundering (or slab rollback) could have produced regional high elevation in the Lhasa terrane (Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al., 2004, 2005)Toward the end of this episode, the Indo-Asian collision commenced, and Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere detached from the Indian plate and sank into the mantle, setting the stage for the insertion of Greater Indian lower crust and lithosphere beneath the Lhasa terrane during the remainder of Tertiary time (DeCelles et al., 2002).
Reconstruction of the kinematic history of the Himalaya suggests that Indian lower crust had underthrust as far north as the surface trace of the Bangong suture zone by about late Oligocene time (DeCelles et al., 2002)Although it is tempting to associate the middle Tertiary shortening events in the Nima basin with the northern edge of Greater India, we note that shortening was also occurring far to the south along the Indus-Yarlung suture zone (Gangdese and Kailas thrusts) during this time (Yin et al., 1994, 1999; Murphy and Yin, 2003)
In any case, the insertion of Greater Indian crust beneath the Lhasa terrane would have increased crustal thickness to its present value (70–80 km) by late Oligocene time, and raised surface elevations to their present ~4.7 km regional average (DeCelles et al., 2007).The Nima basin in the north-central Lhasa terrane of central Tibet evolved from a wide, generally southward-draining volcaniclastic, fl uvial piedmont basin to a locally partitioned set of sub-basins genetically linked to thrust faults related to reactivation of the Bangong suture zone in Late Cretaceous and middle Tertiary time
The Nima basin in the north-central Lhasa terrane of central Tibet evolved from a wide, generally southward-draining volcaniclastic, fl uvial piedmont basin to a locally partitioned set of sub-basins genetically linked to thrust faults related to reactivation of the Bangong suture zone in Late Cretaceous and middle Tertiary timeA major hiatus in deposition from Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary time is associated with regional uplift, erosion, and widespread magmatic activity in the southern and central Lhasa terrane.
A major hiatus in deposition from Late Cretaceous to early Tertiary time is associated with regional uplift, erosion, and widespread magmatic activity in the southern and central Lhasa terrane.Depositional environments included alluvial fan, braided fl uvial, lacustrine fan-delta, ephemerally fl ooded sand-fl at, eolian dunefi eld, and large and small open and restricted lacustrine systems
By Late Cretaceous time the paleoclimate was arid enough to produce large eolian dune fi elds and evaporitic sand fl ats, and by late Oligocene time regional paleoelevation was comparable to modern elevationIn essence, the characteristic environmental features of the central Tibetan Plateau were well established by the Late Cretaceous, and regional elevation was high by middle Tertiary time
In essence, the characteristic environmental features of the central Tibetan Plateau were well established by the Late Cretaceous, and regional elevation was high by middle Tertiary timeThese observations contradict tectonic models that call for late Tertiary uplift of the Tibetan Plateau.
The tectonic evolution of the northern Lhasa terrane took place against a backdrop of regional retroarc thrust belt and foreland basin development during the middle Cretaceous, to upper mantle foundering or slab rollback and widespread silicic magmatism during the Late Cretaceous–early Tertiary, to the onset in middle Tertiary time of the present tectonic regime in which the underthrusting Indian plate (Owens and Zandt, 1997; Kind et al., 2002) helps to maintain high regional elevation and drives lower crustal fl ow eastward from beneath the Tibetan Plateau (Clark and Royden, 2000; DeCelles et al., 2002).This research was supported by the U.S
