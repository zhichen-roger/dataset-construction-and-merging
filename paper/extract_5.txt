Constraining the early Mesozoic paleogeography of the Neo– Tethyan Ocean margins is crucial for understanding the opening history of the Neo–Tethyan Ocean and the paleoposition of the southern margin of Eurasia (the Lhasa terrane) and the northern margin of India (the Tethyan Himalaya)Upper Triassic strata are well exposed in the Tethyan Himalaya (Liu and Einsele, 1994; Aikman et al., 2008; Dai et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010), the Lhasa terrane (Li et al., 2014), northwest Australia (Lewis and Sircombe, 2013) and southeast Asia (Gunawan et al., 2012;

At present, however, there is little consensus about the paleogeography of these assemblages during Late Triassic time.Several tectonic models have been proposed to explain the provenance and paleogeographic relationships between the Upper Triassic Langjiexue Formation in the Tethyan Himalaya and age-equivalent units deposited in the Lhasa terrane (Fig

These opposing models result in paleogeographic reconstructions that place the Langjiexue Formation on opposite sides of the Neo– Tethyan Ocean during the Late Triassic.Models favoring an allochthonous origin were proposed to explain the presence of Permian–Triassic detrital zircons and high whole-rock εNd(t) values in the Langjiexue Formation (Dai et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010)

The cluster of U–Pb zircon ages between 350–250 Ma suggests derivation from proximal Carboniferous–Permian igneous rocks in the Lhasa terraneThe absence of 1.8 Ga zircons in these samples and a paucity of ages between 300–200 Ma indicate that the South Qiangtang terrane is an unlikely source (Fig

Pan-African (600–500 Ma) and Grenville (1000–800 Ma) grains in these samples were most likely derived from the widely exposed Neoproterozoic–Cambrian and Grenville orogenic belts in eastern Gondwana (Fitzsimons, 2000; Veevers et al., 2006)Hence, the Indian continent was the likely source of sandstones in the Upper Triassic Nieru Formation near Lazi

A tectonic model that can reconcile these differences involves the development of the Neo–Tethyan Ocean to accommodated the deposition of the Uppert Triassic chert that separates Upper Triassic strata along the Indian and Asian sides of the Yarlung–Tsangpo sutureIn this model, provenance variations result from separation by Neo–Tethyan Ocean basins

When we compare our detrital zircon age spectra to new geochronologic data from northwest Australia (Lewis and Sircombe, 2013), Timor (Zimmermann and Hall, 2014), Sulawesi (Hennig et al., 2015) and West Papua (Gunawan et al., 2012), the presence of similar Permian–Triassic detrital zircons populations raises consideration of a tectonic model in which the Langjiexue and Nieru (Kangma) formations in Tethyan Himalaya Sequence and age-equivalent strata in the north Australia margin and outer Banda arc were derived from similar source rocksThe absence of a Permian–Triassic detrital zircon source in the Indian continent and similar detrital zircon age spectra of Permian–Triassic strata in West Papua, Timor, Sulawesi and north Australia (Fig

The absence of a Permian–Triassic detrital zircon source in the Indian continent and similar detrital zircon age spectra of Permian–Triassic strata in West Papua, Timor, Sulawesi and north Australia (Fig8) suggest that the most likely source rocks were the volcanic arc rocks related to the subduction of Panthalassic oceanic lithosphere beneath West Papua (Gunawan et al., 2012; Zimmermann and Hall, 2014).

The Upper Triassic Langjiexue Formation provides an important provenance constraint that links Greater India and continental rocks along the northern margin of Australia during the Late TriassicOriginally, the Langjiexue Formation was interpreted to have been deposited on the distal part of the Tethyan Himalaya passive margin (Liu and Einsele, 1994; Searle et al., 1987)

This model requires that India–Lhasa rifting occurred during the Late Triassic–Lower JurassicThere is substantial evidence, however, that the Lhasa terrane rifted from Gondwana prior to late Triassic time (Garzanti et al., 1999; Sciunnach and Garzanti, 2012)

There is substantial evidence, however, that the Lhasa terrane rifted from Gondwana prior to late Triassic time (Garzanti et al., 1999; Sciunnach and Garzanti, 2012)The third class of models argues that the Langjiexue Formation was deposited in an intra-oceanic or Lhasa terrane forearc basin (Li et al., 2010, 2014)

This hypothesis is also incompatible with known geological constraints, as (1) no Triassic intra-oceanic arc fragments have been documented within the YZSZ, (2) the recycled orogen provenance of the Mailonggang and Langjiexue formations is inconsistent with deposition in a forearc basin (Dickinson, 1985), and (3) the location of the Langjiexue Formation with respect to the YZSZ would require back–arc extension to rift the Langjiexue Formation from Lhasa terraneThe latter is inconsistent with recent studies indicating that the YZSZ ophiolites to the north developed in an extensional forearc rather than a back-arc setting (Maffione et al., 2015).

Furthermore, we assert that the Lhasa terrane had already rifted from Greater India and was isolated from India-derived sedimentation by the Neo–Tethyan Ocean during Late Triassic timeWe propose that a submarine fan complex developed between Papua New Guinea to the east and the North Australia shelf to the south during the Late Triassic, overlapping all terranes along the northern margin of east Gondwana (Fig

In addition, Greater India experienced anticlockwise rotation during its Cretaceous northward drift (Huang et al., 2015), such that originally west-directed paleocurrent indicators would have been rotated to the modern southerly trend observed (Li et al., 2003).The Upper Triassic Nieru Formation in the Lazi region is typical of a shallow marine depositional setting
