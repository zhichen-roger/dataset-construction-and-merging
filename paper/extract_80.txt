Subsequently, the depositional age is of utmost importance for South American and South African geology and of wide international interest as it can no longer be related to the Neoproterozoic and therefore not to the ‘snowball Earth’ hypothesis.The Sierra del Volca´n glacial diamictite is exposed in the Tandilia System, a NW–SE-striking mountain belt located 300 km south of Buenos Aires (Fig

Although the Sierra del Volca´n diamictite has been widely regarded as part of the Neoproterozoic (In˜iguez Rodr´ıguez 1999; Pazos et al2008), its stratigraphic position and age have remained uncertain, as it overlies the Palaeoproterozoic basement with an erosional unconformity and is, in turn, unconformably covered by siliciclastic rocks of the Ordovician to Silurian Balcarce Formation (Seilacher et al

Because no Archaean or older Palaeoproterozoic zircon input was identified in the zircon population, it is likely that the main sources are located in the central part of the R´ıo de la Plata craton, which would also include source rocks of Mesoproterozoic agesIt is possible that the latter may also have been situated in South Africa when interpreted with regard to palaeocurrent and provenance studies (Poire´ et al

The age of the youngest detrital zircon dated in the Sierra del Volca´n diamictite unit sets a lower age limit for sedimentation in the Ordovician.The new stratigraphic position for the Sierra del Volca´n glacial diamictite can therefore be interpreted as age-equivalent to those in Argentina and southern South America (D´ıaz Martinez & Grahn 2007) and to the Pakhuis Formation in South Africa, where the same glacial event is recorded for Gondwana (compiled by Young et al
