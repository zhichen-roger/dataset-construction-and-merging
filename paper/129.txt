The Nacimiento Franciscan belt is an allochthonous sliver of subduction assemblages in the central California Coast Ranges displaced either: (1) from southern California by >300 km of Neogene dextral slip along the San Andreas fault system or (2) from central California to southern California and back again, by >500 km of Late Cretaceous–Paleocene sinistral slip along the Sur-Nacimiento fault followed by San Andreas–related motionNew U-Pb detrital zircon data from 20 (meta)clastic samples indicate that the Nacimiento Franciscan section was assembled between ca
Abundant Cretaceous (particularly Late Cretaceous) and diminishing amounts of Jurassic and Proterozoic zircon grains point to a southern California origin for Nacimiento Franciscan protoliths, precluding significant sinistral strike-slip along the Sur-Nacimiento faultFurthermore, the suite of detrital zircon ages reported here bears a strong resemblance to new and existing data from subduction complexes in southern California that were emplaced during Laramide shallow subduction (i.e., Sierra de Salinas, Portal Ridge, Quartz Hill, Rand, San Emigdio, and Tehachapi schists)
Hence, the Nacimiento Franciscan is distinct from Franciscan rocks in central and northern California and more likely represents an outboard element of the Late Cretaceous southern California low-angle subduction systemUpon restoring the Nacimiento block to its Late Cretaceous position, an inboard-younging trend is apparent in the composite Nacimiento–southern California schist belt, suggesting that progressively younger accretionary materials were underplated farther inboard by tectonic erosion
Upon restoring the Nacimiento block to its Late Cretaceous position, an inboard-younging trend is apparent in the composite Nacimiento–southern California schist belt, suggesting that progressively younger accretionary materials were underplated farther inboard by tectonic erosionWe posit that arc and forearc elements absent from southern California were removed by a combination of physical and tectonic erosion attending shallow subduction, interleaved in the subduction complex, and recycled into the mantle
Profound along­ and across­strike variations in accretionary belt character reflect the dynamic nature of Mesozoic subduction beneath western North AmericaFor example, the northern Coast Ranges and San Francisco Bay Area contain a downward­ and westward­younging (Early Cretaceous to middle Miocene) high­pressure/low­temperature (HP/LT) structural sequence juxtaposed with forearc sediments (Unruh et al., 2007; Ernst et al., 2009; Snow et al., 2010; Dumitru et al., 2010, 2015; Wakabayashi, 2015)
For example, the northern Coast Ranges and San Francisco Bay Area contain a downward­ and westward­younging (Early Cretaceous to middle Miocene) high­pressure/low­temperature (HP/LT) structural sequence juxtaposed with forearc sediments (Unruh et al., 2007; Ernst et al., 2009; Snow et al., 2010; Dumitru et al., 2010, 2015; Wakabayashi, 2015)In contrast, in southern California, high­pressure/high­temperature subduction assemblages appear to young along strike (Late Cretaceous to Eocene) and are juxtaposed with batholithic rocks with no intervening forearc (Jacobson et al., 1988; Jacobson et al., 1996; Grove et al., 2003; Saleeby, 2003; Kidder and  Ducea, 2006; Chapman et al., 2011; Jacobson et al., 2011)
In contrast, in southern California, high­pressure/high­temperature subduction assemblages appear to young along strike (Late Cretaceous to Eocene) and are juxtaposed with batholithic rocks with no intervening forearc (Jacobson et al., 1988; Jacobson et al., 1996; Grove et al., 2003; Saleeby, 2003; Kidder and  Ducea, 2006; Chapman et al., 2011; Jacobson et al., 2011)These NW­SE variations are attributed to shallowing of the dip of the descending slab from northern to southern California (Saleeby, 2003; Liu et al., 2008, 2010).
Other workers suggest minimal trench­parallel displacement within the Nacimiento Franciscan, instead positing that these rocks were thrust beneath Cretaceous forearc basin and  batholithic rocks in southern California (Page, 1970a, 1970b; Hall, 1991; Saleeby, 2003; Ducea et al., 2009; Hall and Saleeby, 2013)The origin of the Naci miento Franciscan is disputed since, by comparison with the trench­forearc­arc triad east of the San Andreas fault, the juxtaposition of arc rocks of the Salinian block with Nacimiento assemblages along the Sur­Nacimiento fault implies the removal of a width of 150 km or greater of formerly intervening arc and forearc basin assemblages
Although general agreement exists that major displacements along this structure took place between 75 and 56 Ma (e.g., Dickinson et al., 2005; Jacobson et al., 2011), with late Cenozoic strike­slip remobilization linked to the San Andreas fault system (Hall, 1991), there is no consensus on the  nature of Late Cretaceous to Paleocene slip along the fault.The key aim here is to evaluate the thrust versus sinistral strike­slip models for the Sur­Nacimiento fault
New palinspastic and geochronologic data from the Nacimiento Franciscan provide valuable constraints on the processes that controlled clastic deposition, structural assembly, tectonic erosion, and mélange formation in the Late Cretaceous California subduction system.The sections that follow provide a geologic overview of the Nacimiento block, possibly correlative subduction assemblages in central and southern California, and the Sierra Nevada–Peninsular Ranges batholith
Ophiolitic assemblages are, in turn, unconformably overlain by forearc sedimentary rocks of the Great Valley Group, including upper most Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastic strata of the Toro Formation and Upper Cretaceous arkosic assemblages of the Atascadero Formation (Page, 1972; Hall et al., 1979; Seiders, 1982; Jacobson et al., 2011)The Nacimiento tectonostratigraphic package is bounded and internally disrupted by several strands of the dextral San Andreas fault system, including Nacimiento, Santa Ynez River, San Gregorio–Hosgri, Oceanic–West Huasna, East Huasna, and Big Pine faults (Fig

High­pressure/low­temperature mineral assemblages and thrust structures preserved in the Diablo Range and in Franciscan assemblages in northern California are widely regarded to reflect progressive underplating and metamorphism attending subduction of the oceanic Farallon plate beneath North America from Middle to Late Cretaceous time (Ernst, 1970, 1993; Mattinson and Echeverria, 1980; Unruh et al., 2007; Ernst et al., 2009; Snow et al., 2010; Dumitru et al., 2010, 2015; Wakabayashi, 2015).The Rand, San Emigdio, and Sierra de Salinas schists (referred to in aggregate as “the Rand­type schist”) and similar early Cenozoic Pelona and Orocopia schists of more southerly California crop out along detachment structures beneath older crystalline rocks of the SW Cordilleran batholithic belt (Graham and England, 1976; Haxel and Dillon, 1978; Ehlig, 1981; Jacobson, 1983, 1995; Jacobson et al., 1988, 2007, 2011; Simpson, 1990; Kidder and Ducea, 2006;  Ducea et al., 2009; Chapman et al., 2010, 2011, 2012)

The southern segment of the Cretaceous arc is referred to here as the southern California batholith (Saleeby, 2003)These spatial variations in the Sierra  Nevada–Peninsular Ranges arc and its framework are useful for pinpointing the source area(s) of arc­derived detritus.

However, it should be noted that Cenomanian–Coniacian forearc strata in the central Great Valley yield U­Pb zircon maximum depositional ages approximately 10–20 Ma older than the fossil­based depositional ages of these rocks (DeGraaff­Surpless et al., 2002; Sharman et al., 2015; Wakabayashi, 2015)We attribute this time lag between detrital zircon and actual depositional ages in the central Great Valley to the deposition of these rocks outboard of a Jurassic–Early Cretaceous arc segment
We attribute this time lag between detrital zircon and actual depositional ages in the central Great Valley to the deposition of these rocks outboard of a Jurassic–Early Cretaceous arc segmentThe depositional setting of these rocks resulted in a higher proportion of Jurassic–Early Cretaceous to Late Cretaceous zircon grains, a signature that we refer to in the section on the Origin of the Nacimiento Block as that of “central California.” We now discuss the salient geochronologic and petrographic features of each group in order to clarify the Late Cretaceous evolution of the Nacimiento Franciscan.

The lack of significant proportions of pre­Early Cretaceous grains strongly suggests a source for Group 1A detritus within the western Sierran­Peninsular Ranges magmatic arc, which at the time of deposition must have served as a topographic barrier, blocking craton interior debris from reaching the trench (e.g., Jacobson et al., 2011; Sharman et al., 2015).In comparison with Group 1A sandstones, turbidite systems represented by Group 1B samples are ~5 m.y
These groups differ in that Group 2A sandstones include more Jurassic and Late Cretaceous  detrital zircon grains and are less mature, containing abundant volcanic fragmentsThese relations suggest increased delivery of first­cycle clastic detritus from the arc, across the trench­slope break, and into the Nacimiento trench
The observed influx of Late Cretaceous and Jurassic detrital zircon grains beginning at ca90 Ma suggests the input of material from farther inboard, most likely from the eastern Sierran­Peninsular Ranges arc, for the following reasons: (1) pluton ages in the arc are zoned from ca
100–80 Ma in the east, and (2) at the latitude of southern California, the eastern arc contains a higher proportion of intruded older arc segments, providing an explanation for the higher proportion of Jurassic grains in Group 2.Group 2B assemblages record continued input of Jurassic grains into the trench after ca

Curiously, slabs and Group 3 deposits show significantly lower proportions of Jurassic and higher amounts of pre­Mesozoic grains relative to Group 2The uptick in the proportion of Precambrian detrital zircon grains from Group 1 and Group 2 to Group 3 is likely the result of either (1) the latter group tapping shallow­water (miogeoclinal), passive­margin wall rocks in the eastern Sierra Nevada or (2) recycling Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous forearc assemblages such as the Toro Formation, which contains significant populations of pre­Mesozoic and Jurassic detrital zircon grains (Johnston, 2013)

Such channelways would allow transport of Precambrian zircon­bearing detritus derived from the craton interior toward the marginHowever, we consider this model unlikely, given that the detrital zircon­based signal for geomorphic breachment of the Cretaceous arc does not appear in the forearc until Maastrichtian time (e.g., Jacobson et al., 2011; Sharman et al., 2015).

The Proterozoic age peak doublet exhibited by Type E rocks is unique and points to an ultimate source in central Idaho (Dumitru et al., 2016)The recognition of Type E detrital zircon distributions in Franciscan trench assemblages led Dumitru et al
We propose that the proto–San Gregorio–Hosgri fault represents a Late Cretaceous intra­ wedge thrust fault, adjacent to which a trench­slope (e.g., Smith et al., 1979) or trench­axis (Ogawa et al., 2014) basin system developed, and that the fault reactivated in Neogene time as a strand of the San Andreas wrench system.Slabs exposed west and east of the San Gregorio–Hosgri fault are commonly used as piercing points for constraining the magnitude of Neogene dextral slip along the fault (Smith et al., 1979; Hall, 1991; Dickinson et al., 2005)
Slabs exposed west and east of the San Gregorio–Hosgri fault are commonly used as piercing points for constraining the magnitude of Neogene dextral slip along the fault (Smith et al., 1979; Hall, 1991; Dickinson et al., 2005)Estimates of Neogene dextral slip along this structure range widely from ~180 to <5 km (Sedlock and Hamilton, 1991; Burnham, 1998; Clark, 1998; Burnham, 1999; Dickinson et al., 2005)
Estimates of Neogene dextral slip along this structure range widely from ~180 to <5 km (Sedlock and Hamilton, 1991; Burnham, 1998; Clark, 1998; Burnham, 1999; Dickinson et al., 2005)While constraining the magnitude of Neogene displacement along the San Gregorio–Hosgri fault is beyond the scope of this effort, our results showing similar distributions of detrital zircon ages in Pfeiffer and Point San Luis slabs support earlier correlations of these rocks and ~155 km of Neogene dextral slip along the San Gregorio–Hosgri fault (Dickinson et al., 2005).
While constraining the magnitude of Neogene displacement along the San Gregorio–Hosgri fault is beyond the scope of this effort, our results showing similar distributions of detrital zircon ages in Pfeiffer and Point San Luis slabs support earlier correlations of these rocks and ~155 km of Neogene dextral slip along the San Gregorio–Hosgri fault (Dickinson et al., 2005).Current models for Late Cretaceous–early Cenozoic slip along the Sur­Nacimiento fault include: (1) the fault is a thrust with ~150 km offset that placed Cretaceous batholithic rocks above the Cretaceous forearc basin and subduction complex outboard of the Mojave Desert (e.g., Page, 1970a, 1970b; Hall, 1991; Ducea et al., 2009); and (2) the fault is a sinistral tectonic escape structure with ~500–900 km offset that formed in response to collision of an aseismic ridge (e.g., Dickinson, 1983; Dickinson et al., 2005; Jacobson et al., 2011)
Current models for Late Cretaceous–early Cenozoic slip along the Sur­Nacimiento fault include: (1) the fault is a thrust with ~150 km offset that placed Cretaceous batholithic rocks above the Cretaceous forearc basin and subduction complex outboard of the Mojave Desert (e.g., Page, 1970a, 1970b; Hall, 1991; Ducea et al., 2009); and (2) the fault is a sinistral tectonic escape structure with ~500–900 km offset that formed in response to collision of an aseismic ridge (e.g., Dickinson, 1983; Dickinson et al., 2005; Jacobson et al., 2011)The second model predicts that Nacimiento Franciscan and Great Valley Group assemblages originated outboard of the Diablo Range–San Francisco Bay Area in central California.
Distinguishing between an outboard southern versus central California origin for the Nacimiento block based on detrital zircon age distributions is challenging, given that each setting lies outboard of the Sierra Nevada batholith, which supplied significant amounts of Cretaceous zircon to the forearc and trench over >1000 km along strikeHowever, “central California” and “southern California” paleogeographic signatures may be distinguished based on the rela tive proportions of Jurassic plus Early Cretaceous to Late Cretaceous  detrital zircon grain distributions
However, “central California” and “southern California” paleogeographic signatures may be distinguished based on the rela tive proportions of Jurassic plus Early Cretaceous to Late Cretaceous  detrital zircon grain distributionsFor example, the NNW­trending Late Cretaceous arc was emplaced at an angle to the NW­trending, Jurassic–Early Cretaceous continental arc such that the older arc resides outboard of the younger in central Cali fornia, and vice versa in southern California (e.g., Ernst, 2015; Sharman et al., 2015; Fig
For example, the NNW­trending Late Cretaceous arc was emplaced at an angle to the NW­trending, Jurassic–Early Cretaceous continental arc such that the older arc resides outboard of the younger in central Cali fornia, and vice versa in southern California (e.g., Ernst, 2015; Sharman et al., 2015; Fig1 inset)
As a result, a “central California” detrital zircon signal should include a relatively high proportion of Jurassic–Early Cretaceous to Late Cretaceous grains, given the position of the Jurassic–Early Cretaceous arc outboard of the Late Cretaceous arc, which likely represented a geomorphic barrier to detritus sourced from the continental interiorUnderplated Rand­type schists
All four groups of Nacimiento rocks, plus Franciscan slabs and forearc assemblages of the Atascadero Formation, exhibit significantly higher proportions of Late Cretaceous to Jurassic–Early Cretaceous detrital zircon grains, and hence show “southern California” signaturesThis observation supports an outboard Mojave origin for the Nacimiento block and is incompatible with the left­slip tectonic escape model.
As concluded above, the Nacimiento block likely originated outboard of southern California, where the Laramide shallow subduction (see footnote 1)– related, Late Cretaceous Rand­type, and early Cenozoic Pelona and Orocopia schists crop out (Graham and England, 1976; Haxel and Dillon, 1978; Ehlig, 1981; Jacobson, 1983, 1995; Jacobson et al., 1988, 2007, 2011; Simpson, 1990; Kidder and Ducea, 2006; Ducea et al., 2009; Chapman et al., 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013)The Nacimiento Franciscan and Late Cretaceous Rand­type schists are each elements of the subduction complex, contain similar proportions of metaclastic to metabasaltic rocks, exhibit strikingly similar detrital zircon age spectra with overlapping maximum depositional (ca

Furthermore, the inboard remains of the Late Cretaceous subduction megathrust flat (locally the Rand fault and Salinas shear zone; Jacobson, 1995; Kidder and Ducea, 2006; Chapman et al., 2010) are analogous to the outboard Coast Range fault (Bailey et al., 1970; Platt, 1986; Jayko et al., 1987).One of the most striking features of Rand­type schists is a pronounced shift in maximum depositional and metamorphic ages from >90 Ma in the northwest to <50 Ma in the southeast (Fig
Palinspastic restoration of the Nacimiento Franciscan to its Late Cretaceous position outboard of the Mojave Desert provides critical constraints on this issueIn contrast to the schist outcrop belt, no clear relationship exists between calculated maximum depositional ages with position, strike parallel or perpendicular, along the Nacimiento Franciscan (Fig
11), providing an explanation for the post­Campanian depositional hiatus in the Nacimiento Great Valley Group and the widespread presence of Maastrichtian marine sediments in the Salinian blockThis hypothesis also provides an intriguing explanation for the Big Creek “klippe” (Hall, 1991; Dickinson et al., 2005; Hall and Saleeby, 2013), which we interpret as an erosional remnant of extensional tectonostratigraphy.
Aside from the presence of Late Jurassic exotic blocks in mélange, the Nacimiento Franciscan apparently lacks accretionary materials older than ca95 Ma, indicating that the first >60 m.y
Franciscan assemblages outside the Nacimiento block also display significant variations in accretion rate; but these took place chiefly in Early Cretaceous time (Dumitru et al., 2010; Ernst, 2011) and are tentatively attributed to changes in convergence vectors between North America and outboard oceanic plates (Engebretson et al., 1985; Seton et al., 2012).If the Nacimiento block is, as we suggest, a product of Laramide shallow subduction (see footnote 1), then why was the trench preserved while the forearc and western magmatic arc were apparently obliterated by oceanic plateau collision? In comparison with the trench­forearc­arc system preserved east of the San Andreas fault in central California, inner forearc and western arc elements are scarce in Late Cretaceous reconstructions of southern California (Page, 1981; Dickinson, 1983; Hall, 1991; James et al., 1993; Schott and Johnson, 1998; Schott et al., 2004; Dickinson et al., 2005; Jacobson et al., 2011; Chapman et al., 2012; Sharman et al., 2015)

Based on abundant ca
The presence of these lithologies structurally above the Late Cretaceous subduction megathrust ~200 km inboard from the margin implies that a nontrivial amount of western arc material was carried to significant depths in the subduction zone by subduction erosion (Fig11).
If western arc and inner forearc domains were translated away from southern California by Late Cretaceous strike slip, then they should be recognized somewhere along the continental marginInasmuch as the western arc and inner forearc are virtually nowhere to be seen, unless these elements are in the Peninsular Ranges (Dickinson, 1983), it is more likely that these rocks were removed by a combination of surficial erosion from above (and incorporation of this material into the subduction complex) and tectonic erosion from below (and subduction of this material into the mantle).
82 Ma and Campanian microfossils (Evitt, 1967, written communin Hsü, 1969; Hall, 1991; Jacobson et al., 2011), atop mélange provides a minimum age constraint on the timing of mélange formation
Hence, mélange in the vicinity of San Simeon must have formed in the Late Cretaceous and probably occurred within a narrow ca85–80 Ma window
Group 1 rocks contain abundant Middle Cretaceous (ca100–120 Ma) zircon grains with few older grains and yield the oldest maximum depositional ages ranging from ca
93 to 85 Ma, and contain relatively abundant Late Cretaceous (ca80–100) and Early Cretaceous to Jurassic (ca
80–100) and Early Cretaceous to Jurassic (ca120–200 Ma) zircon grains
87–82 Ma and contain higher proportions of Precambrian zircon grains than Group 2 but lack Jurassic grainsGroup 3 rocks contain similar detrital zircon age populations, are petrographically similar to trench­slope basin “slabs,” and are interpreted here as slab materials incorporated in mélange through sedimentary processes
Group 3 and trench­slope basin rocks are, in turn, interpreted as distal equivalents to the Upper Cretaceous Atascadero Formation on the basis of petrographic and geochronologic similarities.In aggregate, all Nacimiento sample groups, including trench­slope deposits, show a closer affinity to subduction­accretion assemblages exposed in southern California (e.g., the Sierra de Salinas, Rand, San Emigdio, and Pelona schists) than to Franciscan rocks exposed in central California (e.g., in the  Diablo Range and San Francisco Bay Area)
Siliciclastic assemblages in the Nacimiento Franciscan record the uplift, erosion, inboard migration of arc magmatism, and extensional collapse of the southern California batholith that accompanied Late Cretaceous collision and passage of an oceanic plateau beneath southern California (Wood and Saleeby, 1997; Saleeby, 2003; Liu et al., 2008, 2010; Chapman et al., 2012)We posit that a significant volume of inner forearc and western arc material, now absent from southern California, was eroded and interleaved in the shallow subduction (see footnote 1) complex
