Chemostratigraphy, petrography, and SEM investigations of the Lower Triassic Montney Formation in Alberta: Implications for a new and revised diagenetic and depositional modelH igh resolution chemostratigraphy of the Montney Formation across Alberta identifies three unique and distinct chemostratigraphic units, referred to as CS1-3, with several subunits (i.e
This study focuses on the lowermost units (CS1a, 1b, 2) of the Montney Formation in Alberta, deposited during the Triassic Induan Period and proposes a new depositional model that largely contradicts the current depositional models of a basinal turbidite systemEvidence for a new model are derived from geochemical, petrographic and SEM data
Hence, the depositional model for the Lower Triassic Montney Formation in Alberta proposes a back-arc, semi-restricted shallow carbonate shelf with prolific benthic/planktonic shell productivity due to limited species diversity following the Permian-Triassic extinction event and limited terrestrial influx (varies locally)High benthic biogenic productivity suggests oxic bottom water conditions and possibly elevated salinity (to limit species diversity) that led to excess NaCl in the pore waters after deposition

Paleogeographic location of the WCSB during Triassic time (approximately 245 Ma ago) showing both the approaching volcanic arc and back– arc setting where the Montney was deposited as well as diff erent terrane settingsThe approaching Yukon–Tanana Terrane created a semi–enclosed ocean basin within which ocean circulation may have been limited
deposits around the globe have been linked to marked ocean bottom water anoxia during the Permian-Triassic extinction event (i.eAlgeo et al., 2007; Song et al., 2013; Lei et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017)
Here we present some of the characteristic high-resolution geochemical proxies to identify potential oxic/ reducing conditions of the bottom water during deposition of the early Triassic Montney sediments in the WCSB.Geochemical profiling or chemical stratigraphy (chemostratigraphy) is used commonly in petroleum exploration to identify similarities between units and hence correlate similar units across larger distances or across entire basins
5) deposited during the Lower Triassic Induan Stage (Griesbachian-Dienerian) (Fig2) to highlight issues overlooked in the past
CS2/CS3) coincides with the identified Induan/Olenekian sequence boundary (Fig5) of well 10-13-75-4W6M (Davies et al., 1997b).
Units CS1 and CS2 represent sediments deposited during the Lower Triassic Period (Induan Stage) that are separated by a sequence boundary from the overlying units CS3 (Fig5)
Namibian shelf shows two sources) regarded as analogs of the Lower Triassic Montney Formation;Morphological and CL analyses demonstrate that CS1 and CS2 have few detrital, but abundant authigenic quartz (some microcrystalline) typical of biogenic origin embedded within authigenic dolomite and other minerals;
Carbonate concretions in the Lower Triassic Montney Formation include bedded biogenic remains, both macroscopic bivalves and microscopic nanofossils (radiolaria?), and concretions with typical nuclei are absentThese concretions are critical for insights into the sediments prior to marked diagenetic overprints;
The discussion will address these issues and presents a new depositional model that explains sedimentary features, sediment composition and diagenetic alterations of the Lower Triassic deposits in Alberta.PCA and origin of minerals in the Lower Montney units CS1-2
In a study from the Upper Cretaceous Eagle Ford, it was demonstrated that about 85 percent of the total quartz in the rocks is authigenic (Milliken et al., 2016)The Eagle Ford study shows former opaline skeletons of radiolarian are only
Timing of the diagenetic changes is difficult to determine but it is assumed that diagenesis of the Lower Triassic Montney units started shortly after burialBiogenic silica is metastable and transforms quickly, although recent studies of sedimentary basins with biogenic sediments observed that a burial depth of 800–900 m and temperatures of 70–90°C are needed for a rapid transition from opal-A to opal CT and quartz (Wrona et al., 2017)
20–30 percent) in the Lower Triassic Montney Formation (Fig9) is comparable to the amount of quartz which, according to classical siliciclastic model, implies a high feldspathic source
A more recent study of Permian shales in France observed hydrothermal diagenetic feldspar as well as authigenic chlorite and illite (Brockamp and Clauer, 2013)Although CS1 and CS2 units contain authigenic feldspar (Fig
Although framboidal pyrite is common throughout the Lower Triassic Montney, the concretions contain mostly cubic and “massive” pyrite crystals rather than pure framboidal pyrite (Figs12, 14, 16, 17) suggesting that early framboidal pyrite formation may have been absent or at least limited
24) illustrating some of the processes and development of the Lower Triassic Montney Formation in Alberta (CS1 and CS2)The process explains the current sediment mineralogical and geochemical compositions.
Sea fl oor conditions during Early Triassic in the WCSB?The presence of framboidal pyrite in the Montney Formation has led to the hypothesis of seafloor anoxia during sediment deposition (Davies et al., 1997b) and global anoxic episodes have been commonly reported from many locations around the world during the late Permian and early Triassic (Tian et al., 2014) critical for the Permian/Triassic boundary mass extinction and the delayed recovery of Early Triassic marine ecosystems
The presence of framboidal pyrite in the Montney Formation has led to the hypothesis of seafloor anoxia during sediment deposition (Davies et al., 1997b) and global anoxic episodes have been commonly reported from many locations around the world during the late Permian and early Triassic (Tian et al., 2014) critical for the Permian/Triassic boundary mass extinction and the delayed recovery of Early Triassic marine ecosystemsHowever, geochemical and microscope data of the lowermost sediments of the Montney units CS1-2 in Alberta suggest that the paleodepositional environment had oxygenated bottom water condition
This is also supported by more recent work on the Lower to Middle Triassic in BC and Alberta which suggested oxic to sub-oxic settings during at least parts of the sediment deposition (Zonneveld et al., 2010; Schoepfer et al., 2013)Similarly, a new study on bioclastic intervals in the lower/ middle units of the Montney Formation in B.C
Correlations against modern Holocene samples from anoxic analogues, such as the Famvaren Fjord, Cariaco Basin, Saanich Inlet and Black Sea (Algeo and Rowe, 2012) illustrate that the Montney samples have much lower TOC as well as Mo concentrations than all other modern sites with typical anoxic bottom water conditions (Fig23)
Typical black shale environments, such as the middle Cretaceous OAE-2 event (Hetzel et al., 2009) also record high values, such as 5–25 percent TOC, 50–150 ppm of Mo and 500–2000 ppm of V, which areconcentrations at least 10 times higher than concentrations in the CS1 and CS2 units
Therefore, it is inferred that CS1-2 of the Lower Triassic Montney sediments were deposited under oxic to suboxic bottom water conditions.In a recent paper (Zhang et al., 2017), S-isotopes of pyrite from the Montney equivalent Phroso and Vega Siltstone Members of the Sulfur Mountain Formation in the Opal Creek area (BC) were determined from the Permian-Triassic boundary
In a recent paper (Zhang et al., 2017), S-isotopes of pyrite from the Montney equivalent Phroso and Vega Siltstone Members of the Sulfur Mountain Formation in the Opal Creek area (BC) were determined from the Permian-Triassic boundaryThe data was compared with samples from the Gujo-Hachiman section in Japan which represents oceanic abyssal plain deposits of the equatorial Panthalassic Ocean
The study hypothesized that shoaling of H2S-rich water may have driven the end-Permian extinction and that during Early Triassic, episodic euxinia and oscillations between sulfidic and oxic conditions halted the recovery of the marine ecosystemHowever, the isotope data (both δ34S and δ33S) show that the WCSB Opal Creek values (0 to −25‰ δ34S and 0.08 to −0.04‰ δ33S) are less than half as negative as the former Panthalassic open ocean deposits and that values are similar to other open marine records from that time, such as the Triassic Tenjinmaru section in Japan (−25 to −42‰ δ34S) (Kajiwara et al., 1994) or from the Vikinghøgda Formation in Norway (−30 to −32 ‰ δ34S) (Dustira et al., 2013)
However, the isotope data (both δ34S and δ33S) show that the WCSB Opal Creek values (0 to −25‰ δ34S and 0.08 to −0.04‰ δ33S) are less than half as negative as the former Panthalassic open ocean deposits and that values are similar to other open marine records from that time, such as the Triassic Tenjinmaru section in Japan (−25 to −42‰ δ34S) (Kajiwara et al., 1994) or from the Vikinghøgda Formation in Norway (−30 to −32 ‰ δ34S) (Dustira et al., 2013)In the WCSB, Triassic S-isotopes are much less negative than the one reported from the upper Cretaceous section in open marine sediments (Japan) or from the Early Tertiary in the Pacific (Kajiwara and Kaiho, 1992)
In the WCSB, Triassic S-isotopes are much less negative than the one reported from the upper Cretaceous section in open marine sediments (Japan) or from the Early Tertiary in the Pacific (Kajiwara and Kaiho, 1992)In addition, all modern anoxic basins (Framvaren Fjord, Black Sea, California Basin) compiled for the TOC-Mo cross-plot (Fig
Chemostratigraphy, petrographic/SEM analyses, and the high amount of minerals with conspicuous authigenic characteristics in the Lower Triassic Montney units of Alberta indicates that both a) original sediment compositions must have been dominated by metastable minerals (i.earagonite, high Mgcalcite, biogenic silica, etc.) (Fig
Unfortunately, there are few modern environments that could present an analogue for the Early Triassic of the WCSBThe end Permian extinction event (approximately 252 Ma ago) reduced ecosystems to a few surviving species (Fig
The end Permian extinction event (approximately 252 Ma ago) reduced ecosystems to a few surviving species (Fig25)
Multiple environmental shocks occurred over 10 Ma across the P/T boundary (Chen and Benton, 2012; Chen et al., 2013) that lasted into the early Triassic (Fig25)
Triassic ecosystems were rebuilt stepwise with full complex ecosystem re-emergence not occurring until the Middle Triassic, well past the deposition of the identified CS1-CS2 units of the Lower Triassic Montney Formation (Induan Stage)In the Montney Formation, the paucity of biodiversity during the Lower Triassic is striking, with few limited species like Unionites and Claraia (Zonneveld, 2001; Zonneveld et al., 2007; Zonneveld et al., 2010)
In the Montney Formation, the paucity of biodiversity during the Lower Triassic is striking, with few limited species like Unionites and Claraia (Zonneveld, 2001; Zonneveld et al., 2007; Zonneveld et al., 2010)In addition, ammonoids and fish remains are also present as well as microfossils indicating healthy sea surface conditions
Such prolific shell production and deposition may have prevailed during the Lower Triassic in the WCSB (Fig26).
Low species diversity in an extensive shallow shelf produced bioclastic-rich deposits during the Lower TriassicHigh initial porosity combined with metastable mineral compositions of the bioclasts (aragonite, high Mg-calcite, biogenic silica) increased early diagenetic alteration processes during burial (Fig
Unfortunately, little core material is available from the eastern Triassic coastlineSub-unit CS1b contains cm-thick beds, some containing inclined angles, convolute or wavy sediment textures
Biogenic silica from siliceous tests presents an ideal and easy source for silica and silicate mineral growth during diagenesis (Chang et al., 1998; Milliken et al., 2016) and at the end of the Triassic, over 150 radiolarian species were present in the NE Panthalassic Ocean (Carter and Hori, 2005)Interestingly, Na is in close relationship with Si and both are dissimilar to Ca, Mg, and Sr, which are the typical carbonate
This study focused on the lower units CS1 and CS2, which were deposited during the Lower Triassic Period (Induan Stage)Units CS1a and CS2 have similar chemostratigraphic patterns, while CS1b exhibits elevated elemental and elemental ratio fluctuations
