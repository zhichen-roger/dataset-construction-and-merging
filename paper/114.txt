Detrital zircon record of thrust belt unroofi ng in Lower Cretaceous synorogenic conglomerates, central UtahTimothy F
U-Pb detrital zircon (DZ) ages (n = 807) from Lower Cretaceous and lowermost Upper Cretaceous synorogenic conglomerate and interbedded sandstone deposited in and near the foredeep of the Cordilleran foreland basin in central Utah indicate stratigraphic compositional variation among the depositsEight DZ age populations, ranging from Archean through Mesozoic, are present in the synorogenic foredeep deposits in varying proportions and permit defi nition of three compositional suites, termed here chronofacies
Eight DZ age populations, ranging from Archean through Mesozoic, are present in the synorogenic foredeep deposits in varying proportions and permit defi nition of three compositional suites, termed here chronofaciesChronofacies A, present in uppermost Neocomian–lowermost Aptian foredeep deposits, contains Archean through early Paleozoic DZ grains derived from Jurassic–Pennsylvanian strata of the thrust belt
Chronofacies A, present in uppermost Neocomian–lowermost Aptian foredeep deposits, contains Archean through early Paleozoic DZ grains derived from Jurassic–Pennsylvanian strata of the thrust beltChronofacies B, in Aptian–Albian foredeep deposits, contains Archean and Paleoproterozoic grains with an age peak near 1850 Ma, a population distribution similar to that of lower Paleozoic quartzites of the thrust belt
Chronofacies B, in Aptian–Albian foredeep deposits, contains Archean and Paleoproterozoic grains with an age peak near 1850 Ma, a population distribution similar to that of lower Paleozoic quartzites of the thrust beltChronofacies C, in Albian–lower Cenomanian foredeep deposits, contains a trimodal population distribution of Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic grains similar to that of Cambrian–Neoproterozoic quartzite strata of the thrust belt
Chronofacies C, in Albian–lower Cenomanian foredeep deposits, contains a trimodal population distribution of Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic grains similar to that of Cambrian–Neoproterozoic quartzite strata of the thrust beltThe chronofacies of the foredeep deposits thus record systematic erosional unroofi ng of the thrust belt during Early Cretaceous time.

We include in our source unit data published analyses from the Ordovician Eureka and Valmy Formations of central Nevada (Gehrels and Dickinson, 1995) and the Jurassic Nugget Sandstone in the Nebo thrust sheet (CP3; Dickinson and Gehrels, 2009).Zircon grain separation employed standard magnetic and dense-liquid techniques

Broad age spans in Archean, Paleoproterozoic, and Mesoproterozoic populations result from generally large analytical errors for grains older than 1000 Ma relative to grains younger than 1000 Ma (e.g., Gehrels, 2000) (Table DR1).Signifi cantly, not all eight grain age populations are present in each foredeep sample; more-
three such population suites, termed chronofacies A–C: (1) Chronofacies A contains a spread of Paleoproterozoic grains, some Archean grains, and groups of grains in the Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic (samples UT06-8A and -8B, UT07-10 and -16); (2) chronofacies B contains rare Grenville grains, a prominent group of Paleoproterozoic grains with a peak near 1850 Ma, and Archean grains (samples UT06-4, UT07-9 and -15); (3) chronofacies C contains three prominent Proterozoic grain populations with peaks near 1750 Ma, 1450 Ma, and 1140 Ma (samples UT06-3, UT07-11 and -14)Some samples in chronofacies A also contain
Mesozoic grains (samples UT06-8B and UT0716)Most samples have prominent populations of Grenville grains, which are present in almost all Proterozoic quartzite formations of western North America (e.g., Stewart et al., 2001) (Fig
Most samples have prominent populations of Grenville grains, which are present in almost all Proterozoic quartzite formations of western North America (e.g., Stewart et al., 2001) (Fig3); therefore it is noteworthy that Grenville grains are rare in Cedar Mountain samples (UT06-4 and UT07-15, Fig
Proterozoic through Mesozoic strata in the thrust belt can be divided into three distinctive provenance intervals with DZ age populations that generally correspond to those of the synorogenic unitsThree samples, representing Pennsylvanian–Jurassic sandstones of the thrust belt, strongly resemble the DZ age distribution of chronofacies A (Fig
Three samples, representing Pennsylvanian–Jurassic sandstones of the thrust belt, strongly resemble the DZ age distribution of chronofacies A (Fig3; Table DR2)
Analyses of Ordovician sandstones from central Nevada (Gehrels and Dickinson, 1995) contain Archean grains and a prominent Paleoproterozoic group with an age peak near 1850 Ma, similar to the grain age distributions observed in the synorogenic Cedar Mountain samplesThe Proterozoic Caddy Canyon Quartzite and Lower Cambrian Prospect Mountain Quartzite have a distinctive trimodal Proterozoic DZ age distribution matching that of chronofacies C in the two youngest synorogenic conglomerate samples

prior to widespread exposure of Proterozoic and lowermost Paleozoic strata in the thrust belt, because those source units contain abundant Grenville grains, which are scarce in chronofacies BChronofacies B deposits in the foreland therefore record intermediate erosion of the thrust belt down to strata of the lower to middle Paleozoic.

Provenance interval C includes Neoproterozoic and lowermost Paleozoic quartzites in the thrust belt, with a prominent trimodal population of Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic grain agesChronofacies C deposits in the foredeep, with a similar age distribution and typically composed exclusively of quartzite clasts, thus indicate widespread exposure of Proterozoic quartzite strata in the thrust belt.
Chronofacies C deposits in the foredeep, with a similar age distribution and typically composed exclusively of quartzite clasts, thus indicate widespread exposure of Proterozoic quartzite strata in the thrust belt.The use of DZ chronofacies has the potential to better defi ne exposure gates in thrust sheets and document their along-strike variability in thrust orogens
For example, Proterozoic quartzite clasts have been reported from the basal Cedar Mountain Conglomerate, a representative of chronofacies B in Salina Canyon (section 2, Fig4) (Currie, 2002)
The conglomerate also contains upper Paleozoic chert clasts and clasts of silicifi ed wood likely derived from Triassic strataThe absence of Grenville zircons in this conglomerate indicates that Proterozoic or Lower Cambrian strata were not yet unroofed in the Sevier orogenic belt and precludes the scenario that the whole preorogenic section, roughly 16,000 m of strata, was exposed when the lowermost preserved synorogenic conglomerate was deposited.

The synorogenic deposits have eight discrete DZ age populations ranging in age from Archean through MesozoicThese grain age populations
