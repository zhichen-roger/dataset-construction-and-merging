U–Pb ages on detrital zircons and geochemistry of Lula paragneiss from Variscan belt, NE Sardinia, Italy: implications for source rocks and early Paleozoic paleogeographyGabriele CruCiani (1), MarCello FranCesChelli (1), Valeria Caironi (2) & GioVanni MusuMeCi (3)
Chemical analyses of garnet-bearing metasediments and EMP and U/Pb analyses of detrital zircons of the Lula paragneisses in the Axial Zone of the Variscan belt (NE Sardinia) give significant contribution to the reconstruction of the early Paleozoic evolution of the northern Gondwana marginThe youngest middle Ordovician (465 Ma) age of detrital zircons indicate a derivation from a forearc sedimentary basin along an early Paleozoic convergent margin, which collected sediments from nearby emerged lands consisting of early Paleozoic volcanic arcs and pre-Paleozoic sequences
The youngest middle Ordovician (465 Ma) age of detrital zircons indicate a derivation from a forearc sedimentary basin along an early Paleozoic convergent margin, which collected sediments from nearby emerged lands consisting of early Paleozoic volcanic arcs and pre-Paleozoic sequencesThe chemical composition of metasediments is characterized by negative Sr anomaly and depletion in heavy rare earth elements (HREE) and Y as compared to the upper crust
This fit well with derivation of early Paleozoic metasedimentary formations in southern Sardinia and northern Apennine, pointing out a common origin and location of these sedimentary basins along the northern margin of Gondwana at the early PaleozoicAs regards the Variscan orogeny, the common middle Ordovician age of Lula paragneiss and nearby Lodé orthogneiss highlight the role of Variscan tectonics in the assembly of different blocks of early-middle Paleozoic margin.

Large parts of the southern Europe Variscan chain derive from the so-called peri-Gondwanan terranes, a mosaic of continental blocks that rifted away from the northern Gondwana margin as a consequence of the opening of the Rheic Ocean in the Early Ordovician (aViGad et alii, 2012 and reference therein)Some of these terranes (i.e
Pyrenees) experienced early to middle-late Ordovician magmatism, respectively related to the opening of Rheic Ocean (Murphy et alii, 2006; nanCe et alii, 2010) and to an Andean-type volcanic arc and/or subduction-accretion margin (oGGiano et alii, 2010; CruCiani et alii, 2019a)In some places deposition of clastic sedimentary sequences was coeval with Ordovician magmatism
In some places deposition of clastic sedimentary sequences was coeval with Ordovician magmatismThe current level of erosion exposes large volumes of low to medium-high grade metamorphic rocks (i.e
metavolcanic, metarkose, metasandstone, orthogneiss, paragneiss) derived from middle-late Ordovician magmatic or sedimentary rocks from inner to the outer zones of the Variscan chainThus, these rocks, and their geochemical composition, represent very important records of geological history that allow to better understand the evolution of Gondwana, and peri- Gondwanan terranes at that time (Fernandez - suarez et alii, 2000; TroMbeTTa et alii, 2004; aViGad et alii, 2012).
In order to reconstruct the Early Paleozoic evolution of the Sardinian block and give additional data for paleogeographic reconstructions of peri-Gondwanan terranes, we have undertaken a geochemical and radiometric study of paragneisses (Lula paragneiss) exposed in the inner zone of the Variscan belt in NE SardiniaSuch rocks have been regarded as the host rocks of middle Ordovician granitoids (Lodé-Mamone orthogneiss; CarMiGnani et alii, 1994 and reference therein)
Such rocks have been regarded as the host rocks of middle Ordovician granitoids (Lodé-Mamone orthogneiss; CarMiGnani et alii, 1994 and reference therein)The geochemical and radiometric data allow to shed some ligth on the origin of the Lula paragneiss and on the tectonic setting of sedimentary basins and acidic magmatism in the Early Paleozoic
The geochemical and radiometric data allow to shed some ligth on the origin of the Lula paragneiss and on the tectonic setting of sedimentary basins and acidic magmatism in the Early PaleozoicMoreover, on the basis of detrital zircon ages, a comparison with other Early Paleozoic clastic sequences in Sardinia and northern Apennine Paleozoic basement allows to make some considerations about the paleogeographic reconstruction of these peri-Gondwanan terranes in the early Paleozoic.
Moreover, on the basis of detrital zircon ages, a comparison with other Early Paleozoic clastic sequences in Sardinia and northern Apennine Paleozoic basement allows to make some considerations about the paleogeographic reconstruction of these peri-Gondwanan terranes in the early Paleozoic.The Sardinian basement consists of Cambrian to Lower Carboniferous metamorphic sequences and Late Carboniferous to Permian igneous rocks, in turn covered by Carboniferous-Permian sedimentary rocks and Permian volcanics (CarMiGnani et alii, 1994, 2001; barCa et alii, 1995)
The Sardinian basement consists of Cambrian to Lower Carboniferous metamorphic sequences and Late Carboniferous to Permian igneous rocks, in turn covered by Carboniferous-Permian sedimentary rocks and Permian volcanics (CarMiGnani et alii, 1994, 2001; barCa et alii, 1995)Since the 90’s, the Sardinian metamorphic basement has been classically subdivided into the following four tectono-metamorphic zones from SW to NE (Fig
The External Zone, in southern Sulcis, consists of a Cambro-Ordovician sequence that, from bottom to top, includes the MtFilau orthogneiss, Monte Settiballas schists and Bithia Unit (paVaneTTo et alii, 2102; CosTaMaGna et alii, 2016; CruCiani et alii, 2019a)
In the Iglesiente, the Paleozoic sequence is composed of the Cambrian siliciclastic to carbonate deposits of the Nebida, Gonnesa and Iglesias Group (pillola et alii, 1995) separated by the Sardic unconformity from the overlying siliciclastic sequence related to the sinking of the passive margin(leone et alii, 1991), whose age is Late Ordovician to Early Carboniferous.
(leone et alii, 1991), whose age is Late Ordovician to Early Carboniferous.The Nappe Zone, in turn subdived into Internal and External Nappe Zone, results from southward thrusting with km-scale isoclinal folding and syntectonic regional metamorphism ranging from lower greenschist to amphibolite facies conditions (CarMiGnani et alii, 1994; CruCiani et alii, 2016)
The lithostratigraphic successions in the Nappe Zone consist of Upper Cambrian to Lower Carboniferous metasedimentary rocks with Middle–Upper Ordovician and Lower Silurian calc-alkaline (oGGiano et alii, 2010; CruCiani et alii, 2013a; MusuMeCi et alii, 2015) and alkaline meta-igneous rocksIn the External Nappe Zone crops out a thick Middle to Upper Ordovician volcanosedimentary to epiclastic succession arranged into a southward verging stack of allochthonous nappes (ConTi et alii, 2001): Monte Grighini Unit, Rio Gruppa - Castello Medusa Unit, Gerrei Unit, Meana Sardo Unit, Sarrabus Unit and Arburese Unit.
In the External Nappe Zone crops out a thick Middle to Upper Ordovician volcanosedimentary to epiclastic succession arranged into a southward verging stack of allochthonous nappes (ConTi et alii, 2001): Monte Grighini Unit, Rio Gruppa - Castello Medusa Unit, Gerrei Unit, Meana Sardo Unit, Sarrabus Unit and Arburese Unit.The Inner Zone is formed by two metamorphic complexes: i) the Low- to Medium-Grade Metamorphic Complex (L-MGMC): micaschists (locally with HP metamorphic overprint, CruCiani et alii, 2013b), paragneisses and orthogneisses reaching amphibolitefacies conditions; ii) the High-Grade Metamorphic Complex (HGMC, or Migmatite Complex): mainly igneous and sedimentary-derived migmatites (Massonne et alii, 2013; CruCiani et alii, 2014a,b; FanCello et alii, 2018) embedding metabasite lenses with relics of granulites (sCodina et alii, 2019) and eclogites (FranCesChelli et alii, 2007; CruCiani et alii, 2019b)
According to CosTaMaGna et alii (2012), these rocks may derive from acidic and intermediate volcanics, arkosic sandstones and carbonaceous pelites: this is in good agreement with the Middle Ordovician to Silurian protolith stratigraphy of the Variscan anchimetamorphic areas of Southern Sardinia (paVaneTTo et alii, 2012; CruCiani et alii, 2018)U–Pb zircon dating of meta-igneous rocks (Lula porphyroid) enclosed in the phyllites gives an age of 474 ± 13 Ma (helbinG &
Proterozoic ages (1932 ± 11 Ma and 1845 ± 10Ma) were recorded by the main magmatic domain of crystals B36 and B8, respectivelyDiscordant ages in the same time span were found in crystals B5, A6 and A71
7e) suggests recycling of some of these Proterozoic zircons during the genesis of younger magmas.Other recycled components (1259 ± 51 and 1203 ± 52 Ma) are documented by the cores of crystals A10 and A83, both relatively enriched in Y and Hf (Fig
The paragneiss samples display, on average, lower ΣREE and slightly less pronounced negative Eu anomalies than the Sardinian Ordovician metavolcanics from Sarcidano, Sarrabus and Gerrei published by GiaCoMini et alii (2006) and GaGGero et alii (2012)However, their significant LREE enrichment, the significant negative Eu-anomalies with Eu/Eu* between ~ 0.6-0.9 and the flat HREE pattern indicate a derivation from an old upper continental crust mainly composed of felsic rocks
9d), the studied samples show affinity with post-Archean rocksIn the latter diagram, they plot very close to the Upper Continental Crust (UCC) and partially overlap with the metasandstones of the Lula area reported by CosTaMaGna et alii (2012).
The obtained ages of the detrital zircons in the paragneiss are consistent with a pre-Variscan Middle Ordovician sedimentary sequenceThis seems to contradict the suggestion that the paragneiss are a lower Paleozoic basement with a pre-Variscan deformation and metamorphism (helbinG & Tiepolo, 2005)
This seems to contradict the suggestion that the paragneiss are a lower Paleozoic basement with a pre-Variscan deformation and metamorphism (helbinG & Tiepolo, 2005)Moreover, the new U/Pb zircon ages also indicate that this metasedimentary sequence could not be the host rock of the protolith of the Lodè-Mamone orthogneiss
Thus, the Lula paragneiss likely represents a record of an early Paleozoic sedimentary basin which collected sediments from nearby emerged lands consisting of pre-Paleozoic sequences and Early Paleozoic volcanic arcThe U/Pb zircon age of 474 ± 13 Ma reported for the metavolcanics intercalated with metasediments (helbinG & Tiepolo, 2005) reinforce the suggestion that the low to medium metamorphic grade sequence exposed in northeast Sardinia corresponds to an Early Paleozoic sedimentary basin
The U/Pb zircon age of 474 ± 13 Ma reported for the metavolcanics intercalated with metasediments (helbinG & Tiepolo, 2005) reinforce the suggestion that the low to medium metamorphic grade sequence exposed in northeast Sardinia corresponds to an Early Paleozoic sedimentary basinThis attribution fits well with the suggestion that (i) this sequence experienced a unique Variscan orogenic cycle (CarMiGnani et alii, 1994; FranCesChelli et alii, 2005) and (ii) a Precambrian basement is absent in the Paleozoic sequence of Sardinian Variscan belt as suggested by CruCiani et alii (2019a)
This attribution fits well with the suggestion that (i) this sequence experienced a unique Variscan orogenic cycle (CarMiGnani et alii, 1994; FranCesChelli et alii, 2005) and (ii) a Precambrian basement is absent in the Paleozoic sequence of Sardinian Variscan belt as suggested by CruCiani et alii (2019a)Therefore, two different hypotheses can be made regarding the Ordovician tectonic setting: if we consider the Ordovician magmatism developed as an Andean-type magmatic arc, the Lula paragneiss and Lodé orthogneiss would correspond to fore-arc basin and deep portion of magmatic arc, respectively
Therefore, two different hypotheses can be made regarding the Ordovician tectonic setting: if we consider the Ordovician magmatism developed as an Andean-type magmatic arc, the Lula paragneiss and Lodé orthogneiss would correspond to fore-arc basin and deep portion of magmatic arc, respectivelyOtherwise if we consider the hypothesis of a middle Ordovician magmatic arc in a subduction-accretionary margin, (“early Paleozoic subduction-accretionary complex”; zurbriGGen, 2015; CruCiani et alii, 2019a), the Lula paragneiss derives from the part of a Middle Ordovician accretionary wedge located along the northern Gondwana margin (Cenerian Belt; zurbriGGen, 2015, zurbriGGen et alii, 1997)
Otherwise if we consider the hypothesis of a middle Ordovician magmatic arc in a subduction-accretionary margin, (“early Paleozoic subduction-accretionary complex”; zurbriGGen, 2015; CruCiani et alii, 2019a), the Lula paragneiss derives from the part of a Middle Ordovician accretionary wedge located along the northern Gondwana margin (Cenerian Belt; zurbriGGen, 2015, zurbriGGen et alii, 1997)In this interpretation the Lodé orthogneiss constitutes the deep portion of the magmatic arc itself emplaced within the accretionary wedge, as suggested by CruCiani et alii (2019a) for the Monte Filau Ortogneiss in SW Varican belt of Sardinia
Regardless of their interpretation the Lodé orthogneiss and Lula paragneiss were deformed under amphibolites facies conditions and stacked in the Variscan nappe pile during the late Carboniferous D2 phase.The ages obtained in the present study on the zircon population of the paragneiss sample L214 are compared with the radiometric age determinations available in literature for similar rocks from Variscan Sardinia and from the Paleozoic Tuscan metamorphic basement (Table 2).
The ages obtained in the present study on the zircon population of the paragneiss sample L214 are compared with the radiometric age determinations available in literature for similar rocks from Variscan Sardinia and from the Paleozoic Tuscan metamorphic basement (Table 2).A quartz-arenite of the Cabitza Formation (IglesienteSulcis, Sardinia) gave U-Pb zircon ages in the 500 Ma-2.5 Ga range (paVaneTTo et alii, 2012) with three main peaks at 647 Ma, 850 Ma and 1 Ga

The Calamita Schist in the Elba island reveals age distribution from Proterozoic to early Paleozoic ages(early Cambrian; sireVaaG et alii, 2016), with the youngest igneous zircons dated at middle-late Ordovician (MusuMeCi et alii, 2011).
(early Cambrian; sireVaaG et alii, 2016), with the youngest igneous zircons dated at middle-late Ordovician (MusuMeCi et alii, 2011).Considering the wide range of ages recorded by the detrital zircons in the above mentioned lithological units, a long history emerges with several episodes of both magmatic activity and erosion-sedimentation cycles along the northern margin of Gondwana (WilliaMs et alii, 2012)
The comparison with the other metasedimentary formations of the early Paleozoic basement in Sardinia and Tuscany (Table 2), outlines a similarity of records of the Lula paragneiss with the Cabitza and Bithia formations as regards the contribution of zircons of Cambrian, Neo and Mesoproterozoic ageFurthermore, a similarity also occurs with the upper Quartzites-Phyllites formation and the Buti Quartzites–Phyllites (Tuscan Paleozoic basement) for the Cambrian and Neoproterozoic ages, but not for the Greenvillian ones.
Furthermore, a similarity also occurs with the upper Quartzites-Phyllites formation and the Buti Quartzites–Phyllites (Tuscan Paleozoic basement) for the Cambrian and Neoproterozoic ages, but not for the Greenvillian ones.It could be hypothesized that they represent different portions, probably contiguous or in lateral continuity, of the same continental margin, with a similar and/ or common detrital contribution at least by the Neoproterozoic (Panafrican - Cryogenian) and partly also for the Mesoproterozoic (Greenvillian)
It could be hypothesized that they represent different portions, probably contiguous or in lateral continuity, of the same continental margin, with a similar and/ or common detrital contribution at least by the Neoproterozoic (Panafrican - Cryogenian) and partly also for the Mesoproterozoic (Greenvillian)According to the suggestion of aViGad et alii (2012) for the Cabitza formation, on the basis of similar content of Cambrian and Neoproterozoic detrital zircons, a derivation of the Lula paragneiss from Pan-African terranes along the northern Gondwana margin can be proposed.
According to the suggestion of aViGad et alii (2012) for the Cabitza formation, on the basis of similar content of Cambrian and Neoproterozoic detrital zircons, a derivation of the Lula paragneiss from Pan-African terranes along the northern Gondwana margin can be proposed.Moreover, the occurrence of Greenvillian zircons in metasediments of the SW Sardinia early Paleozoic basement (i.e
Moreover, the occurrence of Greenvillian zircons in metasediments of the SW Sardinia early Paleozoic basement (i.eCabitza and Bithia formations) and the Lula paragneiss could indicate a contribution from the Sahara craton and/or the Arabian-Numidian shield (Fig
Similar deductions were also proposed for the Calabria–Peloritani Terrane of Southern Italy, where some pre-Cambrian sediments derive from East and West African sources and the Ordovician sediments reflect erosion of Pan-African orogen and local input from Grenvillian terrains (Fornelli et alii, 2016).The geochemical data and U–Pb analyses of zircon of some samples of Lula paragneiss from tectonic domains in the axial zone of Variscan belt in northern Sardinia,
contribute to the knowledge of peri-Gondwanan evolution from Late-Proterozoic to early Paleozoic times.The new data provide evidence of the following geological processes:
The source rocks of the Lula paragneiss derive from an early-Paleozoic sedimentary basin which collected sediments from the nearby pre-Paleozoic sequences and early Paleozoic volcanic arc.The deposition age of the sedimentary protolith, similar to the emplacement age of Lodé orthogneiss, indicates that the Lula paragneiss derives from a forearc basin in an Ordovician active convergent margin (Andean-type or subduction-accretion margin)
The deposition age of the sedimentary protolith, similar to the emplacement age of Lodé orthogneiss, indicates that the Lula paragneiss derives from a forearc basin in an Ordovician active convergent margin (Andean-type or subduction-accretion margin)This suggestion contradicts previous interpretation of the Lula paragneiss as host rock of the Lodé orthogneiss and highlights the role of Variscan tectonics in the assembly of different blocks deriving from the earlymiddle Paleozoic margin.
This suggestion contradicts previous interpretation of the Lula paragneiss as host rock of the Lodé orthogneiss and highlights the role of Variscan tectonics in the assembly of different blocks deriving from the earlymiddle Paleozoic margin.The REE pattern of the paragneiss, with LREE enrichment, negative Eu-anomaly and flat HREE, suggests a derivation from an old upper continental crust mainly made up of felsic rocks
This fits well with similar proposed derivation of early Paleozoic metasedimentary formations in southern Sardinia and northern Apennine, pointing out a common location of these sedimentary basins along the northern margin of Gondwana at the early Paleozoic times.We are grateful to one anonymous reviewer and to Annamaria Fornelli who helped to improve the original manuscript
