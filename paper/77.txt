Gas venting triggered by overpressure in contact aureoles within shale has been proposed to have caused global climate changes in the end-Permian, Early Jurassic (Toarcian), and at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary (Svensen et al., 2004, 2007, 2009).The aim of this study is to understand the formation of sandstone intrusions in dolerite sills
The sediments were deposited from the late Carboniferous to the Middle Jurassic, in an environment ranging from dominantly marine (the Dwyka and Ecca Groups) to fl uvial (theBeaufort Group and parts of the Stormberg Group) and eolian (upper part of the Stormberg Group) (Catuneanu et al., 1998; Veevers et al., 1994)
Both southern Africa and Antarctica underwent extensive volcanic activity in early Jurassic times, starting ca182.5 Ma
The intruded sediments are mainly sandstones, all from the Permian and Triassic Beaufort GroupAn overview of the locality is given in Figure 2A
