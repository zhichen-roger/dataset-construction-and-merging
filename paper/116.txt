The southerly derived sedimentary strata also include Archaean and Proterozoic zircon age spectra consistent with a Dalradian sourceA southern provenance from the Notre Dame arc and Dalradian rocks suggests that the Connemara terrane lay to the south of the South Mayo Trough during middle Llanvirn times, from at least 464 Ma.
Successions preserved in eastern North America indicate that Cambrian to early Ordovician oceanic volcanic arcs and suprasubduction ophiolites were obducted and accreted onto Laurentia (Baie Verte Oceanic Tract), followed by subduction-polarity flip and development of the 488–456 Ma Notre Dame magmatic arc within the Laurentian accretionary margin (van Staal et al1998, and references therein)
A similar history of successive Ordovician magmatic arcs is evident in western Ireland (Ryan & Dewey 1991; Dewey 2005)Early Ordovician, oceanward-directed subduction formed the Lough Nafooey oceanic volcanic arc (Figs 1 and 3; Clift & Ryan 1994; Chew et al
Early Ordovician, oceanward-directed subduction formed the Lough Nafooey oceanic volcanic arc (Figs 1 and 3; Clift & Ryan 1994; Chew et al2007); this arc and the associated South Mayo Trough fore-arc basin collided with the Laurentian margin from c
475–462 Ma magmatic arc intrusions within the Neoproterozoic metasedimentary sequence (Dalradian) of the deforming Laurentian margin (Leake 1989; Friedrich et al1999a).
Although there is evidence that it occurred before deposition of the late Ordovician or early Silurian Derryveeny conglomerate (Graham et al1991; Fig
In this paper we present the results of a study of Ordovician rocks in the South Mayo Trough that combines detrital zircon analysis with conglomerate-clast petrology and geochemistry, building on an established geological base (e.gPudsey 1984a,b; Long et al
The Ordovician rocks of South Mayo were folded into a large synclinorium before late Llandovery deposition of unconformable Silurian sedimentary sequences, and the north and south limbs preserve different aspects of pre-Mweelrea Formation geological historyTo the south, the Lough Nafooey Group and Tourmakeady Volcanic Succession (Figs 2 and 3) record magmatism in a north-facing, peri-Laurentian volcanic arc (Clift & Ryan 1994)
It has been generally believed that Connemara arrived in its outboard position to the south of the South Mayo Trough by post-460 Ma strike-slip terrane amalgamation, to provide a southern sediment source of metamorphic clasts for the late Ordovician or early Silurian Derryveeny Formation (Hutton 1987; Graham et al1991)
Silurian rocks unconformably overlie and obscure the northern and southern margins of the South Mayo Trough so that contacts with the Connemara block and the Clew Bay Complex are not exposedTiming of pre-Silurian folding of the South Mayo Trough sedimentary rocks, including the Mweelrea Formation, could be late Grampian or an otherwise unrecognized event occurring between the Grampian and Acadian orogenies
Timing of pre-Silurian folding of the South Mayo Trough sedimentary rocks, including the Mweelrea Formation, could be late Grampian or an otherwise unrecognized event occurring between the Grampian and Acadian orogeniesIf Grampian, the 462.5  1.2 Ma age of the late- to post-D4 Oughterard Granite (Friedrich et al
1999a) places a minimum age limit on the first folding of the South Mayo Ordovician rocksHarper & Parkes (2000) have proposed a Caradoc age for faunas in the upper (Glenconnelly) slate member of the Mweelrea Formation, at the centre of the Mweelrea Syncline (Fig

Treating the Cambrian and Ordovician grains (n ¼ 42) as a subset of the total population yields a high frequency-probability and median TuffZirc age of c486 Ma (Fig

The abundance of late Cambrian–early Ordovician zircons suggests that felsic intrusions like the Baie Verte trondhjemites and tonalites were present in the ophiolitePlagiogranite clasts in the basal Silurian conglomerate unconformably overlying the South Mayo Trough sedimentary rocks, dated at c

Ordovician zircon ages from sandstones at Bunnacunneen are in general younger than those from Bundorragha and Derrintin LoughOrdovician maxima for Bunnacunneen samples (Figs 7 and 8) correspond to the age of ignimbrites in the Mweelrea Formation (c
Ordovician maxima for Bunnacunneen samples (Figs 7 and 8) correspond to the age of ignimbrites in the Mweelrea Formation (c464 Ma, Dewey & Mange 1999), the age range of the Connemara magmatic arc (c
The observation that the upper Bunnacunneen sample has an older Ordovician maximum than the basal sample is considered to represent unroofing of the Connemara–Notre Dame arc and concomitant supply of material containing older zircons.The Archaean and Proterozoic grains in all samples are consistent with a Laurentian source (Cawood et al
The Archaean and Proterozoic grains in all samples are consistent with a Laurentian source (Cawood et al2007)
2003) and, although not diagnostic, a Dalradian source is likely for the Archaean and Proterozoic zircons in the Mweelrea Formation, including those with southern provenanceFirst-cycle derivation of zircon from more distal Archaean and Grenville source areas is possible for the northerly and easterly sourced detritus, but such sources are not known to the south.
(2003) on geochemical grounds to have been derived from Precambrian granites in the Laurentian margin, consistent with palaeocurrent evidence presented by Williams (2002)Previously, Archer (1977) had suggested a southern volcanic arc source, but the more recent evidence, including that presented here, indicates that the Rosroe granite clasts are not related to those in the Bunnacunneen conglomerate.
Sedimentary strata of the lower Mweelrea Formation of the South Mayo Trough include two age-distinct Ordovician source rock components that correspond to different volcanic arc phases on the Laurentian margin; the Cambrian to early Ordovician Baie Verte Oceanic Tract arc–ophiolite complex to the north and the mid-Ordovician Notre Dame arc to the southBoth groups also include late Archaean and Proterozoic zircon age spectra that correlate with the Laurentian signature found in Dalradian metasedimentary rocks
Both groups also include late Archaean and Proterozoic zircon age spectra that correlate with the Laurentian signature found in Dalradian metasedimentary rocksThe southern provenance from a terrane with Notre Dame arc and Laurentian signatures suggests that the Connemara terrane lay to the south of the South Mayo Trough during middle Ordovician times.
The southern provenance from a terrane with Notre Dame arc and Laurentian signatures suggests that the Connemara terrane lay to the south of the South Mayo Trough during middle Ordovician times.The U–Pb zircon age of 470.6  1.0 Ma, the geochemical similarity of the Bunnacunneen granite clasts to the Connemara granitic orthogneisses, and the southerly position of the orthogneisses and the likely southerly derivation of the clasts, suggest that rocks related to the orthogneiss suite were the source of the clasts
We propose that Connemara lay to the south of the South Mayo Trough from about 464 Ma, significantly earlier than deposition of the late Ordovician or early Silurian Derryveeny Formation, previously the earliest recognized evidence for a southern Connemara source (Graham et al1991)
Our detrital zircon data show that the northerly ophiolite included Cambro-Ordovician igneous rocks, and so is age-equivalent to the Baie Verte Oceanic Tract of Newfoundland (van Staal et al1998)
1998) and later post-Silurian brittle fracturing (Power et al2002), the main fabrics in the syntectonic Connemara arc intrusions and the D4 shear zones in Connemara are sinistral (Long et al
(2003) that Connemara was a southerly sediment source for the late Ordovician–Silurian Derryveeny conglomerate, but not for the Llanvirn Rosroe Formation, which underlies the Mweelrea Formation (Fig2)
