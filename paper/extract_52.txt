The Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous Monteith Formation (Minnes Group) records incipient foredeep deposition in the Deep Basin of northwestern Alberta and British ColumbiaThe uppermost lithostratigraphic unit of the Monteith Formation, informally referred to as the Monteith A, is investigated with data from 550 wells, which includes wireline log suites from each well and approximately 540 m of core from 29 wells, across a 17,500 km2 area (T58–72, R6-20W6M)

The basin was oriented southeast to northwest and paralleled a developing orogen to its west that was created as allochthonous terranes accreted onto the North American Plate in the early to middle Jurassic (Poulton et al., 1994; Evenchick et al., 2007)The deposits are postulated to be the northern extension of a continent-scale Jurassic drainage network (Fig

Outcrops of the late Jurassic Morrison Formation, Utah offer a comparison and test of the methods used to interpret the stratigraphic architecture of the Monteith Formation for numerous reasons: 1) Stratigraphic subdivisions within both formations are broadly comparable, with the base of mappable units placed beneath coarse-grained intervals and correlated based upon A/S regime (Figs9C, 10C and 12); 2) The thickness of each mappable unit is also comparable, ranging from 25 m to 65 m in both formations; 3) Channel-belt dimensions are also similar with lateral accretion deposits in the Morrison Formation 8.1 m thick and 2006 m wide on average, as compared to an estimated 8.5 m thick and 1527 m wide in the Monteith Formation (Figs

The late Jurassic-early Cretaceous strata of the Monteith Formation (Monteith A) are characterized by variable fluvial channel-belt architecture and dimensions, both spatially and stratigraphicallyCharacterization of the strata with only wireline logs and core is possible with an integrated sedimentologic and theoretical approach, which estimates channel-belts 514–2851 m wide and 4.1–12.6 m deep
