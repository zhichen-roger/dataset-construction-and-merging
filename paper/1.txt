The Xiukang Mélange of the Yarlung-Zangbo suture zone in south Tibet documents low efficiency of accretion along the southern active margin of Asia during Cretaceous Neotethyan subduction, followed by final development during the early Paleogene stages of the India–Asia collisionHere we present integrated petrologic, U– Pb detrital-zircon geochronology and Hf isotope data on different types of sandstone blocks in the Xiukang Mélange
Blocks of turbiditic quartzarenite originally sourced from the Indian continent were deposited in pre-Cretaceous time on the northernmost edge of the Indian passive margin and eventually involved into the mélange at the early stage of the India–Asia collisionTwo distinct groups of volcaniclastic-sandstone blocks were derived from the central Lhasa block and Gangdese magmatic arc
One group was deposited in the trench and/or on the trench slope of the Asian margin during the early Late Cretaceous, and the other group in a syn-collisional basin just after the onset of the India–Asia collision in the Early EoceneThe largely erosional character of the Asian active margin in the Late Cretaceous is indicated by the scarcity of off-scraped trench-fill deposits and the relatively small subduction complex developed during limited episodes of accretion
The largely erosional character of the Asian active margin in the Late Cretaceous is indicated by the scarcity of off-scraped trench-fill deposits and the relatively small subduction complex developed during limited episodes of accretionThe Xiukang Mélange was finally structured in the Late Paleocene/Eocene, when sandstone blocks of both Indian and Asian origin were progressively incorporated tectonically in the suture zone of the nascent Himalayan Orogen.

Northward subduction of the Neotethyan Ocean during the Cretaceous produced an arc-trench system including the Gangdese arc, the Xigaze forearc basin floored by the Yarlung-Zangbo ophiolite, and a small subduction complex and subduction channel presently documented as part of the mélange zone (Fig1)
More recently, it was subdivided into the Dazhuqu and Bainang terranes, interpreted to represent the subduction complex of an intra-oceanic island arc fed by Tethyan oceanic rocks during the Cretaceous (Aitchison et al., 2000; Ziabrev et al., 2004; Aitchison et al., 2007)The type section is exposed around the Xiukang–
Sandstone blocks were dated by detrital-zircon U–Pb geochronology as Late Cretaceous (~71 Ma) and interpreted to have been accreted before deposition of the overlying, uppermost Cretaceous Rongmawa Formation which records transition from lower abyssal plain to upper trench sedimentation (Cai et al., 2012)The subsequent syn-collisional evolution of the Xiukang Mélange was scarcely considered, although syn-collisional sediments interpreted to be foreland-basin deposits have been reported in the Renbu area, ~170 km east of our study area (G.W
2), and on northern Tethyan Himalaya quartzarenites of the Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous Weimei Formation, found in fault contact with the Xiukang Mélange and studied here for comparisonThe results allowed us to determine the provenance and depositional age of three different groups of blocks, and to demonstrate that, unlike other well studied accretionary prisms (e.g
Nankai Trough, Clift et al., 2013; Franciscan complex, Snow et al., 2010; Chugach accretionary complex, Amato et al., 2013), the Xiukang Mélange did not only experience evolution during Cretaceous Neotethyan subduction but chiefly recorded collision between the Asian active margin and the Indian passive margin in the early PaleogeneThe importance of the collisional event has never been recognized in the mélange so far.
In the northern Lhasa block, sedimentary successions are mainly Jurassic and Cretaceous in age but Triassic strata also occurIn the central Lhasa block, Permo-Carboniferous metasedimentary and Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary strata are widespread (Pan et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2011a and references therein), together with Lower Cretaceous volcanic rocks (e.g., Zenong Group, Zhu et al., 2011a) and Mesozoic plutonic rocks dated between 215 and 95 Ma (Pan et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2011a and references therein)
In the central Lhasa block, Permo-Carboniferous metasedimentary and Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous volcano-sedimentary strata are widespread (Pan et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2011a and references therein), together with Lower Cretaceous volcanic rocks (e.g., Zenong Group, Zhu et al., 2011a) and Mesozoic plutonic rocks dated between 215 and 95 Ma (Pan et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2011a and references therein)In the southern Lhasa block, the sedimentary cover is limited and mainly of Late Triassic–Cretaceous age (Pan et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2008, 2013); magmatic rocks include the Upper Triassic to Paleogene Gangdese arc (Schärer et al., 1984; Wen et al., 2008; Ji et al., 2009) and the Cretaceous to Tertiary non-marine Linzizong volcanic succession (Mo et al., 2008 and references therein)
In the southern Lhasa block, the sedimentary cover is limited and mainly of Late Triassic–Cretaceous age (Pan et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2008, 2013); magmatic rocks include the Upper Triassic to Paleogene Gangdese arc (Schärer et al., 1984; Wen et al., 2008; Ji et al., 2009) and the Cretaceous to Tertiary non-marine Linzizong volcanic succession (Mo et al., 2008 and references therein)Magmatic rocks emplaced from the Late Triassic to the Eocene (220–40 Ma) display distinct zircon U–Pb-age and Hf-isotope signatures: zircons with negative εHf(t) characterize the central Lhasa block, indicating presence of an ancient crust (Chu et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2011a); zircons with positive εHf(t) characterize the southern Lhasa block (Chu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007; Ji et al., 2009), suggesting a juvenile crust.
Magmatic rocks emplaced from the Late Triassic to the Eocene (220–40 Ma) display distinct zircon U–Pb-age and Hf-isotope signatures: zircons with negative εHf(t) characterize the central Lhasa block, indicating presence of an ancient crust (Chu et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2011a); zircons with positive εHf(t) characterize the southern Lhasa block (Chu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007; Ji et al., 2009), suggesting a juvenile crust.The Xigaze forearc-basin succession, exposed from Renbu in the east to Zhongba in the west over a length of ~500 km and with a maximum width of ~22 km, is traditionally subdivided into the Chongdui, Sangzugang, Ngamring, and Padana Formations, from base to top (Wang et al., 2012)
The overlying Paleogene Cuojiangding Group, exposed locally in the Zhongba County, represents the youngest stratigraphic unit documenting syn-collisional fan-deltas deposited on top of the nascent Himalayan orogenic belt (Ding et al., 2005; Orme et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2016)Sandstone lithofacies and provenance studies (Einsele et al., 1994; Dürr, 1996), supplemented by detrital-zircon U– Pb age and Hf isotopic data (Wu et al., 2010; Aitchison et al., 2011; An et al., 2014), indicate that detritus was dominantly derived from the Gangdese arc, with additional contributions from the central Lhasa block and from reworking of the Sangzugang Formation within the basin.
The generally deformed matrix is represented by upper Triassic–lower Aptian abyssal chert, siliceous mudstone and local turbidites showing N-S trending stretching lineation and top-to-south S-C fabrics (Gao and Tang, 1984; Cai et al., 2012)The occurrence of Globotruncanas within the limestone blocks suggested a post-Late Cretaceous age for the formation of the mélange (Tapponnier et al., 1981)
The occurrence of Globotruncanas within the limestone blocks suggested a post-Late Cretaceous age for the formation of the mélange (Tapponnier et al., 1981)Analyses of sandstone blocks led to infer contrasting sources: geochemical evidence favored provenance from the Indian continent (Dupuis et al., 2006), whereas petrologic and zircon U–Pb analysis indicated ages not younger than 71 Ma and origin from the Lhasa block (Cai et al., 2012; G.W
3a), are mostly bioclastic, with Middle–Late Permian crinoids and bryozoans (Fig4a), and Early Triassic, Early Jurassic and Late Cretaceous foraminifera (Tapponnier et al., 1981; Jin et al., 2015 and references therein)
4a), and Early Triassic, Early Jurassic and Late Cretaceous foraminifera (Tapponnier et al., 1981; Jin et al., 2015 and references therein)These exotic blocks have been variously interpreted to represent either remnants of seamounts within the Neotethys Ocean (Wang and Mu, 1980), or of a carbonate platform situated on the northern fringe of Gondwana (Guo et al., 1991)
Metric blocks of radiolarian chert have been identified as two groups, Middle–Upper Triassic ones with continental-margin affinity indicated by MnO/TiO2 of ~ 0.36 and Ce/Ce⁎ of ~1.15 and Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous ones with oceanic-basin affinity and MnO/TiO2 of ~1.24 and Ce/Ce⁎ of ~1.03 (Zhu et al., 2005).The Tethyan Himalaya is traditionally subdivided into northern and southern domains (Liu and Einsele, 1994; Jadoul et al., 1998), separated by the Gyirong–Kangmar thrust (Ratschbacher et al., 1994)
The southern Tethyan Himalaya is characterized by Paleozoic to Eocene shelfal carbonates and terrigenous strata (Willems et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2002), whereas the northern Tethyan Himalaya consists of corresponding outer shelf, continental slope and rise depositsThese include the Weimei Formation (Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous turbiditic quartzarenites), the Rilang Formation (Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastic sandstones with intercalated mudrocks), the Gyabula Formation (mid-Cretaceous shales and siliceous rocks) and the Chuangde Formation (Upper Cretaceous oceanic red beds) (Liu and Einsele, 1994; Hu et al., 2008)
These include the Weimei Formation (Upper Jurassic/Lower Cretaceous turbiditic quartzarenites), the Rilang Formation (Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastic sandstones with intercalated mudrocks), the Gyabula Formation (mid-Cretaceous shales and siliceous rocks) and the Chuangde Formation (Upper Cretaceous oceanic red beds) (Liu and Einsele, 1994; Hu et al., 2008)The Middle Paleocene to Eocene, largely volcaniclastic sandstones and mudrocks (e.g
The Middle Paleocene to Eocene, largely volcaniclastic sandstones and mudrocks (e.gSangdanlin and Zheya Formations in Saga, Enba and Zhaguo Formations in Tingri–Gamba) represent syncollisional deposits south of the YarlungZangbo suture zone (Ding et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2012; DeCelles et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2015b; J
Meanwhile, detritus derived from the Lhasa Block in Middle Paleocene to Eocene Tethyan Himalayan successions (Sangdanlin Formation in Saga, Enba Formation in Tingri–Gamba) indicates that no intra-oceanic arc existed within the Neotethys and that the India–Asia collision began not later than ~58 Ma in southern Tibet (Cai et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2014; JLi et al., 2015), as supported by stratigraphic evidence (Zhang et al., 2012; DeCelles et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2015)
Of the 211 usable ages obtained from three samples (10XK09, 10XK16 and 13XK05), 209 are pre-Ordovician with main peaks at 950 Ma and 514 Ma (Fig6)
Shown for comparison are data from the Lhasa block (Leier et al., 2007a, b), pre-Cretaceous Tethyan Himalaya successions (Hu et al., 2010; Cai et al., 2011; Gehrels et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011a,b; Wu et al., 2014; Du et al., 2015) and Weimei Formation (Cai et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2014; Du et al., 2015; this study)Purple bands outline two age peaks typical of the Lhasa block (1170 Ma) and India (950 Ma) (Zhu et al., 2011b).
samples (10XK01, 10XK02, 10XK05 and 10XK14), 90 are Mesozoic (64 of which are between 145 and 93 Ma) (Fig7) and 183 are older than 250 Ma
The YC1σ(2+) ages in the three samples are 132 ± 16, 127 ± 3 Ma and 94 ± 1 Ma, respectively; 69 Mesozoic zircon grains show either positive or negative εHf(t) (from −22.5 to +16.9).Group 3 sandstones are feldspatho-litho-quartzose volcaniclastic (average composition QFL = 42:18:40, QmFLt = 41:18:41) with dominantly monocrystalline, subangular to rounded quartz grains, common feldspars (plagioclase N K-feldspar), and mostly microlitic to felsitic volcanic and minor sedimentary and low-rank metamorphic lithic fragments (Fig
Among the 232 valid ages obtained from two sandstone blocks (10XK06 and 13XK03), 43 are Paleogene, 106 Cretaceous, 24 Jurassic or Triassic, and 59 pre-Mesozoic and as old as 2649 Ma (Fig7)
The YC1σ(2+) ages in the three samples are 98.2 ± 1.0, 59.3 ± 0.8 Ma and 54.5 ± 0.6 Ma, respectively; 71 zircon grains of Paleogene and Mesozoic age show either positive or negative εHf(t) (from −14.4 to +16.4).The Weimei quartzarenite (average composition QFL = 87:6:7, QmFLt = 87:6:7) consists of mainly angular to subrounded monocrystalline quartz, with a few feldspars and lithic fragments
Of the 71 concordant ages obtained from sample 13QM03, 70 are pre-Ordovician with a main peak at 537 Ma (Fig6)
In this section, U–Pb age spectra and εHf(t) values of detrital zircons are compared to the patterns shown by all potential sources (including the central and southern Lhasa blocks, the Xigaze forearc basin, the Langjiexue Group, lower Paleogene syncollisional deposits, and Tethyan Himalaya strata) and used as fingerprints to robustly interpret provenance of Group 1, 2, and 3 sandstonesSandstone petrology provides crucial complementary information to independently constrain our provenance inferences.
In the central Lhasa block, Mesozoic magmatic activity took place mostly in the 230–180 Ma and 140–100 Ma time windows, peaking at around 110 Ma (Zhu et al., 2011a and references therein)Most (~75 percent) zircons in igneous rocks display negative εHf(t) values, with Hf crustal model ages (TCDM) of 2.1–1.4 Ga (Chu et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2011a)
Detrital zircons in the Cretaceous sedimentary succession yield ages between 140 and 105 Ma, with a peak at 120 Ma (Leier et al., 2007a, b)Detrital zircons in Paleozoic strata yield ages in the 500–600 Ma range with a peak at 540 Ma, and in the 1050–1300 Ma range with a peak at 1170 Ma (Zhu et al., 2011a and references therein).
Detrital zircons in Paleozoic strata yield ages in the 500–600 Ma range with a peak at 540 Ma, and in the 1050–1300 Ma range with a peak at 1170 Ma (Zhu et al., 2011a and references therein).In the southern Lhasa block, magmatic rocks emplaced between the Late Triassic and the Eocene (220–40 Ma) display positive εHf(t) and Hf crustal model ages (TC)DM of 1.0–0.3 Ga (Chu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007; Ji et al., 2009).
In the southern Lhasa block, magmatic rocks emplaced between the Late Triassic and the Eocene (220–40 Ma) display positive εHf(t) and Hf crustal model ages (TC)DM of 1.0–0.3 Ga (Chu et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007; Ji et al., 2009).Detrital zircons in Cretaceous volcaniclastic turbidites of the Xigaze forearc basin, sourced from the Gangdese arc and the central Lhasa block, display diverse patterns (Wu et al., 2010; Aitchison et al., 2011; An et al., 2014)
Detrital zircons in Cretaceous volcaniclastic turbidites of the Xigaze forearc basin, sourced from the Gangdese arc and the central Lhasa block, display diverse patterns (Wu et al., 2010; Aitchison et al., 2011; An et al., 2014)The lower Ngamring Formation, deposited between 104 and 99 Ma, is characterized by a unimodal age pattern with a 107 Ma peak and positive εHf(t) values
The upper Ngamring and Padana Formations, deposited until 76 Ma, are characterized by a multimodal pattern with common preMesozoic ages and both positive and negative εHf(t) values.Detrital zircons from the Langjiexue Group in the Zedang-Renbu area yield ages of 400–200 Ma and positive εHf(t) values (Aikman et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010), whereas those from other parts of the Xiukang Mélange in Renbu (G.W
Detrital zircons in Middle Paleocene to Eocene syn-collisional sandstones (e.gQuxia and Jialazi Formations in the Cuojiangding, Sangdanlin and Zheya Formations in Saga, Enba and Zhaguo Formations in Tingri), sourced from the Gangdese arc and central Lhasa block, include subordinate pre-Mesozoic ages and two groups of Mesozoic ages
Quxia and Jialazi Formations in the Cuojiangding, Sangdanlin and Zheya Formations in Saga, Enba and Zhaguo Formations in Tingri), sourced from the Gangdese arc and central Lhasa block, include subordinate pre-Mesozoic ages and two groups of Mesozoic agesThe first group ranges from 201 Ma to 54 Ma with positive εHf(t) values, and the second group from 250 Ma to 92 Ma with negative εHf(t) (Wang et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2012; DeCelles et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2016, b; J
Pre-Cretaceous Tethyan Himalayan successions are characterized by the absence of detrital zircons younger than 450 Ma and by three main age groups: 570–480 Ma, clustering around 530 Ma; 1200–750 Ma, clustering around 950 Ma; and 2560–2430 Ma, clustering around 2500 Ma (DeCelles et al., 2000; Aikman et al., 2008; Gehrels et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011b)Cretaceous and Lower Paleocene sandstones of the Tethyan Himalaya yield an additional zircon age peak between 140 and 110 Ma (DeCelles et al., 2004; Hu et al., 2010; Clift et al., 2014).
Cretaceous and Lower Paleocene sandstones of the Tethyan Himalaya yield an additional zircon age peak between 140 and 110 Ma (DeCelles et al., 2004; Hu et al., 2010; Clift et al., 2014).The petrography of Group 1 quartzarenites is typical of passivemargin deposits fed from a continental block (Dickinson, 1985; Garzanti et al., 2014)
The YC1σ(2+) age of 508 Ma and the absence of zircons in the 140–110 Ma range, typical of Cretaceous/ Lower Paleocene Tethyan Himalayan units, constrain the depositional age only very loosely between the Ordovician and the Jurassic.Because of their detrital modes, detrital-zircon age pattern with a ~99 Ma peak, numerous 190–250 Ma or older ages, and Mesozoic zircons with both positive and negative εHf(t), Group 2 litho-quartzose volcaniclastic sandstones compare well with the upper Ngamring and Padana Formations in the Xigaze forearc-basin (Wu et al., 2010; An et al., 2014), and with sandstone blocks found in the Xiukang Mélange in Ngamring (Cai et al., 2012), and Renbu (G.W

The YC1σ(2+) age of ~94 Ma is quite close to that obtained for the upper Ngamring and Padana Formations of the Xigaze forearc basin, although the slightly different age peaks, more negative εHf(t) values, and numerous pre-Mesozoic detrital zircons suggest greater contribution from the central Lhasa blockIn our preferred latest Cretaceous scenario, detritus from the central Lhasa block and Gangdese magmatic arc bypassed the Xigaze forearc basin that had evolved by then to an overfilled terraced stage (An et al., 2014), and was deposited as trench-fill or trench-slope-basin turbidites.

Group 3 feldspatho-litho-quartzose volcaniclastic sandstones yield detrital zircons with dominantly Mesozoic–Paleocene and subordinate pre-Mesozoic ages, and Mesozoic–Cenozoic zircons with both positive and negative εHf(t) values, indicating provenance from the Gangdese magmatic arc and central Lhasa blockThe YC1σ(2+) age is ~54 Ma, indicating a post-Paleocene (most likely Early Eocene) depositional age
The YC1σ(2+) age is ~54 Ma, indicating a post-Paleocene (most likely Early Eocene) depositional ageThese features compare well with those of the Quxia and Jialazi Formations in Zhongba, the southern subzone of the Renbu Mélange, and the Sangdanlin and Zheya Formations in Saga, which are in the same tectonic position and interpreted to be part of the Middle Paleocene to Early Eocene syn-collisional basin (Ding et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2011; DeCelles et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014; G.W

Pre-Cretaceous turbiditic quartzarenites of Group 1 were originally deposited onto the Indian continental rise and consequently arrived at the southern Asian trench, were off-scraped, thrust and deformed as blocks within the mélange after the onset of the India/Asia collisionRadiolarian chert blocks of Middle–Late Triassic age were also deposited on the Indian continental margin (Zhu et al., 2005), and could not be incorporated into the mélange before collision with Asia
Radiolarian chert blocks of Middle–Late Triassic age were also deposited on the Indian continental margin (Zhu et al., 2005), and could not be incorporated into the mélange before collision with AsiaChert blocks of Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous age originally deposited on Neotethyan ocean floors, instead, may have reached the trench earlier and thus may have been accreted to the subduction complex or entered the subduction channel prior to collision onset.
Chert blocks of Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous age originally deposited on Neotethyan ocean floors, instead, may have reached the trench earlier and thus may have been accreted to the subduction complex or entered the subduction channel prior to collision onset.Group 2 litho-quartzose volcaniclastic turbidites were derived from the Lhasa block and were originally deposited in the trench and/or on the trench slope during the Late Cretaceous
Group 2 litho-quartzose volcaniclastic turbidites were derived from the Lhasa block and were originally deposited in the trench and/or on the trench slope during the Late CretaceousIf deposited in the trench, then Group 2 sandstones together with chert, limestone and basalt blocks may have been episodically off-scraped and accreted into the growing subduction complex before collision (Ziabrev, 2002; Shen et al., 2003a,b; Dupuis et al., 2005, 2006)
Our new field observations and provenance analysis, however, indicate that the Xiukang Mélange includes sandstone blocks containing zircons with a YC1σ(2+) age of ~54 Ma, demonstrating that its growth continued into the Early Eocene at least (Fig9)
Blocks containing Middle Permian to Upper Cretaceous limestone overlying OIB-type basalt are interpreted as Neotethyan seamounts accreted – together with chert blocks of Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous age and Group 2 Gangdese-arc-derived turbidites – to the south Asian margin during subduction (Shen et al., 2003a,b; Dai et al., 2012)During the Late Cretaceous, large volumes of detritus shed by the Lhasa block were trapped in the Xigaze forearc basin, which evolved from the initial sloped stage, to a ridged and terraced stage, and finally to a shelved and benched stage (An et al., 2014)
During the Late Cretaceous, large volumes of detritus shed by the Lhasa block were trapped in the Xigaze forearc basin, which evolved from the initial sloped stage, to a ridged and terraced stage, and finally to a shelved and benched stage (An et al., 2014)The forearc basin was thus dammed oceanward by a progressively growing subduction complex, which reached close to sea-level prior to collision onset at the end of the Cretaceous
The forearc basin was thus dammed oceanward by a progressively growing subduction complex, which reached close to sea-level prior to collision onset at the end of the CretaceousThese pieces of evidence indicate that tectonic accretion was taking place at least episodically during Late Cretaceous Neotethyan subduction.
These pieces of evidence indicate that tectonic accretion was taking place at least episodically during Late Cretaceous Neotethyan subduction.On the other hand, assemblages of oceanic rocks exposed today along the Yarlung-Zangbo suture zone are of limited width (~20 km), indicating that the Upper Cretaceous subduction complex composed of limestone, basalt, chert and occasionally volcaniclastic-sandstone blocks was significantly smaller than modern accretionary prisms undergoing rapid accretion (Schlüter et al., 2002)
On the other hand, assemblages of oceanic rocks exposed today along the Yarlung-Zangbo suture zone are of limited width (~20 km), indicating that the Upper Cretaceous subduction complex composed of limestone, basalt, chert and occasionally volcaniclastic-sandstone blocks was significantly smaller than modern accretionary prisms undergoing rapid accretion (Schlüter et al., 2002)Subduction erosion occurs along all convergent plate boundaries characterized by high convergence rates and limited sediment supply to the trench (Clift and Vannucchi, 2004; Stern, 2011)
If we consider the high subduction rate of Neotethyan lithosphere (Van der Voo et al., 1999) and the relatively small size of the Transhimalayan subduction complex, then we can conclude that the Asian margin in the studied area was with all likelihood largely erosional during much of the Cretaceous, and comparable to modern examples well documented offshore the central Andean cordillera (von Huene and Lallemand, 1990; Ranero and von Huene, 2000)We thus imagine that abyssal and trench sediments, together with seamounts lying on Neotethyan crust, were mainly dragged along the subduction channel and finally underplated at depth or digested in the mantle
Group 1 turbiditic quartzarenites were deposited in pre-Cretaceoustime on the continental rise of the Indian passive marginGroup 2
Gangdese-arc-derived turbidites were deposited during the Late Cretaceous in the trench and/or on the trench slope of the Transhimalayan active margin well before India/Asia collision onsetGroup 3 Gangdese-arc-derived sandstones were deposited not earlier than ~54 Ma, and thus after collision onset
Group 1 and Group 3 sandstones were incorporated into the Xiukang Mélange during the initial stages of the Himalayan Orogeny, whereas Group 2 sandstones may have been accreted at least in part during Neotethyan subduction in the Late Cretaceous.Contrary to what was previously believed, the Xiukang Mélange isthe product of both accretion during Cretaceous Neotethyan subduction and deformation during or after the Late Paleocene/Early Eocene early stages of the India/Asia collision
Contrary to what was previously believed, the Xiukang Mélange isthe product of both accretion during Cretaceous Neotethyan subduction and deformation during or after the Late Paleocene/Early Eocene early stages of the India/Asia collisionThe TransHimalayan margin was largely erosional during the Cretaceous and comparable to the modern active margin of central South America
The TransHimalayan margin was largely erosional during the Cretaceous and comparable to the modern active margin of central South AmericaAbyssal and trench sediments together with seamounts lying on Neotethyan crust, however, were episodically off-scraped to feed a growing subduction complex of sufficient size to trap most detritus shed by the Gangdese arc and Lhasa block in the Xigaze forearc basin.
