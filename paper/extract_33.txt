Potential sources of Cr-spinel in the Gangdese region include: 1) the Xietongmen ultramafic and mafic rock suite of debated origin, found 10 km north of the Xigaze forearc basin (Gao et al., 2003; Li et al., 2003); 2) the E/W trending and ≥60 km long Sumdo ultramafic eclogite belt of Permian age, exposed in the eastern Lhasa Block and interpreted as a dismembered ophiolite (Chen et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2009)Cr-spinels in the Quxia and Jialazi formations are unlikely to have been recycled from uplifted Cretaceous Xigaze forearc strata (Ngamring and Padana formations), because very few sandstone pebbles occur in the Quxia conglomerate, and sedimentary lithic grains (Fig

According to this interpretation, the supposedly angular unconformity between the Qubeiya and Quxia formations and the sedimentological changes within the Quxia and Jialazi formations must have resulted from changes in the dynamics of Neo-Tethyan oceanic subduction, as other unconformities documented in forearc basins worldwide (e.g., Neogene Cascadia forearc in western North America; McNeill et al., 2000; Cretaceous Yezo forearc in Japan; Ando and Tomosugi, 2005)The Qubeiya/Quxia unconformity, corresponding to a time gap potentially including much of Paleocene time (66–58 Ma), may be correlated with the angular unconformity between strongly deformed Mesozoic strata and overlying Linzizong volcanic succession in south

This is the scenario favored here, based on the following geological evidence: 1) dramatic change from shallow shelf environments (Qubeiya Formation) to debris-flow sedimentation in fan-delta settings (Quxia Formation; Liu et al., 1988; Ding et al., 2005); 2) increasing supply from Paleozoic rocks of the Lhasa continental margin as recorded by appearance of abundant zircons older than the Ordovician in the Jialazi Formation, indicating accelerated erosional unroofing of the southern Lhasa block; 3) palynofloral assemblages in the Quxia Formation (with a climax of bisaccate pollens typical of conifers living in cool mountain areas; Li et al., 2008), indicating considerable elevation of the Gangdese arc; 4) provenance similarities of the Quxia and Jialazi formations with the Sangdanlin and Zheya formations of the northern Tethys Himalaya (Wang et al., 2011; DeCelles et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014) and with the Enba and Zhaguo formations of the southern Tethys Himalaya (G.BLi et al., 2005; Hu et al., 2012; Q.H

The uncertainty remains on the origin of environmental change close to the Paleocene/Eocene boundary from proximal fan-delta deposition dominated by debris-flow conglomerates to distal fan-delta shallow-marine sedimentationThis transgression may reflect either regional tectonic causes or possibly even global eustatic control associated with latest Paleocene–early Eocene greenhouse warming (Zachos et al., 2008).
