Initial growth of the Northern Lhasaplano, Tibetan Plateau in the early Late Cretaceous (ca92 Ma)
The early Late Cretaceous topographic growth of the Northern Lhasaplano was associated with the demise of Tethyan seaways, thrustbelt development, and crustal thickeningThe same paleogeographic and paleotectonic changes were recorded earlier in the Northern Lhasaplano than in the Southern Lhasaplano, indicating progressive topographic growth from north to south across the Bangong-Nujiang suture and Lhasa block during the Cretaceous
The same paleogeographic and paleotectonic changes were recorded earlier in the Northern Lhasaplano than in the Southern Lhasaplano, indicating progressive topographic growth from north to south across the Bangong-Nujiang suture and Lhasa block during the CretaceousSimilar to the Central Andean Plateau, the Northern Lhasaplano developed by plate convergence above the oceanic Neo-Tethyan subduction zone before the onset of the India-Asia collision.
The spectacular angular unconformity separating folded Mesozoic strata of the Lhasa block (Fig1A) from the overlying, weakly deformed 60–52 Ma Linzizong volcanic succession (Pan et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2015), led to the inference of an Andean­style orogenic episode associated with the Gangdese arc (England and Searle, 1986)
Structural restorations suggest that >50 percent crustal shortening of the Lhasa block took place during the Cretaceous (Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al., 2007a; Volkmer et al., 2007), leading to the hypothesis that a “Lhasaplano,” a narrow high­elevation plateau similar in size to the modern Andean Plateau (Altiplano), developed before the India­Asia collision (Kapp et al., 2005)Wang et al
To this goal we investigated the spatial distribution, depositional age, and paleogeographic setting of non­marine Late Cretaceous strata in the Lhasa blockWe carried out detailed multi­technique sedimentological and provenance analysis based on gravel composition, sandstone petrology, paleocurrent directions, detrital zircon U­Pb ages and Hf isotopes to provide evidence for erosion of the central and northern Lhasa terranes, and resolve the timing and spatial distribution of surface uplift.

In the southern Qiangtang terrane, Cambrian metasedimentary rocks intruded by Ordovician granites lie in tectonic contact with Carboniferous–Jurassic strata (Pullen et al., 2011)Jurassic sandstones and limestones were intruded in the Jurassic (150–170 Ma) and Cretaceous (100–130 Ma) by intermediate­felsic rocks yielding εHf(t) values ranging widely from –22 to +10 (Li et al., 2014b; Liu et al., 2017)

Collectively, these data indicate that the Kcv unit was deposited in the latest Cenomanian (i.e., post 96 Ma), and was overlain by the Jingzhushan Formation deposited during the Turonian (ca92 Ma), after the Cenomanian (post­95–93 Ma) and before the late Cam panian (80 Ma).

Thirty­one zircon grains of Mesozoic age yielded εHf(t) values between –10.4 and +10.5, with TDMC model ages between 0.54 and 1.79 Ga (Table DR6; Fig8)
Twenty­six zircon grains with Mesozoic age yielded εHf(t) values between –12.6 and +9.1, with TDMC model ages between 0.58 and 1.99 Ga (Table DR6; Fig8)
During the late Cenomanian to early Turonian, widely considered as a period of global sea­level rise (Haq, 2014), shallow marine carbonate deposition (Langshan Formation) in the central­northern Lhasa terranes, was replaced by continental Jingzhushan conglomerates (Figs3 and 10)
For both formations, mainly deposited during the Turonian, provenance analysis suggests supply from the central­northern Lhasa terranes via north­directed and south­directed short and steep drainage systems (Fig10B)
The northern part of the central Lhasa terrane and the southern part of the northern Lhasa terranes thus ceased to be a basin at the close of the Early Cretaceous, when they were uplifted to become a major source of detritus.Such an early stage of plateau uplift is independently supported by pieces of geological evidence other than the sedimentary record
PostCenomanian tectonic activity is documented by northward motion along the Gaize­Siling Co thrust, which carried Langshan limestones in the hanging wall while the Jingzhushan Formation was being deposited in its footwall (Kapp et al., 2007b)At the same time, Cretaceous strata were carried southward along the Gugu La thrust while the Daxiong Formation was being deposited in its footwall (Murphy et al., 1997; Pan et al., 2004)
At the same time, Cretaceous strata were carried southward along the Gugu La thrust while the Daxiong Formation was being deposited in its footwall (Murphy et al., 1997; Pan et al., 2004)Structural restorations document more than 50 percent crustal shortening across the Lhasa block since the early Late Cretaceous (Fig
Structural restorations document more than 50 percent crustal shortening across the Lhasa block since the early Late Cretaceous (Fig9)
Tectonic and magmatic evidence are thus consistent with sedimentological and provenance analyses, indicating that a vast area, named the Northern Lhasaplano, started to grow and to be rapidly unroofed in the central­northern Lhasa terranes during the early Late Cretaceous (Fig10).
Results are compared with data from southern Qiangtang and Bangong-Nujiang suture zone (BNSZ) (Zhu et al., 2011b; Li et al., 2014b; Liu et al., 2017), igneous zircons from central-northern Lhasa (Chu et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2011a; Sun et al., 2015a), detrital zircons from the Early Cretaceous sandstone in northern Lhasa (Table DR6; see footnote 1), and igneous zircons from southern Lhasa (Chu et al., 2006; Ji et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2011b)CHUR—chondritic uniform reservoir.

The long and narrow belts of alluvial­fan conglomerates, deposited in the central­northern Lhasa terranes on the opposite sides of an area lacking Late Cretaceous–Paleogene strata ( XZBGM, 1993), confine the northern and southern margins of the tectonically uplifted Northern Lhasaplano between the Gaize­Siling Co thrust in the north and the Gugu La thrust in the south (Fig1B)
The Jingzhushan and Daxiong conglomerate belts lie today 80–150 km apart, indicating a minimum area of 80,000 km2 for the Late Cretaceous Northern Lhasaplano (Fig9)
Based on our observations, widespread deposition of Orbitolina­rich Langshan limestones on the northern Lhasa terrane continued until the latest Cenomanian to earliest Turonian (95–93 Ma), At ca92 Ma, the unconformably overlying Jingzhushan Formation containing Orbitolina­limestone clasts began to be deposited
Instead, paleoaltimetry studies based on oxygen isotopes favored northward growth of the plateau from Lhasa to Qiangtang during the Cenozoic (Rowley and Currie, 2006)Based on tectonic and paleo eleva tion evidence, Wang et al
(2008) suggested that an elevated proto­plateau existed already in the late Paleogene (ca40 Ma), and then surface uplift progressed both northward and southward
Early Cretaceous non­marine strata exposed along the BNSZ, together with provenance analysis in the northern Lhasa terrane have suggested uplift and erosion of the BNSZ in the  Aptian–Cenomanian (DeCelles et al., 2007; Leier et al., 2007a; Ma et al., 2018)At this time, most of the Lhasa block was occupied by a shallow epicontinental sea with carbonate sedimentation (Fig
Topographic growth in parts of the central Lhasa terrane began in the earliest Albian (e.g., Damxung area; Wang et al., 2017), where rapid erosional exhumation started to feed the Xigaze forearc basin at the southern edge of the southern Lhasa terrane (An et al., 2014; Orme and Laskowski, 2016).Deposition of the Jingzhushan and  Daxiong alluvial conglomerate belts, documenting retreat of the seaway and provenance of d etritus from the Northern Lhasaplano took place around 92 Ma
Fold­thrust deformation initiated along the BNSZ in the north during the Early Cretaceous, and propagated southward with time (Kapp et al., 2007b), inducing tectonic inversion of sedimentary basins and initial growth of the Northern Lhasaplano between the Gaize­Siling Co and Gugu La thrusts in the early Late CretaceousThe southern Qiangtang terrane and the BNSZ were uplifted notably earlier than the Northern Lhasaplano, thus initiating a topographic wave that swept stepwise southward across the Lhasa block during the Cretaceous.
The southern Qiangtang terrane and the BNSZ were uplifted notably earlier than the Northern Lhasaplano, thus initiating a topographic wave that swept stepwise southward across the Lhasa block during the Cretaceous.The Andean-Style Tibetan Plateau in the Late Cretaceous
The Andean-Style Tibetan Plateau in the Late CretaceousPre­collisional growth of a proto­Tibetan plateau during an Andean­style orogeny has been a long­standing proposal (England and Searle, 1986; Kapp et al., 2005, 2007a; Ding et al., 2014; Ingalls et al., 2017)
9), an inference supported by >50 percent crustal shortening during the Late Cretaceous (Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al., 2003, 2007a, 2007b; Volkmer et al., 2007, 2014) and by the large volume of detritus delivered from the central Lhasa terrane to the Xigaze forearc basin since ca88 Ma (An et al., 2014).
Despite the lack of paleoelevation estimates for the Northern Lhasaplano, an Andean­style Tibetan plateau model is favored by stable­isotope data from carbonates in the Lhasa terrane, indicating high elevation already in the Paleocene–Eocene (Ding et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015; Ingalls et al., 2017)The Andes, however, do not have a continental collision zone in its foreland, whereas the Lhasa block was affected not only by oceanic subduction in the south but also by Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous collision with Qiangtang in the north (Girardeau et al., 1984; Zhu et al., 2016; Bian et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2017)
The Andes, however, do not have a continental collision zone in its foreland, whereas the Lhasa block was affected not only by oceanic subduction in the south but also by Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous collision with Qiangtang in the north (Girardeau et al., 1984; Zhu et al., 2016; Bian et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2017)Compressional tectonic stress consequent to the Lhasa­Qiangtang collision may thus provide an alternative interpretation for the rise of the Northern Lhasaplano and for development and southward propagation of the northern Lhasa thrust belt during the Late Cretaceous
Compressional tectonic stress consequent to the Lhasa­Qiangtang collision may thus provide an alternative interpretation for the rise of the Northern Lhasaplano and for development and southward propagation of the northern Lhasa thrust belt during the Late CretaceousAlthough future studies are needed to clarify the tectonic mechanism of uplift and to constrain paleoelevation of the Northern Lhasaplano, the Late Cretaceous paleogeography of the southern Tibetan Plateau, including localized deformation and topographic relief in the Northern Lhasaplano, topographic relief in the Gangdese arc, and the intervening basin where the Daxiong Formation was deposited (Fig
Although future studies are needed to clarify the tectonic mechanism of uplift and to constrain paleoelevation of the Northern Lhasaplano, the Late Cretaceous paleogeography of the southern Tibetan Plateau, including localized deformation and topographic relief in the Northern Lhasaplano, topographic relief in the Gangdese arc, and the intervening basin where the Daxiong Formation was deposited (Fig10B), shows remarkable similarity to the early development of the Central Andean Plateau, that includes localized deformation and relief in the Eastern Cordillera, an elevated Andean magmatic arc, and the intervening Altiplano basin at low to moderate paleoelevation (e.g., Garzione et al., 2017 and references therein)
Rapid terrigenous deposition was ongoing in the early Turonian (ca92 Ma)
Paleotopography of the Northern Lhasaplano suggests that an Andean­style plateau developed above the Neo­Tethyan subduction zone in Tibet during the Late Cretaceous, preceding the continental collision between India and Asia by more than 30 m.y.Bin Wu, Zhiyong Zhu, Xiong Yan, Shijie Zhang, and Hanpu Fu are thanked for their help in the analysis of zircon U­Pb ages and Hf isotopes and Bo Zhou, Jiangang Wang, Xiaojian Liu, and Yiwei Xu for their assistance in the field
