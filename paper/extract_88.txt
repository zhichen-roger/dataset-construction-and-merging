The Lower Permian (Artinskian) Moogooloo Sandstone constitutes a prospective play in the Southern Carnarvon basin because it occurs between potential source and seal unitsDespite its favorable disposition with respect to these units, the Moogooloo Sandstone has been only sparsely explored for hydrocarbons because reservoir quality at depth has been considered a major risk.

The Moogooloo Sandstone accumulated during the early–middle Artinskian (Mory and Backhouse, 1997), after which basin subsidence continued until the latest Permian, resulting in accumulation of the upper Wooramel Group, Byro Group, and Kennedy GroupMaximum burial temperatures in the Moogooloo Sandstone/Keogh Formation interval ranged from 58°C in Ballythanna 1 to at least 120°C in areas where the overlying section was relatively thick (>2 km) (e.g., BHP Wandagee 1, Kennedy Range 1)

Subsequent uplift and erosion are assumed to have occurred mainly during continental breakup of Gondwana (Jurassic) and, by the Early Cretaceous, had resulted in erosion of variable thicknesses of section ranging from 300 m in Kennedy Range 1 to 1800 m in BHP Wandagee 1Burial depths have changed little since the Early Cretaceous, although a veneer of Cretaceous sediments, probably up to 1000 m thick, accumulated over the northern part of the Merlinleigh subbasin

Quartz overgrowth cementation in the Moogooloo Sandstone probably continued until the latest Permian, when maximum burial depths and temperatures were attained as a result of burial beneath sediments of the upper Wooramel Group, Byro Group, and Kennedy GroupThe Kennedy Range 1 area appears to be an exception, where the anomalously high maximum temperature of 210°C that was attained in the Moogooloo Sandstone probably is due to emplacement of igneous intrusions into the underlying sedimentary section in the vicinity of Kennedy Range 1 (Ghori, 1996)

The occurrence of authigenic illite in Kennedy Range 1 (2089.1 m) with a K-Ar age (Early–Middle Triassic) that is younger than the time of maximum burial is consistent with heat flow related to igneous activity; however, the illite age cannot be used to reliably constrain the timing of igneous activity due to likely contamination by coexisting detrital illiteThe age difference between the two analyzed illites (Table 1) may reflect the presence of mixed populations of detrital and authigenic illite.

Sedimentary units above and below the Moogooloo Sandstone accumulated in marine environments and there are no major unconformities within the overlying Permian units at which pre–quartz overgrowth meteoric flushing of the Moogooloo Sandstone could have occurred (based on Hocking et al., 1987)On this basis, meteoric pore waters involved in precipitation of the carbonates may have been depositional pore waters that were present in fluvial-dominated facies of the Moogooloo Sandstone

These fresh depositional pore waters would have been originally highly 18O depleted (δ18O < –14‰) given the high latitude setting (60°S) (Hocking et al., 1987) of the Southern Carnarvon basin during the Early PermianAccordingly, even if mixed with a large proportion of Early Permian seawater (δ18O = –2 to 0‰), the pore waters would have been able to retain a strong meteoric isotopic signature.

Other than these localized effects, diagenetic effects related to widespread meteoric flushing that may have occurred during the long period of uplift, nondeposition, and erosion that followed the Permian subsidence phase cannot be recognized.Although only minor petroleum shows have been recorded in the Moogooloo Sandstone, results of a fluid inclusion study of the Moogooloo Sandstone in several wells (Eadington, 1997) provide evidence for oil migration having occurred in the unit

Oil migration was at least partly coincident with quartz overgrowth cementation, implying that oil was migrating prior to the latest PermianOn the basis of fluorescence color, the migrating oil was considered by Eadington (1997) to have been expelled from source rocks at the onset of oil generation, except in Giralia 1, where oil appears to have been expelled at peak oil generation.

Most diagenetic effects occurred during a single Early–Late Permian subsidence episode that was followed by a long period of uplift, nondeposition, and erosion.Reservoir quality decreases with increasing thermal maturity, reflecting the temperature control on quartz overgrowth cementation
