A detailed study using back-scattered electron imaging and electron-microprobe analysis shows that grains of detrital monazite are present in the Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic and Jurassic sediments of the Tim Mersoï basin, NigerDespite variations in the size and shape of monazite grains, the U–Th–Pb chemical ages obtained by electron microprobe fall in a narrow range, 425 to 650 Ma

Considering the composition and ages of monazite, Pan-African granites and metamorphic rocks rather than the anorogenic Devonian volcanic rocks are assumed to be the main source for the monazite in the Tim Mersoï basinAccording to the paleodirections obtained by Valsardieu (1971), these detrital products could be issued from the Aïr Mountains during the Carboniferous and from the Zinder and Nigeria basements during the Permian – Triassic – Jurassic
