Lower Cretaceous strata in the Baingoin basin of the northern Lhasa terrane record initial collision between the Lhasa and Qiangtang blocks, followed by the early uplift of central TibetNorth-south traverses across the Baingoin basin highlight major differences between the Duba Formation in the north and the quasi-coeval Duoni Formation in the south
Abundance of detrital zircons yielding Jurassic-Cretaceous ages with εHf(t) values mainly between −2 and +10, occurrence of chert, Cr-spinel, and pyroxene grains, together with southward paleocurrent directions indicate that the Duba Formation was sourced from the southern Qiangtang terrane and Bangong-Nujiang suture zone to the northThe Duoni Formation in the south was deposited in shelfal to fan-delta and fluvial environments
Abundant volcanic clasts, detrital zircons yielding Cretaceous ages with mainly negative εHf(t) values, and northward paleocurrents indicate an active volcanic source located in the central Lhasa terrane to the south, with minor input from the northern Lhasa terraneOnly the northern part of the Baingoin basin was directly controlled by the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision and may thus be considered a peripheral foreland basin, whereas the southern part was mainly influenced by tectonic processes related to the northward subduction of Neotethyan lithosphere, and may thus be comparable to a retroarc foreland basin
The Lhasa block, the last microcontinent accreted to Asia before final collision with India in the Paleocene, is delimited by the Indus-Yarlung suture in the south and the Bangong-Nujiang suture in the north (Allègre et al., 1984; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Fig1a)
During the Cretaceous, the Lhasa block was influenced by both ongoing Lhasa-Qiangtang collision in the north and northward subduction of Neotethyan lithosphere in the south (England and Searle, 1986; Pan et al., 2006; Kapp et al., 2007; Leier et al., 2007b; Zhu et al., 2016)This complex paleotectonic scenario would imply the development of a peripheral foreland basin in the northern part of the Lhasa block
When was the Bangong-Nujiang suture zone closed, uplifted, and exhumed? During the Early Cretaceous (Kapp et al., 2005), before the Early Eocene (Wang et al., 2008), or after the India-Asia collision onset (Rowley and Currie, 2006)? Is there any direct sedimentary evidence in the Lhasa block that may help constraining the controversial timing of initial Lhasa-Qiangtang collision, ranging widely from as early as Middle Jurassic to as late as Late Cretaceous (Pan et al., 1983; Leier et al., 2007b; Baxter et al., 2009; Fan et al., 2014; Yan et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016; Bian et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017b; Ma et al., 2017)?The aim of this article is to investigate the Early Cretaceous sedimentary record of the northern Lhasa terrane in order to provide an answer to these questions and clarify the paleogeographic and paleogeodynamic evolution of the Lhasa block and Lhasa-Qiangtang
The aim of this article is to investigate the Early Cretaceous sedimentary record of the northern Lhasa terrane in order to provide an answer to these questions and clarify the paleogeographic and paleogeodynamic evolution of the Lhasa block and Lhasa-Qiangtang1342-937X/© 2019 International Association for Gondwana Research
Early Cretaceous strata are widely exposed in the northern Lhasa terrane, thus providing crucial information to constrain the age of the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision onset and of initial uplift of the central Tibetan Plateau.In this study we have measured six stratigraphic sections along a north-south traverse across the Baingoin basin in the northern Lhasa terrane
New data were collected from Lower Cretaceous strata on sedimentary facies, sandstone petrology, paleocurrent directions, detrital Cr-spinel chemistry, detrital zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotopes in order to determine provenance of detritus, evolution of the Baingoin basin, and timing of the initial collision between the Lhasa and Qiangtang blocks.The Lhasa block (Fig
The southern Lhasa terrane includes the Upper Triassic to Cenozoic Gangdese granitoid arc batholith, the mostly Paleogene Linzizong volcanic succession (Chu et al., 2006; Ji et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2011b; Dong et al., 2014), and the Cretaceous Xigaze forearc basin (Dürr, 1996; Ding and Lai, 2003; Wang et al., 2012; An et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2017a)The central Lhasa terrane includes a Precambrian crystalline basement (Dewey and Burke, 1973; Allègre et al., 1984), very-low-grade Carboniferous metasediments, Permian limestones, and Jurassic siliciclastic rocks (Leeder et al., 1988; Yin et al., 1988)

Younger rocks include the widespread Cretaceous Zenong volcanics (Zhu et al., 2009a), the Late Cretaceous non-marine Daxiong Formation, and Cenozoic continental strata (XZBGM, 1993; GSun et al., 2015)
The northern Lhasa terrane includes thick Late Jurassic metasediments (XZBGM, 1993), Early Cretaceous marginal-marine and deltatic clastics (Zhang et al., 2004; Leier et al., 2007a; Leier et al., 2007b; Volkmer et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2011), Aptian-Cenomanian limestones of the Langshan Formation (Leier et al., 2007b; Scott et al., 2010; Rao et al., 2015; BouDagher-Fadel et al., 2017), and Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic continental sandstone and conglomerate (DeCelles et al., 2007; Kapp et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2011)Mid- to Late Cretaceous plutonic rocks and volcanic rocks of the Qushenla Formation also occur (Zhu et al., 2011b; G.Y
Mid- to Late Cretaceous plutonic rocks and volcanic rocks of the Qushenla Formation also occur (Zhu et al., 2011b; G.YSun et al., 2015).
The Bangong-Nujiang suture zone (BNSZ), separating the Lhasa and Qiangtang blocks, includes Jurassic deep-sea turbidites (Girardeau et al., 1984; Dewey et al., 1988; Li et al., 2017a), olistostrome (YZeng et al., 2016; M
An angular unconformity separates ophiolites and the mélange from the overlying Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous shallow-marine clastic rocks (Li et al., 2017a)Mid-Cretaceous OIB-type basalts were interpreted as seamounts (Zhu et al., 2006; Fan et al., 2014) or intraplate volcanism
Mid-Cretaceous OIB-type basalts were interpreted as seamounts (Zhu et al., 2006; Fan et al., 2014) or intraplate volcanismLate Cretaceous to Cenozoic fluvial or lacustrine sequences with interbedded volcanic rocks characterize the northern Nima and Lunpola basins (XZBGM, 1993; Kapp et al., 2005; DeCelles et al., 2007; Kapp et al., 2007).
Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic fluvial or lacustrine sequences with interbedded volcanic rocks characterize the northern Nima and Lunpola basins (XZBGM, 1993; Kapp et al., 2005; DeCelles et al., 2007; Kapp et al., 2007).To the north of the BNSZ, the Qiangtang block is divided into northern and southern terranes either by the Longmu–Shuanghu suture zone (Li, 1987; Li et al., 1995; Wang et al., 2015) or by a blueschist-bearing, Triassic metamorphic mélange belt (Cheng and Xu, 1987; Kapp et al., 2000; Kapp et al., 2003b; Pullen et al., 2008; Zhang and Tang, 2009)
To the north of the BNSZ, the Qiangtang block is divided into northern and southern terranes either by the Longmu–Shuanghu suture zone (Li, 1987; Li et al., 1995; Wang et al., 2015) or by a blueschist-bearing, Triassic metamorphic mélange belt (Cheng and Xu, 1987; Kapp et al., 2000; Kapp et al., 2003b; Pullen et al., 2008; Zhang and Tang, 2009)In the southern Qiangtang terrane, Cambrian metasedimentary rocks intruded by Ordovician granites lie in tectonic contact with Carboniferous–Jurassic strata (Pullen et al., 2011)
In the southern Qiangtang terrane, Cambrian metasedimentary rocks intruded by Ordovician granites lie in tectonic contact with Carboniferous–Jurassic strata (Pullen et al., 2011)Widespread marine Jurassic sandstone and limestone (Kapp et al., 2003b; Zhang et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2017) were intruded by arc-related intermediate to felsic rocks in the Jurassic (150–170 Ma) and Cretaceous
Widespread marine Jurassic sandstone and limestone (Kapp et al., 2003b; Zhang et al., 2012; Ma et al., 2017) were intruded by arc-related intermediate to felsic rocks in the Jurassic (150–170 Ma) and Cretaceous(100–130 Ma) (J.X
Minor Cretaceous strata and Cenozoic non- marine deposits also occur (XZBGM, 1993; Kapp et al., 2005)Paleozoic strata and Triassic limestone are widely exposed in the central and northern Qiangtang block (Li et al., 1995; Kapp et al., 2000).
Paleozoic strata and Triassic limestone are widely exposed in the central and northern Qiangtang block (Li et al., 1995; Kapp et al., 2000).The Baingoin basin, located between the Nam Co and the BNSZ, is divided in two parts by a ~60 km-long and up to 10 km-wide east-west belt of biotite-bearing granites of Cretaceous age (139–79 Ma; Volkmer et al., 2014; Fig
The Baingoin basin, located between the Nam Co and the BNSZ, is divided in two parts by a ~60 km-long and up to 10 km-wide east-west belt of biotite-bearing granites of Cretaceous age (139–79 Ma; Volkmer et al., 2014; Fig1c)
These igneous rocks experienced rapid to moderate cooling and exhumation by the latest Cretaceous-early Paleogene based on low-temperature thermochronology (70–55 Ma; Hetzel et al., 2011)The basin is characterized by widely exposed Lower Cretaceous marginal-marine and deltatic clastic sediments interbedded with volcanic tuffs (Zhang et al., 2004; Leier et al., 2007a; Leier et al., 2007b; Volkmer et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2011)
The basin is characterized by widely exposed Lower Cretaceous marginal-marine and deltatic clastic sediments interbedded with volcanic tuffs (Zhang et al., 2004; Leier et al., 2007a; Leier et al., 2007b; Volkmer et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2011)Because of significant stratigraphic differences between the northern and southern parts of the basin, they were defined as Duba Formation in the north (Leeder et al., 1988; Leier et al., 2007b) and Duoni Formation in the Nam Co area to the south (XZBGM, 1993; Zhang et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2017)
Lower Cretaceous strata are in fault contact with continental deposits of the Upper Cretaceous Jingzhushan Formation (Fig4a).
During the Early Cretaceous, the Baingoin basin was bounded by the north-dipping and south-vergent Shiquanhe-Gaize-Amdo thrust in the north (SGAT in Fig1b), and by the south-dipping and north-vergent Geren Co-Jiali thrust in the south (GJT in Fig
Shiquanhe-Gaize-Amdo thrust activity caused deformation and uplift above sea level of Jurassic marine rocks and Lower Cretaceous granites within the BNSZ (Yin and Harrison, 2000; Kapp et al., 2005; Kapp et al., 2007)The NW–SE-trending Geren Co-Jiali thrust, extending from Geren Co in the west to the Nam Co and Jiali areas in the east, placed Carboniferous strata and Early Cretaceous Zenong volcanic rocks in its hanging wall onto Early Cretaceous strata of the Baingoin and Selin Co basins in its footwall around 130 Ma (Ding and Lai, 2003).
The NW–SE-trending Geren Co-Jiali thrust, extending from Geren Co in the west to the Nam Co and Jiali areas in the east, placed Carboniferous strata and Early Cretaceous Zenong volcanic rocks in its hanging wall onto Early Cretaceous strata of the Baingoin and Selin Co basins in its footwall around 130 Ma (Ding and Lai, 2003).Detailed stratigraphic sections were measured at 6 localities (sites shown in Fig
Thirty-three Mesozoic zircons yielded εHf(t) values between −12.7 and +12.2, with TCDM model ages between 0.47 and 1.98 GaOlder U-Pb ages cluster at 250–350, 450–700, 750–900, 1000–1350, 1600–1900 Ma, and 2400–2700 Ma.
Ninety-four Mesozoic zircons yielded εHf (t) values between −19.9 and +13.5, with TCDM model ages between 0.41 and 2.48 GaOlder U-Pb ages cluster at 250–350, 450–500, 550–650, 700–900, 1100–1350, 1550–1650, and 1700–2000 Ma
Sample 15MD01 and 15MD13 (section DB03) yielded 145 concordant U-Pb zircon ages, 86 of which between 120 and 170 Ma (peak at ~130 Ma), Forty-six Mesozoic zircons yielded εHf(t) values between −5.0 and +6.9, with TCDM model ages between 0.75 and 1.52 GaOlder U-Pb ages cluster at 250–350, 450–600, 700–900, 950–1250, and 1800–1950 Ma, and 2300–2500 Ma.
Our results indicate that deposition of the Duba Formation began by 122 Ma and continued to ~110 Ma (Aptian–early Albian), which is broadly compatible but somewhat younger than the maximum depositional age of 125 ± 2 Ma obtained from detrital zircons by Leier et al(2007b), and ages of 138 ± 2 and 119 ± 5 Ma obtained for volcanic tuffs by Volkmer et al
Mesozoic detrital zircons never yielded εHf(t) values N 10, indicating that provenance was not from the Gangdese arc characterized by high positive εHf(t) (Fig9; Chu et al., 2006; Ji et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2011b)
The Early Cretaceous detrital zircons yielding εHf(t) values between −12 and +8 can be traced within the Baingoin Batholith itself (Zhu et al., 2016)The most likely source for these detrital zircons is the northern Lhasa terrane (Zhu et al., 2011b; Hou et al., 2015).
Because detritus from the Lhasa block have reached the mélange in trench of BNSZ since early Jurassic (Lai et al., 2017), these pre-Mesozoic detrital zircons, which have similar age spectra as those in the central Lhasa terrane, might be also recycled from the BNSZ.Combined petrographic, geochemical and geochronological evidence suggests that the Duba Formation was fed partly from the BNSZ and southern Qiangtang terrane in the north, where suprasubduction-zone ophiolites, a Jurassic magmatic arc, and preCretaceous strata were exposed to erosion, and partly from Lower Cretaceous magmatic rocks of the northern Lhasa terrane itself.

Ninety-two Mesozoic zircons yieldedεHf(t) values between −11.4 and +10.6, with TCDM model ages between 0.54 and 1.91 Ga
Most zircons yielded Early Cretaceous ages and negative εHf(t) values, which matches very well the age populations ranging between 143 and 107 Ma with negative εHf(t) values characterizing Zenong volcanic rocks of the central Lhasa terrane (Chu et al., 2006; Zhu et al., 2009a; Zhu et al., 2011b)Furthermore, detrital zircons in the 950–1200 Ma age range characterize Upper Paleozoic strata of the central Lhasa terrane (Leier et al., 2007b; Leier et al., 2007c; Gehrels et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011a; G
Furthermore, detrital zircons in the 950–1200 Ma age range characterize Upper Paleozoic strata of the central Lhasa terrane (Leier et al., 2007b; Leier et al., 2007c; Gehrels et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011a; GLi et al., 2014)
Detrital zircons in the Duoni Formation compare poorly also with zircons with extremely positive εHf (t) values in the Gangdese magmatic arc and Xigaze forearc basin of the southern Lhasa terrane (Chu et al., 2006; Ji et al., 2009; Wu et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2011b; An et al., 2014), whereas some Cretaceous zircons with mildly positive (b8.0) εHf(t) values resemble those of magmatic zircons from the northern Lhasa terrane (Zhu et al., 2011b; Hou et al., 2015)Lower Cretaceous Zenong volcanics and Upper Paleozoic strata of the central Lhasa terrane were thus the predominant source of detritus for the Duoni Formation, possibly with minor contributions from the northern Lhasa terrane.
Lower Cretaceous Zenong volcanics and Upper Paleozoic strata of the central Lhasa terrane were thus the predominant source of detritus for the Duoni Formation, possibly with minor contributions from the northern Lhasa terrane.Despite their broad similarities in clastic lithology, depositional environments, and age, the Duba and Duoni formations differ markedly in the following aspects:
During the latest Early Cretaceous (Aptian-Albian), the articulated paleogeography of the Lhasa block included a residual seaway in the north, separated by central Lhasa highlands from a shallow seaway in the middle, separated in turn by the Gangdese arc from the Neotethys ocean to the south (Fig11).
sea in the southern Qiangtang basin should have retreated before the Aptian (Ma et al., 2018), because by 118 Ma continental redbeds sourced from Qiangtang highlands were deposited in the northern Nima basin ~300 km west of our studied area (DeCelles et al., 2007; Kapp et al., 2007).In the Aptian to early Albian, the Duoni and Duba formations are exposed in the southern and northern region Baingoin Basin (Fig
In the Aptian to early Albian, the Duoni and Duba formations are exposed in the southern and northern region Baingoin Basin (Fig1c), respectively
These zircon ages demonstrate that Early Cretaceous clastic rocks began accumulating before ~122 Ma; continued to accumulate until ~110–109 MaThe large benthic foraminifera and rudist of the Langshan limestone yielded an Aptian-Cenomanian age (Leier et al., 2007b; Scott et al., 2010; Rao et al., 2015; BouDagher-Fadel et al., 2017), thus, implying that these three formations were diachronous phenomenons in the Baingoin Basin during the Aptian to early Albian
The large benthic foraminifera and rudist of the Langshan limestone yielded an Aptian-Cenomanian age (Leier et al., 2007b; Scott et al., 2010; Rao et al., 2015; BouDagher-Fadel et al., 2017), thus, implying that these three formations were diachronous phenomenons in the Baingoin Basin during the Aptian to early AlbianSun et al
(2017) also found the Early Cretaceous diachronous phenomenons of clastic rocks and limestones in the Coqen Basin on the west of northern Lhasa terraneSimilar to the Selin Co basin located to the west (Zhang et al., 2011), the Baingoin basin was a progressively shrinking shallow seaway bounded by two shorelines in the southeast and northwest, defined by the prograding delta and fan-delta of the Duba and Duoni formations, fed from opposite sides (Fig
Due to the global sea-level rising (Sun et al., 2017) or subsidence (Leier et al., 2007b) during Albian to Cenmanian, the Duba and Duoni formations were replaced by the Langshan marine carbonate environments on the northern Lhasa terrane.Provenance of the Duoni Formation from the central Lhasa terrane implies that central Lhasa was being uplifted as well, which is supported by the lack of Early Cretaceous strata (Pan et al., 2004) and by deposition around 111 Ma of the alluvial-fan Damxung Conglomerate southeast of Nam Co (Wang et al., 2017b) (Fig

Farther south in the Linzhou basin, b200-m-thick Orbitolinid-bearing limestones (Penbo Member of the Takena Formation) with terrestrial debris were being deposited in a shallow seaway separating the uplifted central Lhasa terrane from the Gandese arc, and replaced by northwardprograding fluvio-deltaic deposits not earlier than the late Albian (Leier et al., 2007a)The simultaneous limestones were also deposited in the west of the central Lhasa terrane (G
During the Aptian-Albian, instead, radiolarian cherts and deep-sea turbidites were being deposited in the underfilled Xigaze forearc basin floored by the Yarlung-Zangbo ophiolites (An et al., 2014; Orme and Laskowski, 2016; Wang et al., 2017a), implying that the southernmost Lhasa terrane lay at abyssal depths at the northern edge of the vast Neotethyan oceanic realm (Fig11).
Tectonic setting of Early Cretaceous sedimentary basins in northern LhasaThe early tectonic evolution of the Lhasa block during the Cretaceous, the origin of sedimentary basins, and the subduction polarity of Bangong oceanic lithosphere remain controversial (Leeder et al., 1988; Murphy et al., 1997; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Kapp et al., 2003a; Kapp
The early tectonic evolution of the Lhasa block during the Cretaceous, the origin of sedimentary basins, and the subduction polarity of Bangong oceanic lithosphere remain controversial (Leeder et al., 1988; Murphy et al., 1997; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Kapp et al., 2003a; Kappet al., 2005; DeCelles et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2009a; Zhu et al., 2016)
It has been proposed that, following closure of the Bangong Ocean in the north, a broad Cretaceous peripheral foreland basin formed in the northern part of the Lhasa block under the weight of the overthrusting Qiangtang terrane and Shiquanhe-Gaize-Amdo thrust system (Leeder et al., 1988; Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al., 2003a; Kapp et al., 2005; DeCelles et al., 2007)Considering instead the Gangdese arc in the south, the northern Lhasa terrane was proposed to have hosted a back-arc extensional (Zhang et al., 2004) or retroarc foreland basin (Zhang et al., 2011)
The geochemistry of widespread Cretaceous magmatic rocks in the northern Lhasa terrane suggest an orogenic rather than extensional setting (Zhu et al., 2009a; Zhu et al., 2011b; Chen et al., 2014; Hao et al., 2016), as independently indicated by major compressional tectonic structures bordering the Baingoin basin, including the Geren Co-Jiali thrust, Baingoin thrust, and the Shiquanhe-GaizeAmdo thrust (Yin and Harrison, 2000; Ding and Lai, 2003; Kapp et al., 2007; Volkmer et al., 2014).Our new stratigraphic observations indicate that the origin of the Baingoin basin is more complex than previously thought
Though the northern side of the basin may be considered a peripheral foreland basin, whereas the southern part is more comparable to a retroarc foreland basin, the peculiar features of the Aptian-Albian Baingoin basin thus do not fit well with any textbook modelThis special basin architecture was plausibly controlled by the Lhasa-Qiangtang collision in the northern part but mainly influenced by tectonic processes related to the northward subduction of Neotethyan lithosphere in the
This result is comparable with the 140–130 Ma collision based on magmatic gap in southern Qiangtang block (Zhu et al., 2016), Early Cretaceous (N130 Ma) collision determined by the paleolatitude (Bian et al., 2017 and reference therein), 166 Ma collision based on the uncomformity in southern Qiangtang basin (Ma et al., 2017), and the angular unconformities between the ophiolites and overlying Dongqiao Formation conglomerate at 143–131 Ma in BNSZ (Girardeau et al., 1984; Sun, 2005).The Duba and Duoni formations were deposited, in the northern and southern parts of the Baingoin basin respectively, during the Aptian and early Albian
The Duba and Duoni formations were deposited, in the northern and southern parts of the Baingoin basin respectively, during the Aptian and early AlbianThey similarly document progradation of fluvio-deltaic systems onto a shallow shelf, and were both overlain by rudist- and Orbitolina-bearing limestones of the Langshan Formation in the midAlbian
They similarly document progradation of fluvio-deltaic systems onto a shallow shelf, and were both overlain by rudist- and Orbitolina-bearing limestones of the Langshan Formation in the midAlbianTheir provenance and tectonic significance are however radically different
