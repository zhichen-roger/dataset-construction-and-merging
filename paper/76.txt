This particular samples is a suite of zircon from a single sandstone sample of the Eocene Ukelayet Flysch, Northern Kamchatka, RussiaSeveral end members are worth noting (see text for discussion): Very well-rounded grains are likely to be polycyclic; Colorless with little damage and/or low REE; Colorless and euhedral; Grains of the red series; Grains of the yellow series.
(2001) in a study of the upper Oligocene Macigno Formation in the northern Apennines, ItalyMost sedimentary rocks that occur today in the Apennines were originally derived from the European Alps (e.g
Through combination of these two particular provenance techniques these authors were able to propose a detailed picture of sediment source and transport pathways into the foreland basin during the Oligocene and MioceneThis study highlights the important trend towards using multiple provenance techniques to develop a more robust provenance picture.
(2004) studied 24 Cretaceous to Tertiary samples from strata in the Andean Amazon basin in EcuadorThey recognize several important changes in ZFT grain-age distributions in the stratigraphic sequence
In the lower part of the Cretaceous section they discovered that part of the population consists of relatively old DZFT ages (Paleozoic), in zircons that are characteristically dark and roundedThese zircons occur in sedimentary rocks that have a high ZTR index
Because the ZTR index is high for these samples, they attributed the zircons as polycyclic and derived from the Paleozoic platform cover to the cratonUp-section, they
The DZFT cooling ages in this part of the section are therefore inferred to record Middle to Late Eocene exhumation of a high-grade metamorphic terrane that may have been affected by collision of the Macuchi Arc terrane to the eastern edge of EcuadorIn the Early Miocene, short lag times are attributed to signifi cant volcanic activity in the source region because the heavy mineral assemblage contains euhedral biotite, hornblende, diopside, apatite and idiomorphic zircon
In the Early Miocene, short lag times are attributed to signifi cant volcanic activity in the source region because the heavy mineral assemblage contains euhedral biotite, hornblende, diopside, apatite and idiomorphic zirconIn addition, the ZFT and apatite FT ages are identical, and therefore it is likely that both refl ect cooling of volcanic rocks (Ruiz et al
These researchers carried out detailed analyses of Cretaceous to Eocene turbiditic sandstone along most of the Kamchatka margin and in the southern Koryak upland farther northThey determined that the youngest age component of each of their samples was comprised mainly of euhedral and colorless zircon inferred to be fi rst-cycle volcanic zircons
Stewart and Brandon (2004) conducted a detailed examination of the siliciclastic, lower Miocene “Hoh Formation” of the Coastal OSCThey analyzed 34 sandstone samples and 2 volcanic ash layers of the coastal OSC, and used the young peak age to show that most of the strata are Lower Miocene
They analyzed 34 sandstone samples and 2 volcanic ash layers of the coastal OSC, and used the young peak age to show that most of the strata are Lower MioceneThey note that most sandstones in the Hoh Formation are variable in composition, but most fall between lithic arkoses or lithic wackes, with volcanic lithic fragments
The authors analyzed samples from the modern Indus River, as well as from stratigraphic sections of the Miocene to Pliocene Siwalik Formations in PakistanThey concluded that exhumation rates of 300 m/m.y
The results of this re-analysis indicate that lag time becomes shorter up-section for both P1 and P2 age components (moving peaks) in the Indus River and Siwalik sediments from the Middle Miocene to the Recent (Fig13)
This up-section change suggests that this part of the Himalayas has been in a constructional phase with increasing relief and accelerating exhumation rates since the Miocene.British Columbia Coast Range, Canada
Eight stratigraphically coordinated samples ranging in age from Middle Eocene to Miocene (40 to 19 Ma) were analyzed using this approachKnown ZFT cooling ages in the modern Coast Plutonic Complex (CPC), the incidental source of the sediment, were also considered in the analysis
Both P1 and P2 data indicate that the fastest exhuming areas of the Himalayas in NW Pakistan are in a constructional phase since at least the MioceneShortening of lag time up-section implies an increase in exhumation rates (data from Cerveny et al
The second aspect is that the fi rst detritus shed off the uplifted and exhuming CPC included old basin deposits (Cretaceous), which resulted in a complicated distribution of grain ages, and a lithic feldspathic sandstone compositionThe important point of these two examples is that the sediment provenance of this basin sequence plays a crucial role in interpreting the signifi cance of the DZFT ages.
The Alps are an excellent mountain belt for exhumation studies because they have evolved without signifi cant volcanism since the OligoceneBecause the orogen lacks signifi cant igneous heating, samples collected from controlled stratigraphic sections of synorogenic sediment of foreland and hinterland basins provide insight into the long-term exhumation history
Analysis of the youngest peak age in each sample shows that exhumation rates of the fastest exhuming areas in the Alps have remained relatively constant since the Early Miocene at long-term average rates of about 700 m/m.yContinuous P2 lag times give exhumation rates of 300–400 m/m.y
Note that most samples show relatively constant P1 and P2 trends (moving peaks) since the early MioceneThe main source areas are indicated as Penninic core, Austroalpine, and Cretaceous to Jurassic cover units in the Alps.

Clark and Jäger 1969; Hinderer 2001), the exhumational steadystate interpretation is in apparent confl ict with a dramatic increase in sediment yield from the Alps since the Pliocene as predicted from sediment budget calculations (Kuhlemann 2000) or apatite FT analysis in drill cores from the North Alpine Foreland basin (Cederbom et al2004)
FT analysis of detrital zircon from Cenozoic sandstone in the exhumed core of the Olympic Subduction Complex (OSC) and in fl anking units, defi ne the timing of deposition, subduction accretion, and exhumation in the core of the Olympic Mountains (Brandon and Vance 1992)Detrital zircons have reset FT ages of ~14 Ma in the core of the OSC, and this cooling age is related to post-metamorphic cooling driven by erosional exhumation
Detrital zircon from metamorphosed Eocene to Miocene sedimentary rocks of the Taiwanese Alps record the progressive north-to-south exhumation that has brought meta-sediments in the axial spine of the range to the surface as a consequence of the ongoing oblique collision between the Luzon arc and the Asian mainland (Liu et al2001; Willett et al
The Cordillera Huayhuash and surrounding areas of the Puna surface of this part of the high Andes are underlain by Cretaceous quartzites that have been subjected to moderate temperatures for long intervals of time and therefore they record the effects of reheating and prolonged cooling of high-damaged zircon (Garver et al2005)
Bedrock is dominated by folded Mesozoic miogeoclinal rocks unconformably overlain by mid-Tertiary volcanics intruded by late Tertiary granitic rocks and silicic dikesIn areas where the rocks are completely unreset, quartzites have late Paleozoic cooling ages and therefore by the time they were heated in the Tertiary, zircons had at least 200 to 300 m.y
In areas where the rocks are completely unreset, quartzites have late Paleozoic cooling ages and therefore by the time they were heated in the Tertiary, zircons had at least 200 to 300 m.yof accumulated radiation damage, much more, on average, than the two examples highlighted above.
These Lower Cretaceous quartzites have ZFT ages with a wide range of cooling ages, but almost all are younger than depositional age of the host strata, so resetting has been pervasive (Fig15)
Lower Paleozoic strata of the lower Hudson Valley in New York State were deposited and shallowly buried (c5 km) prior to rifting of the North Atlantic and associated rift-basin formation in eastern North America
Detrital zircons from the Ordovician Austin Glen Formation and the Silurian Shawangunk Conglomerates have a wide spectrum of cooling ages, most of which are younger than depositional ages, so resetting is widespread (Garver et al2002)
Cooling ages can be divided into three populations: a) reset in the Early Jurassic (~185 Ma); b) reset or partially reset in the late Paleozoic (c275–322); and; c) unreset to partially reset in the early Paleozoic (Fig
275–322); and; c) unreset to partially reset in the early Paleozoic (Fig16)
experienced an Early Jurassic thermal event, and it would appear that only the most damaged grains were resetRocks in this part of the Hudson Valley experienced temperatures of ~180–220 °C, based on published vitrinite refl ectance, CAI, and illite crystallinity values
These data suggest that the zircons were reset during Early Jurassic heating and an elevated geothermal gradient of ~50 °C/km (see Garver et al., 2002).Figure 15
Probability density plots of unreset, partly reset, and fully reset zircons from Cretaceous quartzites in the Cordillera Huayhuash, Perú (from Garver et alin press)
Depositional age is Lower Cretaceous (100–120 Ma).Figure 16
These Paleozoic sandstones are inferred to have been heated to temperatures in the range of 180–200 °C during the thermal affects associated with opening of the North Atlantic (Garver and Bartholomew 2001).Depositional age of these units is Silurian and Ordovician, so any grain with a possible provenance age (and hence unreset) falls in the diagonally ruled fi eldSubsequent heating (gray shaded zone) apparently fully reset a number of grains that collectively defi ne cooling at c
Heating occurred in the early Mesozoic (MZ) and was associated with the opening of the North Atlantic.Shimanto Belt, SW Japan
They showed that the structurally highest rocks of the Malaguide Complex cooled relatively slowly during the latest Oligocene (Aquitanian), while deep-seated metamorphic units of the Alpujarride complex experienced rapid cooling of up to 300ºC/m.ybetween the Burdigalian to Langhian (c

The approach to solving this problem in the Khorat Basin was to fi rst analyze two aliquots of zircon from the Mesozoic Phra Wihan Formation, one with the fi ssion-track method and one with the U/Pb method (Carter and Moss 1999)Grains dated with the FT method were removed from their Tefl on mounts and dated with the U/Pb method using an ion probe (SHRIMP)
For example ZHe dating and U/Pb dating done on the same single zircon grains from the Jurassic Navajo sandstone in the southwestern United States allowed a robust interpretation of the source region (Rahl et al2003)
