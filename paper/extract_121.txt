ABSTRACT: Intrusion of a dolerite sill into clay-bearing, arkosic Triassic Sherwood Group sandstones with moderate porosity (22 percent) and high but anisotropic permeability (mode 500 md) led to the progressive transformation of precursor diagenetic mineralsIn the host rock, locally pore-filling Mg-rich smectite (saponite), quartz, and dolomite, existing in the rock following earlier burial diagenesis, reacted to produce grain-coating flakes of talc at the lowest contact temperatures (130– 1808C; based on equilibrium reaction-path and thermal-history calculations)

In many sedimentary basins, igneous intrusions are common (e.g., Manspeizer 1988, Triassic synrift igneous and volcanics; Darros de Matos 1992, Cretaceous fluvial redbeds with intrusives)The effects of intrusions on host sedimentary rocks fall outside the realm of normal burial diagenetic processes, although the maximum temperatures attained in the host rock may not be much greater than the temperatures of advanced burial diagenesis

1) the SSG is locally underlain by Lower Permian sediments and capped by the Upper Triassic Mercia Mudstone GroupIt crops out locally but is presently most deeply buried in a basin centered on Lough Neagh (where it is up to 800 m thick) and underlies the Antrim coast (Parnell 1991)

A maximum burial depth of about 2000 m was achieved for the SSG in later Mesozoic times (Shelton 1997)Maximum paleotemperatures may have reached 75–858C assuming a geothermal gradient of about 308C/ km (typical of many rift-related sedimentary basins in the late thermal subsidence stage; North 1985) and a surface temperature of about 18–308C (reasonable for subaerial temperatures in the early Tertiary; Frakes et al

Dolomite is present in minor quantities and is thought to typify early diagenesis (pedogenesis) in Triassic sandstones across northwest Europe (Burley 1984; Strong and Milodowski 1987; Worden et al1999), and there is no evidence to suggest otherwise for the SSG at Scrabo

The heating event in the country rock can be measured in terms of tens to thousands of days compared to tens to hundreds of million years for the burial diagenesis of this Triassic sandstone.The rock samples at about 3 m distance from the intrusion achieved a maximum temperature of about 2308C at a time of 20 to 30 days after the intrusion occurred

Present-day Triassic sandstone formation waters in Northern Ireland are highly saline (200 g/l) with cations dominated by Na (Bennett 1983)The Triassic sandstones in this area are associated with bedded halite, and it is reasonable to assume that pre-intrusion pore waters were highly enriched in aqueous sodium

The Triassic sandstones in this area are associated with bedded halite, and it is reasonable to assume that pre-intrusion pore waters were highly enriched in aqueous sodiumNote that the few other reports of high-temperature diagenetic talc involve silicate diagenesis in the presence of halite-rich evaporites (Bailey 1949; Evans 1970; Schreyer and Abraham 1976; Scrivener and Sanderson 1982), reaffirming the importance of saline formation waters at the time of contact diagenesis at Scrabo Quarry
