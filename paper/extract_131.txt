Abstract – The Aptian stratigraphic record of the Alicante region consists of: a rudist and coral-rich carbonate platform of earliest Aptian age (Llopis Formation), with a discontinuous siliciclastic member at its top; followedby late Early, to Late Aptian hemipelagic marls andmarlstones (Almadich Formation); andthen by renewed carbonate platform development of Late Aptian to earliest Albian age (Seguilí Formation)

The initiation of seafloor spreading in the North Atlantic, which started very early in the Cretaceous, led to a decrease in the sinistral movement between Iberia and Africa that had prevailed during part of the Jurassic (Ziegler, 1988), and to a phase of rapid anti-clockwise rotation of Iberia relative to Europe that would culminate in seafloor spreading in the Bay of Biscay from middle Aptian times onwards (Olivet, 1996; Vergès and García-Senz, 2001)

That extensional tectonism experienced a strong phase during the latest Jurassic to the Hauterivian, followed, during the Barremian–Aptian, by an interval of lesser tectonic movements but larger subsidence rates, which favoured the development of wide and thick carbonate platforms (including the Urgonian facies) in the shallow areas of the basins (GarcíaHernández et al., 1980; Vilas et al., 2001; García-Hernández et al., 2001, 2003; Martín-Chivelet et al., 2002; Vera, 2004; Castro et al., 2008).
