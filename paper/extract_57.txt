But in reality there is no contradiction: prior to the Pleistocene period the northern hemisphere of the Earth experienced an even damp or wet–dry tropical climate during the Tertiary and—for Europe—the northern palm limit was as high as 62uN (Schwarzbach 1988)In situ chemical weathering of rocks and sediments under these conditions produced a thick (

For the Pleistocene glaciers it was quite easy to strip this regolith like a blanket from the unweathered, solid rock, and much of the weathered soft material became rearranged as glacial sedimentThis remobilization may also explain an unsolved problem raised by Bull et al

The very low percentage of chattermark trails in glacial sediments from New Zealand (mountain glaciers) versus the high percentage found in Pleistocene ice-sheet deposits from the northern hemisphere (Gravenor 1979) is consistent with the coupled physical– chemical weathering model of the origin of chattermark trailsFor example, the glacial sediments in New Zealand were produced from fresh, almost unweathered rocks and cannot, based on the model presented here, carry any chattermark trails because the chemical phase is missing
