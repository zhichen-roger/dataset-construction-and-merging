In order to explore these relationships, a modified Gazzi–Dickinson point-counting technique was used to analyze the composition of 143 Mesozoic sandstone samples from the southern Junggar, northern Tarim, and western Turpan basins of northwestern ChinaResults indicate that a Mesozoic, ancestral version of the Tian Shan physiographically separated the Junggar and Tarim basins and provided sand of very different composition to each basin
Results indicate that a Mesozoic, ancestral version of the Tian Shan physiographically separated the Junggar and Tarim basins and provided sand of very different composition to each basinMesozoic sandstone from the northern Tarim basin is diverse in composition and lithic-rich (Qm41F14L45; Qp42Lvm26Lsm32), is locally micaceous, and contains common radiolarian-chert grains and few dense accessory minerals

Inferred source rocks include upper Paleozoic alkali granite and metamorphic complexes, thick Silurian bedded-chert sequences, and lower Paleozoic strata of a passive continental marginIn contrast, sandstone from the southern Junggar and western Turpan basins is uniformly volcanic-rich (Qm21F21Lt58; Qp13Lvm68Lsm19), and contains abundant dense accessory minerals and only local radiolarian chert and mica
Inferred principal source rocks are Devonian–Carboniferous andesitic arc volcanics.The effect of sampling scale on sandstone composition outweighs that of plate-tectonic setting
In addition, though Mesozoic basins of western China were most akin to broken foreland basins, Mesozoic sandstone is considerably more compositionally diverse and lithic-rich than that of modern or ancient broken foreland basins because of the variety of accreted terranes constituting the ancestral Tian Shan.Temporal changes in sandstone composition are consistent with episodes of Mesozoic deformation in the Tian Shan
Temporal changes in sandstone composition are consistent with episodes of Mesozoic deformation in the Tian ShanEach deformational episode increased physiographic relief of the ancestral range, produced renewed downcutting and erosion of source rocks, and resulted in the deposition of compositionally very immature sandstone in adjacent basins
Although a regional early Mesozoic megamonsoon and an Early Cretaceous rain shadow cast across the northern Tarim basin are interpreted from regional facies and paleontologic data, neither paleoclimatic phenomenon appears to have significantly modified sandstone composition in the study area.Calculations of intergranular volume ( percent porosity 1  percent cement) indicate that porosity in sandstone from the Tarim and Junggar basin depocenters was reduced principally by burial compaction and that the rate of porosity reduction was highest for lithic-rich samples.
Most of this mosaic was assembled piecemeal during Phanerozoic time, as in-JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH, VOL
The Tian Shan complex was assembled during middle and late Paleozoic time and contains several distinct tectonic elements, including two major sutures (Fig1)
The ocean basin separating the Tarim and Ili Blocks closed during Devonian time in a poorly understood collision that produced a major angular unconformity in the northern Tarim basin (Carroll et al1995)
1), was formed by the Late Carboniferous–Permian accretion of the North Tian Shan–Bogda Shan arc system(s) to the northern side of the combined Ili/Tarim Blocks (Windley et al1990; Allen et al
This accretion terminated arc magmatism in the region, produced late Paleozoic thrusting in the northern Tian Shan (Allen et al1993), and resulted in widespread erosional unroofing and cooling of rocks now exposed in the core of the Tian Shan (Zhou 1997; T.A
By Early Permian time, erosional detritus from the ancestral Tian Shan was shed into the southern Junggar and northern Tarim basins (Carroll et al1990; Carroll et al
The idea of a Mesozoic Tian Shan has long been favored by Chinese geologists (e.g., Huang 1978), although this hypothesis has not been not universally accepted (e.g., Bally et al1986)
Several lines of stratigraphic evidence suggest that the Junggar and Tarim basins continued to be physiographically separated by the ancestral Tian Shan during Mesozoic time and that several relatively minor episodes of Mesozoic contractile deformation occurred in the area (Hendrix et al1992)
Isopach maps indicate that Mesozoic strata in the Junggar and Tarim basins thicken towards the range (Zhang et al1993; Gu 1994), suggesting that the ancestral Tian Shan was the source of sediment
Approximately 5600 m and 4700 m of Mesozoic nonmarine siliciclastic strata are exposed in the upturned flanks of the southern Junggar and northern Tarim basins, respectively, attesting to the importance of tectonic subsidenceBoth the Ili and the Turpan intermontane basins (Fig
1) contain Mesozoic stratal patterns indicating syndeformational ponding of sediment (Graham et al1994), and there are several intra-Mesozoic angular unconformities in the Turpan basin (Greene et al
1994), and there are several intra-Mesozoic angular unconformities in the Turpan basin (Greene et al1997).
In addition to preserving a record of central Asian tectonism, Mesozoic nonmarine strata in basins of northwestern Chinese contain a remarkable record of both regional and local Mesozoic paleoclimate (Hendrix et al1992; Greene et al
Regional Lower through Middle Jurassic organic-rich strata record well-watered environments associated with a monsoonal circulation (Hendrix et al1992)
In contrast, Upper Jurassic redbeds record a regional increase in aridity and cessation of monsoonal circulation (Parrish 1993)The presence of thick Lower Cretaceous redbeds in the northern Tarim basin and coeval regional lacustrine deposits in the southern Junggar basin was interpreted by Hendrix et al

Analyses of primary apatite from plutonic and metamorphic rocks and detrital apatite from sandstone in the Tian Shan indicate that most of the range has undergone less than ø3 km of total exhumation during Mesozoic and Cenozoic time (Zhou 1997; T.ADumitru, personal communication 1999)

Lastly, I describe relationships among porosity, burial depth, and sandstone composition in order to provide information about the petroleum reservoir quality of Mesozoic sandstone.Sandstone samples were collected from Mesozoic strata exposed along the upturned flanks of the southern Junggar, northern Tarim, and western Turpan basins (Fig
Sandstone samples were collected from Mesozoic strata exposed along the upturned flanks of the southern Junggar, northern Tarim, and western Turpan basins (Fig1)
Most samples were collected from the Junggar and Tarim basin depocenters at Manas and Kuqa, respectively, where complete Mesozoic sections are exposedIn addition, samples were collected away from depocenter regions and across the western Turpan basin as exposure and access permitted.
Although dating of Mesozoic nonmarine strata in the study area is difficult because of a lack of interbedded, datable volcanic units and little reported magnetostratigraphic work (but see McFadden et al1988a,

Along with biostratigraphic and lithostratigraphic summaries of Mesozoic strata in western China (Zhang 1981; Chen 1985b), these paleontologic results form the basis for age control in this study.The composition of sand-size detritus in ancient sedimentary rocks may be influenced by numerous possible variables, including the composition of source terrane(s) (e.g., Cavazza et al
In tectonically active settings such as that inferred for the study area during Mesozoic time (Wang et al1990; Hendrix et al
Mesozoic sandstone from the Junggar, Tarim, and Turpan basins is characterized by several broad similarities as well as some marked differences, which provide the basis for interpretations regarding the relative influence of paleoclimate, depositional setting, and tectonic history on sandstone composition.Lithic Grains.—Sandstone from all three basins is lithic-rich (Tarim Qm41F14L45; Junggar Qm20F20L60; Turpan Qm20F25L55; Fig
In contrast, Mesozoic samples from Tarim have diverse lithic compositions and are dominated by Qp (including chert), Ls, and Lm, and contain subordinate amounts of volcanic rock fragments (Tarim Qp42Lvm26Lsm32)The standard deviation (1s) for modal Qp, Lvm, and Lsm in Tarim basin samples is outside that of samples from both the Junggar and Turpan basins (Appendix 2; Fig
Evidence for a Mesozoic Ancestral Tian Shan—Regional Distribution of Source Rocks and Specific Provenance IndicatorsVariations in Mesozoic sandstone composition among basins of western China provides strong evidence for an ancestral, Mesozoic version of the Tian Shan
Variations in Mesozoic sandstone composition among basins of western China provides strong evidence for an ancestral, Mesozoic version of the Tian ShanMany of the observed variations in sandstone composition are most easily explained through the erosion of source terranes that occur in the Tian Shan complex
2B) resulted from erosion of Precambrian and upper Paleozoic granite, lower Paleozoic passive-continental-margin strata, and high-grade metamorphic rock assemblagesThe scatter in lithic data is consistent with the diverse source-rock types interpreted for the northern Tarim basin
These rock types are inferred to have cropped out on the southern flanks of the Mesozoic Tian Shan but to have been largely lacking on the northern flanks (Fig1)
In contrast, the consistently Lv-rich character of sandstone from the Turpan and Junggar basins resulted from erosion of Devonian through Carboniferous arc volcanics that cropped out along the northern flank of the Mesozoic Tian Shan and the entire Mesozoic Bogda Shan, a distribution similar to that of today (Fig1)
Devonian–Carboniferous arc volcanics are interpreted to have cropped out only locally on the southern flanks of the Mesozoic Tian Shan, and hence were a comparatively minor source of clastic debris shed into the northern Tarim basin during Mesozoic time.Specific Source-Rock Indicators.—Several distinct grain types in the study suite can be used as specific provenance indicators for the Mesozoic Tian Shan
Specific Source-Rock Indicators.—Several distinct grain types in the study suite can be used as specific provenance indicators for the Mesozoic Tian ShanUnusually abundant potassium feldspar is found in Paleozoic sandstone (Carroll et al
Unusually abundant potassium feldspar is found in Paleozoic sandstone (Carroll et al1995), Mesozoic sandstone (this study), and modern sands (Graham et al
1995), Mesozoic sandstone (this study), and modern sands (Graham et al1993) from basins of northwestern China
Potassium feldspar was likely derived from a suite of Permian alkali granite and rhyolite containing potassium feldspar phenocrysts that are widespread in the southern Tian Shan (Fig1; Chen 1985a; Coleman 1989; Carroll et al
For example, both potassium feldspar and granitic rock fragments are negligible, if present, in Triassic strata of the Kuqa sectionBoth grain types first appear in significant quantities in Lower Jurassic strata and are present throughout the younger Mesozoic section
Both grain types first appear in significant quantities in Lower Jurassic strata and are present throughout the younger Mesozoic sectionAlthough highly potassium-feldspar-rich sandstone is not common in the rock record, Ingersoll and Cavazza (1991) described potassium-feldsparrich sandstone from local stream systems draining a rhyolitic volcanic center in the Rio Grande Rift
Thick bedded chert, probably in part structurally telescoped, occurs in the Silurian section of the south Tian Shan (Zhang 1981; Chen 1985a; Zhou 1997)In the present study, detrital radiolarian chert was identified in sandstone from each section in the northern Tarim basin except the Awate River locality (Fig

These grains are interpreted to have been derived from Permian alkali granites in the ancestral Tian ShanTheir occurrence parallels that of potassium feldspar in samples from the northern Tarim and southern Junggar
Tarim is inferred to have been eroded from Silurian chert in the southern flank of the Mesozoic Tian ShanIn contrast, radiolarian chert is uncommon and occurs inconsistently in sections from the southern Junggar and Turpan basins, suggesting that Mesozoic streams draining the northern flank of the Tian Shan did not have access to the widespread Silurian chert sequences in the southern Tian Shan

Rather, radiolarian chert in the Junggar and Turpan basins was likely derived from structural slivers of Devonian ophiolite that are present throughout much of the Tian Shan (Chen 1985a; Wang et al1990)
Particularly high percentages of detrital mica in the northwestern Tarim basin and the abundance of dense minerals across the study area also may be related to specific source terranes in the Mesozoic Tian ShanPercentages of mica in the Awate River and Baicheng sections average 5.9 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively (Appendix 1)
Although diverse potential source rocks (e.g., late Paleozoic alkali feldspar-rich granite and adamellite; Lower Proterozoic plagiogranite and adamellite; Chen et al1985a) could have supplied the mica to these two localities, the most likely source is a belt of Proterozoic greenschist and local blueschist that occurs north and northeast of Aksu and Baicheng (Fig
1985a) could have supplied the mica to these two localities, the most likely source is a belt of Proterozoic greenschist and local blueschist that occurs north and northeast of Aksu and Baicheng (Fig1; Chen 1985a; Jia 1996; Zhou 1997)
These accessory minerals were probably derived principally from Carboniferous arc-related andesite that occurs widely in the northern parts of the Tian Shan and Kuruk Tagh and in the entire Bogda Shan, but only sporadically in the southern Tian Shan (Fig1).
Additional Support for a Mesozoic Tian Shan.—Three additional lines of independent evidence support the existence of a Mesozoic ancestral Tian ShanFirst, directional paleocurrent measurements from Mesozoic strata in the northern Tarim and southern Junggar basins (Hendrix et al

The existence of a Mesozoic ancestral Tian Shan also is consistent with evidence of local contractile Mesozoic deformation in the northwestern Junggar basin (Chang 1980; Lin 1984; Xie et al1984), in the southeastern Junggar basin (Li and Jiang 1987), and in the subsurface of the Tarim basin (Hendrix et al
Variations in the composition of framework grains through time yield considerable information regarding the history of the Mesozoic Tian ShanIn this study, analysis is focused on the thickest and most continuously exposed stratigraphic sections available in the southern Junggar basin (Manas section; Figs

Radiolarian chert grains are a common component of samples from the Kuqa section, where they are interpreted to have been derived from a thick sequence of Silurian bedded chert exposed in the ancestral southern Tian Shan.Mesozoic sandstone samples from the Manas section display several major temporal changes in the relative proportions of quartz, feldspar, and lithic grains (Fig
Mesozoic sandstone samples from the Manas section display several major temporal changes in the relative proportions of quartz, feldspar, and lithic grains (Fig4)
Triassic and Lower Jurassic sandstone is particularly rich in lithic detritusMiddle Jurassic sandstone is more quartzofeldspathic, but uppermost Jurassic sandstone is lithic-rich

Triassic samples at Manas are very volcaniclastic, similar to Permian samples downsection (Fig4; Carroll et al
Lower, Middle, and Upper Jurassic samples are successively more enriched in lithic sedimentary and metamorphic detritus and contain somewhat lower percentages of volcanic grains (Fig4)
Samples of lowermost Cretaceous strata are more Lvm-rich and Lsm-poor, but samples of Upper Cretaceous (K2d) strata display an increase in Lsm and a slight decrease in modal Lvm.Compositional changes in the relative proportions of quartz, feldspar, and lithic grains also are present in the Kuqa section (Fig
Triassic sandstone contains high percentages of total quartz and undifferentiated lithic fragmentsOverlying Lower and Middle Jurassic samples contain the lowest stratigraphic occurrence of significant potassium feldspar, are relatively enriched in total feldspar, and include a lower percentage of undifferentiated lithic grains
Overlying Lower and Middle Jurassic samples contain the lowest stratigraphic occurrence of significant potassium feldspar, are relatively enriched in total feldspar, and include a lower percentage of undifferentiated lithic grainsHowever, uppermost Jurassic samples (;3500 m mark in Figure 5) are enriched in lithic components and contain considerably less Qm and total feldspar than samples farther downsection

Lower Cretaceous samples are enriched in Lv, and Upper Cretaceous samples are rich in Ls.Significant changes in Mesozoic depositional setting across the study area, pollen data, and global climate models of central Asian basins all suggest the establishment of an early Mesozoic megamonsoonal circulation system across central Asia and the ending of that monsoonal circulation by latest Jurassic time (Hendrix et al
Significant changes in Mesozoic depositional setting across the study area, pollen data, and global climate models of central Asian basins all suggest the establishment of an early Mesozoic megamonsoonal circulation system across central Asia and the ending of that monsoonal circulation by latest Jurassic time (Hendrix et al1992; Parrish 1993)
Lower and Middle Jurassic coal-bearing meandering-fluvial and lacustrine facies are ubiquitous in central Asian basins and are interpreted to record monsoon-derived moisture (e.g., Hendrix et al1992; Hendrix et al
Regionally, these organic-rich strata are overlain by Upper Jurassic fine-grained redbeds that were deposited after the monsoonal climatic period (Vakhrameyev and Doludenko 1977; Hendrix et al1992; Ritts and Biffi 2000)
Supporting this interpretation is a marked Late Jurassic increase in the relative abundance of Classopolis sppollen derived from drought-tolerant Cheiralipidiaceaen conifers (Vakhrameyev 1982; Fig
Global climate models also predict an early Mesozoic megamonsoonal circulation pattern over central Asia (Kutzbach and Gallimore 1989; Parrish 1993) that ended by Early Cretaceous time (Parrish and Curtis 1982; Parrish 1985).Temporal changes in sandstone composition may be, in part, attributable to parallel changes in depositional setting and the intensity of chemical weathering resulting from establishment and ending of the megamonsoon, but it does not appear that these changes were the main factors influencing sandstone composition
At Manas, Lt-rich, Qt-poor Triassic sandstone deposited by gravelly braided rivers is overlain by Lower and Middle Jurassic meandering-fluvial and lacustrine sandstone containing appreciably greater percentages of Qt and total F and less Lt (Fig4)
Overlying Upper Jurassic sandstone collected from braided-fluvial redbeds is enriched in Lt and relatively depleted in Qt and FNumerous studies have concluded that firstcycle sand transported in a humid climate tends to be depleted in feldspar and rock fragments and enriched in quartz because of the intensity of chemical weathering (e.g., Basu 1976; Suttner and Dutta 1986; Johnsson et al
Whereas increased Qt and decreased Lt in Lower and Middle Jurassic sandstone is consistent with higher rates of chemical weathering during the monsoon, increased total F during this period is not, suggesting that sandstone composition was most influenced by factors other than climate.Broad compositional differences between Lower Cretaceous sandstone from the southern Junggar basin and the northern Tarim basin also suggest
Broad compositional differences between Lower Cretaceous sandstone from the southern Junggar basin and the northern Tarim basin also suggestFIG
6.—Summary of tectonic and paleoclimatologic factors interpreted to be important influences on the composition of Mesozoic sandstone from the Junggar, Tarim, and Turpan basinsFacies information is derived principally from Hendrix et al
(1992) interpreted that, during Early Cretaceous time, prevalent northerly winds cooled adiabatically as they were forced over the ancestral Tian ShanMost of the precipitation from northerly weather systems was shed north of the range in the Junggar basin, producing a regional system of well-oxygenated, oligotrophic lakes (‘‘overfilled lake basins’’ of Carroll and Bohacs 1999)
If depositional setting and climate had been major controls on sandstone composition, Lower Cretaceous sandstone on the windward side of the ancestral Tian Shan (Manas) should be enriched in stable components (particularly Qm) and depleted in less stable grains (Lvm, Lsm) as a result of chemical weathering (Suttner and Dutta 1986)Sandstone on the leeward side of the ancestral Tian Shan (Tarim) should be enriched in labile grains as a result of decreased chemical weathering associated with the rain shadow
Lower Cretaceous sandstone from the southern Junggar basin contains notably more QmFLt percentLt and less QmFLt percentQm than equivalent sandstone from the northern Tarim basin (Junggar 5 Qm24F23Lt51; Tarim Qm42F25Lt35; Appendix 1)Rather than reflecting differences in climate and the degree of chemical weathering associated with different depositional environments across the study area, Lower Cretaceous sandstone compositions likely record the distribution of source rocks flanking the northern and southern sides of the ancestral Tian Shan during Early Cretaceous time, as discussed above.
Rather than reflecting differences in climate and the degree of chemical weathering associated with different depositional environments across the study area, Lower Cretaceous sandstone compositions likely record the distribution of source rocks flanking the northern and southern sides of the ancestral Tian Shan during Early Cretaceous time, as discussed above.Observed correlations between sand/sandstone composition and platetectonic setting have led to the establishment of petrological models for provenance interpretation (e.g., Dickinson and Suczek 1979; Dickinson 1985, 1988)
Mesozoic strata deposited in marine environments are not present in the study area, and deposition by large streams draining the entire Tian Shan (third-order drainages) are unlikely, given the coarseness of sediment and their proximal character (Hendrix et al 1992)In order to test the hypothesis that the effect of sampling scale on sandstone composition outweighs that of plate-tectonic setting for sandstones from first-order and second-order drainages, the relationships between actual sandstone composition and that predicted from plate-tectonic petrofacies models (Dickinson and Suczek 1979) are explored below.
Mesozoic basins of western China were perhaps most analogous to the broken foreland basins of the Cordilleran Laramide Orogeny (e.g., Dickinson and Snyder 1978) or the modern Sierras Pampeanas of Argentina (e.g., Jordan et al1983)
Mesozoic basins of western China were situated in a retroarc position relative to active arcs on the south Asian continental margin (Dietrich et al1983; Zhang et al
1987), and contractile deformation of Mesozoic age (e.g., Li and Jiang 1987; Zhang et al1993; Hendrix et al
Despite structural similarities to modern broken foreland basins, the composition of Mesozoic sandstone is dissimilar to that reported from other modern and ancient broken foreland basinsSandstone from broken foreland basins of North America (Dickinson and Suczek 1979; Dickinson et al
Few Mesozoic samples from western China are quartzofeldspathicRather, samples from the Junggar and Turpan basins are lithic-rich and plot in the magmatic-arc and recycled-orogen provenance fields on Qm–F–Lt ternary diagrams (Fig
In this study, sandstone compositions reflect the diversity of basement rocks in the ancestral Tian Shan and the localized source-rock signatures produced by first-order and second-order drainages, rather than the Mesozoic plate-tectonic settingFor example, the magmatic-arc signature of samples from the Junggar and Turpan basins (Fig
2) resulted from erosion of the extinct Devonian–Carboniferous arc system in the northern Tian ShanSimilarly, temporal changes in the composition of Mesozoic sandstone (e.g., alternation between magmatic-arc and recycled-orogen signatures for the Junggar and Tarim basins; Hendrix 1992) probably do not signify major changes in plate-tectonic setting of the study area because there exists no evidence for such tectonic changes
Similarly, temporal changes in the composition of Mesozoic sandstone (e.g., alternation between magmatic-arc and recycled-orogen signatures for the Junggar and Tarim basins; Hendrix 1992) probably do not signify major changes in plate-tectonic setting of the study area because there exists no evidence for such tectonic changesRather, these changes likely resulted from variations in the supply of detritus from specific source rocks to each basin.
These include analysis of Cretaceous sandstone from a strike-slip basin in Alaska (Trop and Ridgway 1997), Cenozoic and modern sand/sandstone from southern California (Link 1982; Critelli et al1997; Rumelhart and Ingersoll 1997) and studies of modern sands from basins of western China (Graham et al
Influence of Episodic Mesozoic Deformation in the Tian ShanSandstone samples collected from coarse clastic strata at Manas and Kuqa show compositional shifts consistent with episodes of Mesozoic deformation in the Tian Shan (Hendrix et al
Sandstone samples collected from coarse clastic strata at Manas and Kuqa show compositional shifts consistent with episodes of Mesozoic deformation in the Tian Shan (Hendrix et al1992)
For example, Triassic sandstone from Kuqa is rich in metamorphic Qp and chert and poor in F and Lvm (Appendix 1)Samples from overlying Lower and Middle Jurassic strata contain notably less Qp and markedly more F and Lvm (Fig
Samples from overlying Lower and Middle Jurassic strata contain notably less Qp and markedly more F and Lvm (Fig5; Appendix 1)
These trends are best explained by a change from local Triassic drainage systems that tapped high-grade metamorphic rocks and Silurian chert sequences to better integrated Early and Middle Jurassic drainage systems that included Paleozoic volcanic rocks and lower Paleozoic passive-continental-margin strata (Fig6)
The sedimentary style and inferred paleoenvironments for Triassic through Middle Jurassic strata support these interpretationsTriassic strata consist of coarse-grained alluvial and braided-fluvial rocks deposited by high-gradient streams in presumably localized catchment basins
Triassic strata consist of coarse-grained alluvial and braided-fluvial rocks deposited by high-gradient streams in presumably localized catchment basinsLower and Middle Jurassic strata consist of coal-bearing meandering-fluvial and lacustrine deposits that record lower stream gradients and more fully developed, integrated drainage systems (Fig
Lower and Middle Jurassic strata consist of coal-bearing meandering-fluvial and lacustrine deposits that record lower stream gradients and more fully developed, integrated drainage systems (Fig6).
Compositional trends associated with uppermost Jurassic and Upper Cretaceous coarse alluvial strata at Kuqa and Manas also are consistent with the interpretation of Mesozoic deformation in the Tian ShanAt Manas, uppermost Jurassic sandstone is markedly enriched in Ls, relative to Lvdominated sandstone stratigraphically above and below (Fig
At Manas, uppermost Jurassic sandstone is markedly enriched in Ls, relative to Lvdominated sandstone stratigraphically above and below (Fig4; Appendix 1 1)
Upper Cretaceous strata in each section also is more Ls-rich than strata immediately downsection (Figs4, 5; Appendix 1)
This interpretation is supported by the presence of an angular unconformity in uppermost Jurassic strata in the southern Turpan basin and unpublished seismic reflection profiles from the Turpan that show uppermost Jurassic strata to be regionally folded and overlain by relatively undeformed Lower Cretaceous strata (TGreene, written communication, 1997).

These results are somewhat lower than published direct porosity measurements for Mesozoic sandstone from the southeastern Junggar basin (Tang et al1997b) and the Manas area (Hu et al
Indeed, the larger average intergranular volume for Turpan samples is consistent with thinner Mesozoic and Cenozoic sequences in that basin (Hendrix et al1992).
Upper Triassic and uppermost Jurassic sandstone samples from the Manas section deviate from the overall trend, however, containing less intergranular porosity than expected (Fig7)
Broad differences in Mesozoic sandstone compositions between the northern Tarim and southern Junggar basins strongly suggest that the two basins were physiographically separated throughout Mesozoic time by an ancestral version of the Tian ShanSandstone from the northern Tarim basin is quartzolithic and contains high percentages of Qp, Lm, and Ls
Tarim sandstone was derived from diverse Precambrian and Paleozoic metamorphic complexes, deformed lower Paleozoic radiolarian-chert sequences, upper Paleozoic alkali granite, and volcanic-arc rocks that cropped out on the southern flanks of the Mesozoic Tian ShanIn contrast, sandstone from the southern Junggar and Turpan basins is dominated by volcaniclastic detritus, reflecting the erosion of Devonian through Carboniferous arc volcanics that cropped out on the northern flank of the ancestral Tian Shan.

Mesozoic paleoclimate was not a dominant influence in shaping framework-grain compositions of the study suite, and overall trends in framework-grain compositions predicted from facies distributions and the likely degree of chemical weathering associated with specific paleoenvironments were not observedNeither the signature of a megamonsoonal climate, interpreted for central Asia during the early Mesozoic, nor the signature of an Early Cretaceous rain shadow in the northern Tarim basin (Hendrix et al
Neither the signature of a megamonsoonal climate, interpreted for central Asia during the early Mesozoic, nor the signature of an Early Cretaceous rain shadow in the northern Tarim basin (Hendrix et al1992) were distinguishable in sandstone compositional data.
Mesozoic basins of western China were probably most analogous to broken foreland basins, but sandstone compositions are lithic-rich and reflect diverse source rocks in accreted terranes of the ancestral Tian Shan, rather than derivation from granitic basement, as in modern and Tertiary broken foreland settings.A signature of episodic Mesozoic deformation of the ancestral Tian Shan is preserved in Mesozoic sandstone compositions
A signature of episodic Mesozoic deformation of the ancestral Tian Shan is preserved in Mesozoic sandstone compositionsUpper Triassic, uppermost Jurassic, and Upper Cretaceous sandstone collected from coarse, synorogenic alluvial and braided-fluvial strata is particularly lithic-rich because of the establishment of local drainage systems that tapped specific source terranes and the short residence times for sand in the evolving ancestral Tian Shan orogen
Upper Triassic, uppermost Jurassic, and Upper Cretaceous sandstone collected from coarse, synorogenic alluvial and braided-fluvial strata is particularly lithic-rich because of the establishment of local drainage systems that tapped specific source terranes and the short residence times for sand in the evolving ancestral Tian Shan orogenAbundant Ls in coarse uppermost Jurassic and Upper Cretaceous strata likely reflects cannibalization of fine-grained sedimentary strata immediately downsection.
Abundant Ls in coarse uppermost Jurassic and Upper Cretaceous strata likely reflects cannibalization of fine-grained sedimentary strata immediately downsection.Calculations of intergranular volume ( percent pore space 1  percent cement) indicate that sandstones from the Junggar and Tarim basins could be good petroleum reservoirs, provided that burial has not been excessive
