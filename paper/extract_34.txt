Considering the relatively abundant Early Jurassic detrital and igneous zircons (Figure 10), we suggest that the earliest prevalent arc magmatism took place during the Early Jurassic (Figure 12), which is conformed by the age of the ophiolites in the BNSZ dated mainly in the Early– Middle Jurassic (Wang et al2016).

In addition, the mainly northern detrital source of the Shamuluo Formation possibly indicates that the topography of the Qiangtang terrane was higher than that of the Lhasa terrane, caused by northward subduction of the Bangong–Nujiang oceanic crust during the JurassicMoreover, this conclusion is supported by the transition in sedimentary facies in the Nima area from marine to non-marine at 125–118 Ma (Kapp et al

As for the late Early Cretaceous (120– 108) OIB-type basaltic rocks and interbedded limestones within the BNSZ, which have been interpreted to indicate the presence of ocean islands and are then the key evidence of the collision after the Early Cretaceous (Fan et al2014; Zhang et al

Although this study cannot completely exclude the possibility that the Bangong–Nujiang Ocean still opened during the Early Cretaceous, combined with the stratigraphic, structural, and magmatic evidence described above, we tend to think that the Lhasa– Qiangtang collision took place in the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, most likely 140–130 Ma.Consequently, if collision did take place at 140–130 Ma, the late Early Cretaceous (125–100 Ma) magmatic rocks on both sides of the BNSZ (Figure 1(b)) were possibly related to events that occurred after closure of the ocean (Xu et al

Consequently, if collision did take place at 140–130 Ma, the late Early Cretaceous (125–100 Ma) magmatic rocks on both sides of the BNSZ (Figure 1(b)) were possibly related to events that occurred after closure of the ocean (Xu et al1985; Harris et al

We suggest that the late Early Cretaceous magmatic rocks could be produced by slab break-off or lithospheric delamination during this period, which is supported by the presence of ca.110 Ma A-type granites identified in the middle segment of the BNSZ (Qu et al2012) and high crustal temperature indicated by the felsic magmatic rocks in the North Lhasa terrane (Harris et al

In addition, the εHf(t) values of the Late Mesozoic detrital zircons from all samples vary from –18.95 to 13.26 with the majority of them being weakly positive, which are similar to those of the Late Mesozoic arc magmatic rocks in the South Qiangtang terraneThus, U–Pb ages and Hf isotopic data of detrital zircons suggest that Jurassic–Early Cretaceous strata around the Bangong–Nujiang suture zone were derived from the north, which is conformed by the north-to-south palaeocurrent

Thus, U–Pb ages and Hf isotopic data of detrital zircons suggest that Jurassic–Early Cretaceous strata around the Bangong–Nujiang suture zone were derived from the north, which is conformed by the north-to-south palaeocurrentThis finding is consistent with the tectonic context of northward subduction of the Bangong–Nujiang oceanic crust during the Jurassic.
