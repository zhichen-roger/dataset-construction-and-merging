U-Pb detrital-zircon ages (n = 576) from six Huizachal Group sandstones (fi ve from La Boca and one from La Joya) consist of four groups indicating a mixed provenance: (1) Grenville grains (~1.3–1.0 Ga) derived from Gondwana (Novillo Gneiss); (2) earlymiddle Paleozoic grains (430–300 Ma) derived from peri-Gondwanan accreted rocks (Granjeno Schist); (3) Permo-Triassic grains (296–222 Ma) derived from volcanic and plutonic rocks (West Pangaean arc) and/or turbidites (Guacamaya Formation); and (4) Early-Middle Jurassic grains (199– 164 Ma), locally derived from the Nazas arcGroups 1–3 increase in abundance upsection as a result of unroofi ng of Jurassic volcanic and sedimentary carapace from uplifted basement.

Detrital zircon ages in the lower member of the La Boca Formation in Valle de Huizachal corroborate previous inferences of an Early to Middle Jurassic age for the La Boca Formation (Clark et al., 1994; Fastovsky et al., 1995, 2005; Stewart et al., 1999; Barboza-Gudiño et al., 2008)Our data further indicates that the upper member of the La Boca Formation is at least in part Middle Jurassic, consistent with inferences drawn from vertebrate fossils recovered near the base of the member (Clark et al., 1994; Fastovsky et al., 1995), and that the La Joya Formation was deposited near the end of the Middle Jurassic and is probably Callovian.
