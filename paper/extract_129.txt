The Nacimiento Franciscan belt is an allochthonous sliver of subduction assemblages in the central California Coast Ranges displaced either: (1) from southern California by >300 km of Neogene dextral slip along the San Andreas fault system or (2) from central California to southern California and back again, by >500 km of Late Cretaceous–Paleocene sinistral slip along the Sur-Nacimiento fault followed by San Andreas–related motionNew U-Pb detrital zircon data from 20 (meta)clastic samples indicate that the Nacimiento Franciscan section was assembled between ca

Abundant Cretaceous (particularly Late Cretaceous) and diminishing amounts of Jurassic and Proterozoic zircon grains point to a southern California origin for Nacimiento Franciscan protoliths, precluding significant sinistral strike-slip along the Sur-Nacimiento faultFurthermore, the suite of detrital zircon ages reported here bears a strong resemblance to new and existing data from subduction complexes in southern California that were emplaced during Laramide shallow subduction (i.e., Sierra de Salinas, Portal Ridge, Quartz Hill, Rand, San Emigdio, and Tehachapi schists)

Hence, the Nacimiento Franciscan is distinct from Franciscan rocks in central and northern California and more likely represents an outboard element of the Late Cretaceous southern California low-angle subduction systemUpon restoring the Nacimiento block to its Late Cretaceous position, an inboard-younging trend is apparent in the composite Nacimiento–southern California schist belt, suggesting that progressively younger accretionary materials were underplated farther inboard by tectonic erosion

Profound along­ and across­strike variations in accretionary belt character reflect the dynamic nature of Mesozoic subduction beneath western North AmericaFor example, the northern Coast Ranges and San Francisco Bay Area contain a downward­ and westward­younging (Early Cretaceous to middle Miocene) high­pressure/low­temperature (HP/LT) structural sequence juxtaposed with forearc sediments (Unruh et al., 2007; Ernst et al., 2009; Snow et al., 2010; Dumitru et al., 2010, 2015; Wakabayashi, 2015)

Other workers suggest minimal trench­parallel displacement within the Nacimiento Franciscan, instead positing that these rocks were thrust beneath Cretaceous forearc basin and  batholithic rocks in southern California (Page, 1970a, 1970b; Hall, 1991; Saleeby, 2003; Ducea et al., 2009; Hall and Saleeby, 2013)The origin of the Naci miento Franciscan is disputed since, by comparison with the trench­forearc­arc triad east of the San Andreas fault, the juxtaposition of arc rocks of the Salinian block with Nacimiento assemblages along the Sur­Nacimiento fault implies the removal of a width of 150 km or greater of formerly intervening arc and forearc basin assemblages

Although general agreement exists that major displacements along this structure took place between 75 and 56 Ma (e.g., Dickinson et al., 2005; Jacobson et al., 2011), with late Cenozoic strike­slip remobilization linked to the San Andreas fault system (Hall, 1991), there is no consensus on the  nature of Late Cretaceous to Paleocene slip along the fault.The key aim here is to evaluate the thrust versus sinistral strike­slip models for the Sur­Nacimiento fault

High­pressure/low­temperature mineral assemblages and thrust structures preserved in the Diablo Range and in Franciscan assemblages in northern California are widely regarded to reflect progressive underplating and metamorphism attending subduction of the oceanic Farallon plate beneath North America from Middle to Late Cretaceous time (Ernst, 1970, 1993; Mattinson and Echeverria, 1980; Unruh et al., 2007; Ernst et al., 2009; Snow et al., 2010; Dumitru et al., 2010, 2015; Wakabayashi, 2015).The Rand, San Emigdio, and Sierra de Salinas schists (referred to in aggregate as “the Rand­type schist”) and similar early Cenozoic Pelona and Orocopia schists of more southerly California crop out along detachment structures beneath older crystalline rocks of the SW Cordilleran batholithic belt (Graham and England, 1976; Haxel and Dillon, 1978; Ehlig, 1981; Jacobson, 1983, 1995; Jacobson et al., 1988, 2007, 2011; Simpson, 1990; Kidder and Ducea, 2006;  Ducea et al., 2009; Chapman et al., 2010, 2011, 2012)

The lack of significant proportions of pre­Early Cretaceous grains strongly suggests a source for Group 1A detritus within the western Sierran­Peninsular Ranges magmatic arc, which at the time of deposition must have served as a topographic barrier, blocking craton interior debris from reaching the trench (e.g., Jacobson et al., 2011; Sharman et al., 2015).In comparison with Group 1A sandstones, turbidite systems represented by Group 1B samples are ~5 m.y

Franciscan assemblages outside the Nacimiento block also display significant variations in accretion rate; but these took place chiefly in Early Cretaceous time (Dumitru et al., 2010; Ernst, 2011) and are tentatively attributed to changes in convergence vectors between North America and outboard oceanic plates (Engebretson et al., 1985; Seton et al., 2012).If the Nacimiento block is, as we suggest, a product of Laramide shallow subduction (see footnote 1), then why was the trench preserved while the forearc and western magmatic arc were apparently obliterated by oceanic plateau collision? In comparison with the trench­forearc­arc system preserved east of the San Andreas fault in central California, inner forearc and western arc elements are scarce in Late Cretaceous reconstructions of southern California (Page, 1981; Dickinson, 1983; Hall, 1991; James et al., 1993; Schott and Johnson, 1998; Schott et al., 2004; Dickinson et al., 2005; Jacobson et al., 2011; Chapman et al., 2012; Sharman et al., 2015)
