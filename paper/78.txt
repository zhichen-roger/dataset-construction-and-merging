This, for example, is well reflected by the finding of Hadean and Eoarchaean zircons in metasediments of the Jack Hills and the Limpopo Belt, respectively (e.gMaas et al
Detrital zircons of both samples document Palaeoarchaean crust– mantle evolution but show no evidence of juvenile Eoarchaean or even Hadean crust in the source areaThus, evidence for such an old hinterland in southern Africa is at present documented only by detrital zircons from c
