De trital zircon U-Pb geochronology of Paleozoic strata in the Grand Canyon, ArizonaGeorge E
We determined U-Pb ages for detrital zircons from 26 samples of Paleozoic sandstone from the Grand CanyonCambrian strata yield mainly ca
Cambrian strata yield mainly ca1.44 and 1.7–1.8 Ga ages that indicate derivation from nearby basement rocks of the Yavapai Province
Devonian strata contain zircons of 1.6–1.8 Ga, 1.34–1.40 Ga, and ca520 Ma, suggesting derivation from the Mazatzal and Yavapai Provinces, midcontinent region, and the Amarillo-Wichita uplift, respectively
Mississippian strata record a major change in provenance, with predominantly 415–475 Ma and 1030– 1190 Ma grains interpreted to have been shed from the central Appalachian orogenPennsylvanian strata contain subequal proportions of 1.4–1.8 Ga grains derived from basement rocks exposed in the Ancestral Rocky Mountains and 409–464 and ca
Pennsylvanian strata contain subequal proportions of 1.4–1.8 Ga grains derived from basement rocks exposed in the Ancestral Rocky Mountains and 409–464 and ca1070 Ma grains derived from the Appalachians
Permian strata contain abundant Appalachian zircons, including 270–380 Ma grains, and a lesser proportion of grains derived from the Ancestral Rocky MountainsTranscontinental transport during Mississippian through Permian time is interpreted to have occurred in large river systems, facilitated by northeasterly trade winds during low sea level and by coastal currents
Transcontinental transport during Mississippian through Permian time is interpreted to have occurred in large river systems, facilitated by northeasterly trade winds during low sea level and by coastal currentsA compilation of young ages from all Upper Paleozoic strata yields age peaks of 270–365 Ma, 395–475 Ma, and 515–640 Ma, an excellent match for Alleghanian, Acadian, Taconic, and Neoproterozoic (peri-Gondwanan) episodes of magmatism along the Appalachian margin
A compilation of young ages from all Upper Paleozoic strata yields age peaks of 270–365 Ma, 395–475 Ma, and 515–640 Ma, an excellent match for Alleghanian, Acadian, Taconic, and Neoproterozoic (peri-Gondwanan) episodes of magmatism along the Appalachian marginLag times of the youngest grains in these Upper Paleozoic strata average ~25 m.y., suggesting relatively rapid exhumation and erosion of Appalachian source regions.

1) provide an excellent opportunity to determine the provenance of Cambrian through Permian sandstones of the southwestern United StatesThese strata have been studied by many geologists during the past 140 yr, including the pioneering work of J.W
Although there have been many thorough and detailed analyses of Grand Canyon strata, there are few constraints on the provenance of sandstones that make up much of the ~1300 m of Paleozoic stratigraphy (Fig2)
For Cambrian strata, regional studies of paleogeography, facies patterns, and paleotransport indicators (e.g., cross-beds) have suggested that most of the sand was derived from Precambrian basement within and east of the Grand Canyon (e.g., McKee and Resser, 1945; and as summarized by Middleton et al., 2003)Similar criteria from
Pennsylvanian and Permian sandstones generally supported the conclusion that most sand was derived from the Ancestral Rocky Mountains of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona and/or from basement uplifts farther north (Peterson, 1988; Blakey, 1988; Blakey et al., 1988; Marzolf, 1988; Johansen, 1988)Johansen (1988) considered the Appalachian orogen as a possible source but preferred derivation from northern cratonic sources based on paleogeographic considerations
This study uses detrital zircon geochronology to place additional constraints on the origin and transport history of Cambrian, Devonian, Mississippian, Pennsylvanian, and Permian sandstones in the Grand CanyonOur approach involves determining the ages of zircon crystals from each unit, comparing these age distributions with the ages of rocks in possible source terranes, and using available facies, paleocurrent, and paleogeographic information to reconstruct possible pathways of sediment transport

The Tapeats Sandstone is the lower unit of the Tonto Group, a classic transgressive sequence of Cambrian age (Fig2)
These strata rest unconformably on Precambrian crystalline basement of the 1.75–1.73 Ga Granite Gorge metamorphic suite (Karlstrom et al., 2003), various Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic plutons, and Middle–Upper Proterozoic strata of the Grand Canyon Supergroup (Hendricks and Stevenson, 2003; Ford and Dehler, 2003)Thickness of the Tapeats Sandstone in the Grand Canyon area generally ranges from 0 m to 122 m (Middleton et al., 2003; Billingsley, 2000)
These strata become younger eastward from late Early to early Middle Cambrian age (Middleton et al., 2003)Facies patterns suggest deposition in intertidal to subtidal shallow-marine environments, with local beach and fl uvial deposits (McKee and Resser, 1945; Hereford, 1977; Middleton and Hereford, 1981; Middleton et al., 2003)
The Middle Cambrian Muav is interpreted to have accumulated in subtidal to peritidal environments with deeper-water basins surrounding local offshore shoals (Middleton et al., 2003).The Temple Butte Formation consists of limestone, dolomite, mudstone, sandstone, and conglomerate that crop out in a discontinuous layer between the Muav and Redwall limestones (Beus, 2003a)
It ranges from 120 m to 245 m in thickness and rests unconformably on Cambrian (Muav) or, locally, Devonian (Temple Butte) strataThe Redwall formed in a shallow and broad epeiric sea on the western shelf of North America (Beus, 2003b).
Supai Group (Lower Pennsylvanian through Lower Permian)The Supai Group consists of a highly variable assemblage of clastic and carbonate rocks that accumulated on a broad coastal plain during early Pennsylvanian (or possibly latest Mississippian) through Early Permian time (McKee, 1982; Blakey, 2003)
The Supai Group consists of a highly variable assemblage of clastic and carbonate rocks that accumulated on a broad coastal plain during early Pennsylvanian (or possibly latest Mississippian) through Early Permian time (McKee, 1982; Blakey, 2003)The primary characteristic of the unit is interlayering of cliff-forming sandstones and limestones with slope-forming siltstones and mudstones
This is somewhat surprising given that the lower sample is part of the basal conglomerate, resting directly on Precambrian basement, whereas the upper unit likely formed in a more integrated drainage system.Three samples of fi ne-grained sandstone were collected from ~1 m above the Tapeats Sandstone (lower Bright Angel) and from ~5 m (Bright Angel) and ~3 m (upper Bright Angel) below the top of the unit (Fig
The ages from these samples are quite different from ages in underlying units, with signifi cant age groups in the early Paleozoic (400– 500 Ma) and mid-Proterozoic (1.0–1.2 Ga), and reduced proportions of 1.40–1.46 Ga and 1.6– 1.8 Ga ages (Figs5 and 6)
The resulting ages are mostly Precambrian, with only two ages between 400 and 450 Ma, 24 ages between 1.0 and 1.2 Ga, 32 ages between 1.6 and 1.8 Ga, and 22 ages between 1.8 and 3.0 Ga (Figs4 and 5).
The six sets of ages are accordingly combined on Figure 6 into two age distributions of Pennsylvanian age and earliest Permian (Wolfcampian) ageThese two age distributions are similar (K-S P value of 0.41; Table DR2 [see footnote 1]), with main groupings of early Paleozoic, mid-Proterozoic, and Early Proterozoic ages (Fig
These two age distributions are similar (K-S P value of 0.41; Table DR2 [see footnote 1]), with main groupings of early Paleozoic, mid-Proterozoic, and Early Proterozoic ages (Fig6)
The proportions of ages are somewhat different, however, in that there is a higher proportion of Early Proterozoic ages in the younger strataThis results in signifi cantly different cumulative probability curves for the Surprise Canyon versus Supai sample sets (Fig
Dominant age groups are generally similar in the three samples, with dominant groups of mid- and Early Proterozoic and an extended range of Late Proterozoic– early Paleozoic ages (Fig5)
The grains in these samples are very similar to ages of crystalline basement rocks throughout the southwestern United States, with dominantly Early Proterozoic grains (peak age = 1728 Ma; n = 102) and a lower proportion of 1.4–1.5 Ga grains (peak age = 1452 Ma; n = 65)In fact, 69 percent of the Early Proterozoic grains are interpreted to have been shed from the 1.70– 1.80 Ga (Yavapai) province, with 31 percent derived from the 1.62–1.70 Ga (Mazatzal) province (Fig
In fact, 69 percent of the Early Proterozoic grains are interpreted to have been shed from the 1.70– 1.80 Ga (Yavapai) province, with 31 percent derived from the 1.62–1.70 Ga (Mazatzal) province (Fig7; Karlstrom et al., 2003)
Comparison of these ages with ages in Proterozoic strata of the locally underlying Grand Canyon Supergroup (Unkar and Chuar Groups; Fig6) suggests that little detritus was recycled from underlying units.
The slightly greater proportion of 1.62–1.70 Ga grains (35 percent) over 1.70–1.80 Ga grains (65 percent) may refl ect cratonward migration of source regions during Cambrian transgressionTemple Butte
The Temple Butte Formation yields Paleoproterozoic and Mesoproterozoic ages that are similar to those in the Tapeats and Bright Angel Formations, even with similar proportions of 1.62–1.70 Ga (30 percent) versus 1.70–1.80 Ga (70 percent) grains (Fig6)
Most of the detritus is accordingly interpreted to also have been shed from Precambrian basement rocks of the southwestern United States.Additional sources are recorded by grains of 1.34–1.40 Ga (age peak at 1376 Ma) and 502–521 Ma (age peak of 518 Ma; n = 8) in all three samples, and grains of 403 and 426 Ma in sample 1
7), which contains granitic bodies of Cambrian age (Ham et al., 1964; Gilbert and Denison, 1993; Riggs et al., 1996; Hogan and Gilbert, 1998)However, this interpretation is somewhat problematic given the lack of mid-Proterozoic ages (1.0–1.2 Ga) in these samples, which would be expected from a source in the Texas-Oklahoma region
However, this interpretation is somewhat problematic given the lack of mid-Proterozoic ages (1.0–1.2 Ga) in these samples, which would be expected from a source in the Texas-Oklahoma regionThere is also no evidence that the Cambrian igneous rocks were exposed during Devonian time; the main phase of uplift of the Amarillo-Wichita uplift was during Pennsylvanian time as part of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains (Johnson et al., 1988; Gilbert and Denison, 1993).
There is also no evidence that the Cambrian igneous rocks were exposed during Devonian time; the main phase of uplift of the Amarillo-Wichita uplift was during Pennsylvanian time as part of the Ancestral Rocky Mountains (Johnson et al., 1988; Gilbert and Denison, 1993).An alternative interpretation is that the ca
(2010) reported similar ages from Devonian foreland basin strata of the AppalachiansThis interpretation is also problematic in that early Paleozoic detrital zircons shed from circum–North American orogenic belts are always accompanied by a signifi cant (generally greater) proportion of Grenvilleage grains
This interpretation is also problematic in that early Paleozoic detrital zircons shed from circum–North American orogenic belts are always accompanied by a signifi cant (generally greater) proportion of Grenvilleage grainsThe possibility of derivation from circum–North American orogenic systems is described in more detail later herein because younger units contain abundant Paleozoic and mid-Proterozoic zircons.

7), onto the North American craton, during Mississippian and Pennsylvanian time (Burchfi el et al., 1992)Detrital zircons in Mississippian strata that accumulated within and east of the highlands yield only Precambrian ages (Gehrels and Dickinson, 2000) and are a good match for rocks exposed in the Antler Highlands (Gehrels et al., 2000)
Detrital zircons in Mississippian strata that accumulated within and east of the highlands yield only Precambrian ages (Gehrels and Dickinson, 2000) and are a good match for rocks exposed in the Antler Highlands (Gehrels et al., 2000)However, because there is little overlap of these ages with the detrital zircon ages in Upper Paleozoic strata of the Grand Canyon, the Antler orogen is not a likely source for the Grand Canyon strata (Fig
However, because there is little overlap of these ages with the detrital zircon ages in Upper Paleozoic strata of the Grand Canyon, the Antler orogen is not a likely source for the Grand Canyon strata (Fig8).
Derivation from the north is also possible given that tectonism, referred to as the Franklinian, Innuitian, and Ellesmere orogenic events, occurred along the Arctic margin during mid- and late Paleozoic time (Trettin, 1989)A regionally extensive clastic wedge was shed southward, and probably covered much of the Canadian Shield during mid- and late Paleozoic time (Patchett et al., 2004)
A regionally extensive clastic wedge was shed southward, and probably covered much of the Canadian Shield during mid- and late Paleozoic time (Patchett et al., 2004)Detrital zircon information is available from Devonian strata belonging to this clastic wedge (McNicoll et al., 1995), from Devonian–Mississippian strata of eastern Alaska (Nation River Formation; Gehrels et al., 1999) and northwestern Canada (Beranek et al., 2010) that are known or interpreted to have been part of this clastic wedge, and from Cretaceous strata that rest on, and were at least in part recycled from, Franklinian clastic strata (Røhr et al., 2010)
Detrital zircon information is available from Devonian strata belonging to this clastic wedge (McNicoll et al., 1995), from Devonian–Mississippian strata of eastern Alaska (Nation River Formation; Gehrels et al., 1999) and northwestern Canada (Beranek et al., 2010) that are known or interpreted to have been part of this clastic wedge, and from Cretaceous strata that rest on, and were at least in part recycled from, Franklinian clastic strata (Røhr et al., 2010)As reported by previous workers, most of this detritus is interpreted to have been shed from the northern continuation of the Appalachian-Caledonian orogenic system
Evaluation of the Ouachita orogen is enabled by comparison with Pennsylvanian strata of the Jackfork Formation in the Ouachita Mountains (Arkansas) and the Haymond Formation of the(Fig
These units yield Mesoproterozoic to Paleoproterozoic ages and 350–500 Ma ages that match with the Grand Canyon strata, but they also reveal a signifi cant population of ca520 Ma grains
520 Ma ages in Mississippian Grand Canyon strata suggests that the Ouachita orogen is not a likely source terrane, although this conclusion needs to be reevaluated when additional detrital zircon data from the Ouachita system become available.Derivation from the Appalachian orogen can be evaluated by comparison with abundant detrital zircon data from Appalachian foreland basin strata reported by Gray and Zeitler (1997), McLennan et al
As shown on Figure 8D, the composite age distribution from these Devonian through Permian strata provides an excellent match for the younger than 1.4 Ga Grand Canyon agesFigure 9 provides a more detailed
Comparisons are provided for (A) Cambrian through Silurian strata (residual age peaks of 1451 and 1721 Ma), (B) Devonian strata (residual age peaks at 1433 and 1737 Ma), (C) Mississippian strata (residual age peaks at 1435, 1678, and 1740 Ma), (D) Pennsylvanian and lowest Permian strata (residual age peaks at 1539, 1657, and 1781 Ma), (E) Permian strata (residual age peaks at 426, 526, 520, 617, 1426, 1510, 1653, and 1765 Ma).analysis by sequentially comparing ages of generally coeval strata from the Grand Canyon and the Appalachian orogen
Based on this analysis, we suggest that clastic strata of the Surprise Canyon Formation consist primarily (~75 percent) of zircons derived from the Appalachian orogen, with subordinate (~25 percent) zircons derived from Precambrian basement rocksThe abundance of Mazatzal over Yavapai grains (Fig
Figure 9D provides a specifi c comparison of ages in Pennsylvanian–lowest Permian strata of the Supai Group with ages in Pennsylvanian foreland basin strata of the AppalachiansAs with the Mississippian comparison, the similarities are impressive, suggesting that the Appalachian orogen is a viable source region for much of the detritus in the Supai Group.
As with the Mississippian comparison, the similarities are impressive, suggesting that the Appalachian orogen is a viable source region for much of the detritus in the Supai Group.The difference between the Supai and Appalachian curves (Fig
The older grains (e.g., 1657 Ma and 1781 Ma) most likely record derivation from crystalline rocks exposed in the Ancestral Rocky Mountains, which were certainly high and generating sediment during Pennsylvanian–earliest Permian time (e.g., Kluth and Coney, 1981; Blakey et al., 1988; Johansen, 1988; Marzolf, 1988; Peterson, 1988; Burchfi el et al., 1992; Blakey, 2009a)It is interesting to note that the proportion of MazatzalYavapai zircons in Supai strata, 57 percent–43 percent, is similar to the underlying Surprise Canyon Formation, suggesting that the earliest Ancestral Rockies may also have been a sediment source during late Mississippian time.
It is interesting to note that the proportion of MazatzalYavapai zircons in Supai strata, 57 percent–43 percent, is similar to the underlying Surprise Canyon Formation, suggesting that the earliest Ancestral Rockies may also have been a sediment source during late Mississippian time.An additional mismatch is represented by the age peak at 1539 Ma (Fig
6) age distributions for Upper Paleozoic samplesThese ages are of uncertain origin because they do not appear in the Appalachian reference curve and do not match ages of igneous rocks on the North American craton
In terms of provenance, the detrital zircon ages in the Hermit through Kaibab Formations are a reasonably good match for Permian foreland basin strata of the Appalachian orogen, which have been reported by Becker et al(2006) (Fig
The main mismatch is in ages of 420– 720 Ma, which are present but in low abundance in the Appalachian Permian reference curve (Fig9)
First, there is the possibility that the Permian strata analyzed by Becker et al(2006), the Dunkard Group, predate the Hermit and younger strata and accordingly accumulated prior to the early Leonardian change in provenance
This possibility cannot be tested directly with the available detrital zircon data from the Ouachita orogen (only strata of Pennsylvanian age have been studied), but it is consistent with the occurrence of Neoproterozoic igneous rocks of appropriate ages in the Yucatan-Campeche blocks (as compiled by Dickinson and Gehrels, 2009a), which are thought to have been accreted during the Ouachita orogeny (Viele and Thomas, 1989; Dickinson and Lawton, 2001).1500–1540 Ma detrital zircons in some of the Permian samples (Figs
1500–1540 Ma detrital zircons in some of the Permian samples (Figs5 and 6)
One possibility is that these grains were recycled from older stratigraphic successions in western North America, e.g., Proterozoic strata of the Belt Basin of Montana, which are known to contain detrital zircons of these ages (Link et al., 2007)It is also possible that these zircons were shed from portions of the West African craton that were juxtaposed against the Appalachian margin during the Alleghanian orogeny, although such ages have not been reported from West Africa (Goodwin, 1996; S

499 Ma (late Middle Cambrian or older; Middleton et al., 2003).The Temple Butte Formation yields ages of 403 and 517 Ma, compared with a depositional age of ca
375 Ma (early Late and possibly late Middle Devonian; Beus, 2003a).The Surprise Canyon Formation has ages of 309 Ma and 416 Ma, compared with the depositional age of ca
318 Ma (late Mississippian [Chesterian]; Beus, 2003b).The Supai Group has ages of 333 Ma and 407 Ma, compared with the depositional age range of ca
275 Ma (early Pennsylvanian [Morrowan] to Early Permian [Leonardian]; Blakey, 2003).The Hermit through Kaibab Formations collectively yield youngest ages of 273–329 Ma and multigrain peak ages of 295–433 Ma (Table DR1 [see footnote 1]), compared with a depositional age of ca
268 Ma (no younger than latest Early Permian [latest Leonardian]; Hopkins and Thomson, 2003).The average time lags for the Devonian and younger samples, based on the youngest single-grain ages, range from −9 m.y
The average time lags for the Devonian and younger samples, based on the youngest single-grain ages, range from −9 m.yto 58 m.y., with an average of 25 m.y
Both of these apparent lag times suggest that Devonian through Permian sandstones of the Grand Canyon consist at least in part of detritus that records relatively rapid erosion, transport, and fi nal accumulationMost of the zircons in these samples signifi cantly predate deposition, however, which raises the possibility of recycling prior to fi nal accumulation.
A slight increase in the proportion of 1.62–1.70 Ga ages (31 percent in the Tapeats, 35 percent in the Bright Angel) may refl ect eastward migration of source regions during Cambrian transgression.These relations support the facies and paleocurrent patterns reported by McKee and Resser (1945) and summarized by Middleton et al
We accordingly envision a paleogeographic setting for Middle Cambrian time in which sediment was accumulating in a transgressional setting on a west-facing shelf, with deposition grading eastward from subtidal to intertidal to beach and eventually fl uvial environments (Fig10A).
518 Ma, and 403–426 Ma in the Middle–Upper Devonian Temple Butte FormationA reasonable source for most of this detritus is the midcontinent region, where 1.34–1.40 Ga granites and rhyolites as well as ca
These grains are subordinate, however, to 1.4– 1.5 Ga and 1.6–1.8 Ga grains that occur in relative proportions similar to the underlying Cambrian strataThe proportion of Mazatzal-Yavapai ages is also similar, with 30 percent derived from the younger (1.62–1.70 Ga) province
Accordingly, we envision a paleogeography during Middle–Late Devonian time in which rivers transported sediment from highlands along the Transcontinental Arch (in the Texas-Oklahoma–New Mexico– Colorado region) that exposed Paleoproterozoic crystalline basement, 1.34–1.48 Ga granitoids and volcanic rocks, and ca520 Ma granitoids (Fig
The third phase of sediment derivation is recorded by the Mississippian Surprise Canyon FormationThis unit yields ages older than 1.4 Ga that are generally similar to underlying units, with age peaks of 1442 Ma, 1679 Ma, and 1755 Ma

underlying strata but instead may have been shed directly from Precambrian basement of the southwestern or midcontinent United States.The main difference with older strata is the dominance of younger than 1.4 Ga ages in the Surprise Canyon Formation (Fig
10C), which contains widespread Ordovician–Devonian igneous rocks that were generated during Taconic and Acadian tectonism (Hatcher, 1989; Hatcher et al., 1989; Osberg et al., 1989; Park et al., 2010)Uplift recorded by the Surprise Canyon Formation would have occurred during onset of the Alleghanian orogeny, which affected primarily the southern Appalachians (Hatcher, 1989; Hatcher et al., 1989).
We accordingly envision a paleogeography for Mississippian time in which major river systems were carrying sediment westward across the North American continent from the Southern and possibly central Appalachians (Fig10C)
Strata of the Supai Group record a fourth phase in sediment provenance during Pennsylvanian–earliest Permian timeIn comparison with older time periods, Supai strata record derivation from the Mazatzal-Yavapai Provinces in identical relative proportions (57 percent Mazatzal and 43 percent Yavapai) but greater overall proportion than the Surprise Canyon Formation, few zircons of 1.4–1.5 Ga, and a lesser proportion of Grenville-age zircons
These rivers were also incorporating sediment (~39 percent of the total zircon grains) from Precambrian basement exposed in the Ancestral Rocky Mountains, as suggested by Peterson (1988), Blakey (1988), Blakey et al(1988), Marzolf (1988), Johansen (1988), and many others
The fi nal phase recorded in Grand Canyon stratigraphy is Early Permian (post-Wolfcampian) in age, as recorded by detrital zircon ages from the Hermit, Coconino, Toroweap, and Kaibab FormationsThese strata yield similar detrital zircon age populations that are quite distinct from underlying units
As with the Supai Group and Surprise Canyon Formation, most detritus was shed from Paleoproterozoic (mainly Mazatzal) and Grenville-age provinces (Fig10F)
The main difference with older strata is the larger proportion and greater age range of Neoproterozoic–Paleozoic zirconsThese ages are an excellent match for igneous rocks that are exposed in the southern to central Appalachian Mountains, which suggests that a major uplift/erosional event occurred in this portion of the Appalachians during Leonardian time (age of the Hermit Formation)
9E), it is also possible that much of the detritus in the Lower Permian strata was derived from Ouachita orogen.We accordingly offer a paleogeographic scenario for Permian time (Fig
We accordingly offer a paleogeographic scenario for Permian time (Fig10F) that is similar to Pennsylvanian time (Figs
10F) that is similar to Pennsylvanian time (Figs10D– 10E), with large rivers bringing detritus across the continent and northeasterly trade winds (e.g., Parrish and Peterson, 1988) reworking this material into widespread eolian units (e.g., Coconino Sandstone).
U-Pb analyses of detrital zircons from Paleozoic strata of the Grand Canyon demonstrate that the provenance of sandstones varied signifi cantly from Cambrian through Permian timeAs has been recognized by all previous workers, sandstones of the Grand Canyon were derived in large part from Precambrian basement rocks in the southwestern United States
As has been recognized by all previous workers, sandstones of the Grand Canyon were derived in large part from Precambrian basement rocks in the southwestern United StatesIn lower strata, as described by McKee and Resser (1945), nearly all of the sediment appears to have been shed from basement rocks exposed in the Grand Canyon area and in cratonal rocks to the east
(1988), Marzolf (1988), Johansen (1988), and many others, an abundance of sand was derived from Precambrian basement exposed in the Ancestral Rocky Mountains to the east.Our detrital zircon data also demonstrate that much of the sandstone in the upper part of the Grand Canyon section was shed from distant sources, including mid-Proterozoic rocks of the Grenville orogen and Neoproterozoic–Paleozoic rocks in circum–North American orogenic belts
Our detrital zircon data also demonstrate that much of the sandstone in the upper part of the Grand Canyon section was shed from distant sources, including mid-Proterozoic rocks of the Grenville orogen and Neoproterozoic–Paleozoic rocks in circum–North American orogenic beltsThis result was fi rst presented by Dickinson and Gehrels (2003) based on analysis of one sample of Coconino Sandstone, with the conclusion that much of the detritus was derived from the Appalachian orogen
Our more comprehensive data set presented here indicates that all of the sandstones above the Mississippian Redwall Limestone probably originated in large part from the Appalachian orogen.The conclusion that sediment was transported from the Appalachian orogen to the Grand Canyon region from Mississippian through Permian time has important implications for the paleogeography of North America during late Paleozoic time
The conclusion that sediment was transported from the Appalachian orogen to the Grand Canyon region from Mississippian through Permian time has important implications for the paleogeography of North America during late Paleozoic timeThe Appalachian region was the continental divide during much of late Paleozoic time and spawned major rivers that fl owed westward
The Appalachian region was the continental divide during much of late Paleozoic time and spawned major rivers that fl owed westwardThe northern Appalachian and Caledonian mountains may have fed rivers that drained across central Canada into the west coast of North America (Figs
Throughout Paleozoic time, at least until the middle Pennsylvanian, the Transcontinental Arch prevented direct fl owage of southern Appalachian–derived rivers into the Western Interior (Figs10A–10D; see also Blakey, 2009a)
The late Paleozoic Ancestral Rocky Mountains would have further complicated the courses of transcontinental river systems (Figs10E and 10F)
During Paleozoic marine highstands, southern Appalachian rivers would have drained into midcontinent sedimentary basins and would not have reached the Western Interior (Figs10B–10F)
However, during the late Pennsylvanian and Permian, southern Appalachian rivers may have fl owed directly into the northern Western Interior during marine lowstandsOn Figures 10E and 10F, the areas across the midcontinent shown as epicontinental seas were likely exposed during lowstands from southern Canada to central Texas; this condition would have permitted direct fl uvial or eolian transport from the southern Appalachians into the Dakotas, Wyoming, and possibly Montana.
These complications in Paleozoic paleogeography suggest that few, if any, Appalachian rivers directly reached the Grand Canyon region, and that wind systems may have played a signifi cant roleDuring the middle and late Paleozoic, northeasterly trade winds (northerly in present coordinate systems) likely defl ated Appalachian river systems that reached the northern United States and southern and central Canada, as described previously, and transported sand and loess southward
During the middle and late Paleozoic, northeasterly trade winds (northerly in present coordinate systems) likely defl ated Appalachian river systems that reached the northern United States and southern and central Canada, as described previously, and transported sand and loess southwardThe trail of late Paleozoic eolian sandstones ranges from Lower Pennsylvanian (Atokan) in the Grand Canyon (Manacacha Formation) through Middle and Upper Pennsylvanian across much of the Western Interior (Hermosa, Weber, Casper, Wescogame, etc., Formations), through Permian (Weber, Cedar Mesa, Esplanade, etc., Formations)
The trail of late Paleozoic eolian sandstones ranges from Lower Pennsylvanian (Atokan) in the Grand Canyon (Manacacha Formation) through Middle and Upper Pennsylvanian across much of the Western Interior (Hermosa, Weber, Casper, Wescogame, etc., Formations), through Permian (Weber, Cedar Mesa, Esplanade, etc., Formations)Consistent northeasterly winds transported sand southwestward throughout the late Paleozoic (Peterson, 1988).
Consistent northeasterly winds transported sand southwestward throughout the late Paleozoic (Peterson, 1988).Given that Grand Canyon strata contain abundant detrital zircons that are interpreted to have been shed from the southern and central Appalachian orogen, it is tempting to interpret the age distributions of these units as a possible record of magmatism in the Appalachian orogen
