Jurassic arc volcanism and transition to crustal extension1Facultad de Ciencias de la Tierra, Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, 64700 Linares, Nuevo León, México
U-Pb detrital-zircon ages (n = 576) from six Huizachal Group sandstones (fi ve from La Boca and one from La Joya) consist of four groups indicating a mixed provenance: (1) Grenville grains (~1.3–1.0 Ga) derived from Gondwana (Novillo Gneiss); (2) earlymiddle Paleozoic grains (430–300 Ma) derived from peri-Gondwanan accreted rocks (Granjeno Schist); (3) Permo-Triassic grains (296–222 Ma) derived from volcanic and plutonic rocks (West Pangaean arc) and/or turbidites (Guacamaya Formation); and (4) Early-Middle Jurassic grains (199– 164 Ma), locally derived from the Nazas arcGroups 1–3 increase in abundance upsection as a result of unroofi ng of Jurassic volcanic and sedimentary carapace from uplifted basement.
Groups 1–3 increase in abundance upsection as a result of unroofi ng of Jurassic volcanic and sedimentary carapace from uplifted basement.The Huizachal Group records three stages in the pre-breakup history of Gondwana: (1) The lower member of La Boca Formation (maximum depositional age 184–183 Ma;
Pleinsbachian) indicates Nazas arc activity; (2) the upper member (maximum depositional age 167–163 Ma; Bathonian–Callovian) indicates continued arc magmatism as early*Emails: Rubio-Cisneros: igor_rubio@yahoo.com; Lawton: tlawton@nmsu.edu.
Although our La Joya sample lacks a coherent age group of young grains, its single youngest grain age (164 ± 3 Ma; Callovian) is consistent with its stratigraphic position beneath inferred Oxfordian strata.Depósitos continentales y rocas volcánicas del Grupo Huizachal en el Valle de Huizachal registran magmatismo de arco y subsecuente extensión cortical previa a la generación de piso oceánico en el Golfo de México
El Grupo Huizachal registra tres etapas en la historia previa al rompimiento de Gondwana: (1) El miembro inferior de la Formación La Boca (edad máxima de depósito 184–183 Ma, Pleinsbachiano) indica la actividad del arco de Nazas; (2) el miembro superior (edad máxima de depósito 168–163 Ma; Bathoniano–Calloviano) indica el continuo magmatismo de arco mientras la temprana extensión cortical formaba horsts que aportaron granos a una cuenca de rift incipiente; y (3) la Formación la Joya representa el desarrollo tardío de la cuenca de rift y la extensa exposición de fl ancos de rocas de basamentoA pesar de que nuestra muestra de La Joya carezca de un grupo de edades coherentes de granos jóvenes, la edad de su único grano mas joven (164 ± 3 Ma; Calloviano) es consistente con la posición estratigráfi ca por debajo de depósitos inferidos del Oxfordiano.
A pesar de que nuestra muestra de La Joya carezca de un grupo de edades coherentes de granos jóvenes, la edad de su único grano mas joven (164 ± 3 Ma; Calloviano) es consistente con la posición estratigráfi ca por debajo de depósitos inferidos del Oxfordiano.In this study, we investigate the detrital zircon age populations of continental Mesozoic strata in the Valle de Huizachal, located ~15 km southwest of Ciudad Victoria in the northeastern Mexican state of Tamaulipas (Fig
In this study, we investigate the detrital zircon age populations of continental Mesozoic strata in the Valle de Huizachal, located ~15 km southwest of Ciudad Victoria in the northeastern Mexican state of Tamaulipas (Fig1) in order to determine sandstone provenance and place age constraints on the stratigraphic succession
This succession contains an important Jurassic vertebrate fossil assemblage (Clarket al., 1991, 1994; Fastovsky et al., 1995, 2005), but the age range of the strata has continued to be
Our U-Pb detrital zircon analysis contributes critical information on preLate Jurassic strata of the Huizachal Group and indicates that the La Boca Formation, consisting of an older succession of volcanic and epiclastic rocks and a younger succession of dominantly epiclastic strata (Fastovsky et al., 1995, 2005), is entirely of Early to Middle Jurassic ageThe detrital zircon data also indicate a striking upsection change in provenance as volcanic and sedimentary rocks were increasingly eroded and dissected on blocks uplifted during crustal extension.
Proterozoic metamorphic and igneous rocks and Paleozoic strata of the Oaxaquia terrane (Ortega-Gutierrez et al., 1995; Keppie et al.,2004) are widely exposed in the HuizachalPeregrina anticlinorium
In structural juxtaposition with the gneiss is the Silurian to Carboniferous Granjeno Schist, which consists of polydeformed, low-grade pelitic metasedimentary and metavolcaniclastic rocks that enclose lenses of serpentinite metagabbro (~430– 300 Ma; Dowe et al., 2005; Nance et al., 2007)An unmetamorphosed succession of Paleozoic marine clastic strata nonconformably overlies the Novillo Gneiss
An unmetamorphosed succession of Paleozoic marine clastic strata nonconformably overlies the Novillo GneissThe base of the Paleozoic succession consists of Middle Silurian clastic shallow-marine strata with a Gondwanan fauna (Stewart et al., 1999)
The base of the Paleozoic succession consists of Middle Silurian clastic shallow-marine strata with a Gondwanan fauna (Stewart et al., 1999)This succession is unconformably overlain by Lower Mississippian sandstone and shale containing a shallow-marine fauna of Laurentian affi nity (Stewart et al., 1999)
This succession is unconformably overlain by Lower Mississippian sandstone and shale containing a shallow-marine fauna of Laurentian affi nity (Stewart et al., 1999)These rocks are depositionally overlain by a fl ow-banded rhyolite dated at 334 ± 34 Ma (lower intercept U-Pb zircon age; Stewart et al., 1999), which is in turn unconformably overlain by Permo-Carboniferous turbidites and volcaniclastic fl ysch (Gursky and Michalzik, 1989)
These rocks are depositionally overlain by a fl ow-banded rhyolite dated at 334 ± 34 Ma (lower intercept U-Pb zircon age; Stewart et al., 1999), which is in turn unconformably overlain by Permo-Carboniferous turbidites and volcaniclastic fl ysch (Gursky and Michalzik, 1989)All Proterozoic and Paleozoic rocks contain NNWtrending folds and associated northeast-vergent thrusts and dextral transcurrent faults (CarrilloBravo, 1961; Gursky, 1996; Stewart et al., 1999; Dowe et al., 2005).
All Proterozoic and Paleozoic rocks contain NNWtrending folds and associated northeast-vergent thrusts and dextral transcurrent faults (CarrilloBravo, 1961; Gursky, 1996; Stewart et al., 1999; Dowe et al., 2005).A belt of Permo-Triassic dioritic and granodioritic intrusive rocks cuts all older units along a northwest-southeast trend extending from the Sierra Madre Oriental, through the Coahuila block, and into the North American craton in the northwest
A belt of Permo-Triassic dioritic and granodioritic intrusive rocks cuts all older units along a northwest-southeast trend extending from the Sierra Madre Oriental, through the Coahuila block, and into the North American craton in the northwestGeochemical and isotopic analyses indicate a continental arc origin for the intrusive rocks, which range in age from 287 to 232 Ma (Bartolini et al., 1999; Torres et al., 1999; Dowe

The La Joya pinches out onto basement highs and is overlain by Oxfordian evaporite strata (Salvador, 1987)The uppermost La Joya Formation marks the onset of prolonged Late Jurassic marine transgression (Rueda-Gaxiola et al., 1991; Goldhammer, 1999).
The uppermost La Joya Formation marks the onset of prolonged Late Jurassic marine transgression (Rueda-Gaxiola et al., 1991; Goldhammer, 1999).In this paper, we designate the lower and middle intervals as informal lower and upper members of the La Boca Formation
The Huizachal Formation was considered Upper Jurassic by Imlay et al(1948) on the basis of comparison with a red bed–evaporite succession of that age in southern Mexico
It was nevertheless considered Lower-Middle Jurassic by Humphrey and Diaz (1956) on the basis of its stratigraphic position beneath inferred Upper Jurassic carbonate and evaporite strataUpon subsequent division of the Huizachal Group into the La Boca and overlying La Joya formations, the La Boca Formation was considered Late Triassic–Early Jurassic on the basis of plant fossils (Mixon et al., 1959; Mixon, 1963a, 1963b)
Upon subsequent division of the Huizachal Group into the La Boca and overlying La Joya formations, the La Boca Formation was considered Late Triassic–Early Jurassic on the basis of plant fossils (Mixon et al., 1959; Mixon, 1963a, 1963b)Vertebrate fossils near the base of the La Boca Formation suggested a Middle Jurassic age (Clark and Hopson, 1985; Fastovsky et al., 1995)
Vertebrate fossils near the base of the La Boca Formation suggested a Middle Jurassic age (Clark and Hopson, 1985; Fastovsky et al., 1995)An inferred tuff at the base of the upper member of the La Boca Formation, unconformably overlying the lower La Boca member or VES, yielded a U-Pb zircon age of 189.0 ± 0.2 Ma (early Pleinsbachian; time scale of Walker and Geissman, 2009) on the basis of a concordia intercept age calculated from eleven age groups, each consisting of 8–20 zircon grains, which range from 194 to 186 Ma (Fastovsky et al., 2005)
Accordingly, the age of the VES was interpreted as older than 189 Ma, and possibly an exposure of upper Paleozoic volcanic rocks (Fastovsky et al., 2005)The
lower interval was similarly interpreted as part of an unnamed Permo-Triassic volcanic succession (Bartolini et al., 1999)Recent discovery of more extensive exposures of the lower La Boca unit (García-Obregón, 2007; Rubio-Cisneros et al., 2010) permitted a widespread sampling of sandstone beds for detrital zircon geochronology presented here.
Four distinct detrital zircon age populations are recognized in the sample set: (1) Grenville grains (~1.3– 1.0 Ga); (2) early Paleozoic grains (430–300 Ma); (3) Permo-Triassic grains (296–222 Ma); and (4) Early-Middle Jurassic grains (199–164 Ma)The characteristics of the individual detrital zircon samples are described here in stratigraphic order from base to top
This maximum depositional age is indistinguishable from that of VH31-03 and indicates a likely Early Jurassic (Pleinsbachian) age for the lower memberThe two lower La Boca samples are dominated by Jurassic grains (201–164 Ma; 53 percent), fewer Grenville grains (1.3–1.1 Ga; 21 percent), and subordinate Early Paleozoic ( Cambrian–Devonian ; 10 percent) and Permo-Triassic grains (292–243 Ma; 7 percent)
The two lower La Boca samples are dominated by Jurassic grains (201–164 Ma; 53 percent), fewer Grenville grains (1.3–1.1 Ga; 21 percent), and subordinate Early Paleozoic ( Cambrian–Devonian ; 10 percent) and Permo-Triassic grains (292–243 Ma; 7 percent)Neoproterozoic grains (900–550 Ma) are uncommon (2 percent).
Neoproterozoic grains (900–550 Ma) are uncommon (2 percent).The three upper La Boca samples (VH31-06, -08, and -09) have similar age spectra, but their spectra are different from the lower La Boca samples
The maximum depositional age for the upper member is thus Middle Jurassic (Bathonian–early Callovian)The upper La Boca samples are dominated by Grenville grains (44 percent), followed in decreasing abundance by Permo-Triassic grains (296–234 Ma; 13 percent), Jurassic grains (196– 166 Ma; 11 percent), and subordinate Early Paleozoic grains (7 percent)
The upper La Boca samples are dominated by Grenville grains (44 percent), followed in decreasing abundance by Permo-Triassic grains (296–234 Ma; 13 percent), Jurassic grains (196– 166 Ma; 11 percent), and subordinate Early Paleozoic grains (7 percent)Neoproterozoic grains are more abundant (8 percent) than in the lower La Boca.
Neoproterozoic grains are more abundant (8 percent) than in the lower La Boca.Sample VH31-10 from the base of the La Joya Formation contains an age spectrum similar to that of the upper La Boca samples
The La Joya sample is dominated by Grenville grains (36 percent), followed in abundance by early Paleozoic grains (17 percent), Permo-Triassic grains (292–222 Ma; 16 percent), and uncommon Jurassic grains (188–164 Ma; 4 percent)Neoproterozoic grains (8 percent) are similar in abundance to the upper La Boca samples.
Neoproterozoic grains (8 percent) are similar in abundance to the upper La Boca samples.The detrital zircon grain age groups of the Huizachal Group sandstones can be attributed to four different suites of source rocks exposed locally in eastern Mexico
Permian–Triassic granitoids (287– 232 Ma; Torres et al., 1999; Dowe et al., 2005) that intrude older basement in the Sierra Madre Oriental closely match the range of ages (296 to 222 Ma) in the Permo-Triassic detrital zircon age groupGrains of this age might also have been derived from the Permo-Triassic Guacamaya Formation, which is also exposed in the Huizachal anticlinorium
Grains of this age might also have been derived from the Permo-Triassic Guacamaya Formation, which is also exposed in the Huizachal anticlinoriumEarly to Middle Jurassic grains (199–164 Ma) appear to have been derived from the Nazas volcanic arc.
Early to Middle Jurassic grains (199–164 Ma) appear to have been derived from the Nazas volcanic arc.Figure 6
Jurassic grains decrease from 53 percent to 4 percent from the base to the top of the Huizachal Group, whereas other grain age groups, specifi cally Grenville, Neoproterozoic, early Paleozoic, and Permo-Triassic groups, increase in abundance from 38 percent for the sample at the base to 77 percent– 79 percent in the samples at the top of the studied successionThe signifi cant decrease in Jurassic grains and enrichment in basement grains suggest a progressive erosional unroofi ng of uplifted blocks in the source area for the detrital zircons
The signifi cant decrease in Jurassic grains and enrichment in basement grains suggest a progressive erosional unroofi ng of uplifted blocks in the source area for the detrital zirconsIn addition, the detrital zircon ages of the Huizachal Group in Valle de Huizachal demonstrate that local source rocks could have provided the observed detritus to the La Boca and La Joya formations, an observation consistent with deposition in a rift basin formed during the breakup of Pangaea.
Lower La Boca samples have Early Jurassic (ca184–183 Ma) maximum depositional ages, and upper La Boca samples have Middle Jurassic (ca
184–183 Ma) maximum depositional ages, and upper La Boca samples have Middle Jurassic (ca167–163 Ma) ages
The La Joya sample has a single late Middle Jurassic grain (164 Ma), which is not statistically different from the young grain ages in the upper member of the La Boca FormationThe progressive decrease in maximum depositional age, common interbedded volcanic and pyroclastic rocks, and stratigraphic position beneath Middle-Upper Jurassic evaporate strata suggest that the EarlyMiddle Jurassic maximum depositional ages of the La Boca Formation approximate the true depositional age of these red beds
The progressive decrease in maximum depositional age, common interbedded volcanic and pyroclastic rocks, and stratigraphic position beneath Middle-Upper Jurassic evaporate strata suggest that the EarlyMiddle Jurassic maximum depositional ages of the La Boca Formation approximate the true depositional age of these red bedsOn the basis of the systematic stratigraphic decrease in maximum depositional ages, we also infer that magmatism in the age range 184 to 163 Ma was coeval with deposition of the Huizachal Group.
Detrital zircon ages in the lower member of the La Boca Formation in Valle de Huizachal corroborate previous inferences of an Early to Middle Jurassic age for the La Boca Formation (Clark et al., 1994; Fastovsky et al., 1995, 2005; Stewart et al., 1999; Barboza-Gudiño et al., 2008)Our data further indicates that the upper member of the La Boca Formation is at least in part Middle Jurassic, consistent with inferences drawn from vertebrate fossils recovered near the base of the member (Clark et al., 1994; Fastovsky et al., 1995), and that the La Joya Formation was deposited near the end of the Middle Jurassic and is probably Callovian.
Our data further indicates that the upper member of the La Boca Formation is at least in part Middle Jurassic, consistent with inferences drawn from vertebrate fossils recovered near the base of the member (Clark et al., 1994; Fastovsky et al., 1995), and that the La Joya Formation was deposited near the end of the Middle Jurassic and is probably Callovian.The Early-Middle Jurassic age for the two members of the La Boca Formation indicates equivalence with Lower-Middle Jurassic volcanic successions elsewhere in NE Mexico (Barboza-Gudiño et al., 2008)
The Early-Middle Jurassic age for the two members of the La Boca Formation indicates equivalence with Lower-Middle Jurassic volcanic successions elsewhere in NE Mexico (Barboza-Gudiño et al., 2008)Volcanism recorded by volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of the Huizachal anticlinorium was likely related to arc magmatism of the correlative Nazas Formation near Torreón, Coahuila (Imlay et al., 1948; Belcher, 1979; Salvador, 1987; BarbozaGudiño et al., 2008; Rubio-Cisneros et al., 2010), as implied by the existence of roughly coeval Late Triassic–Early to Middle Jurassic magmatic pulses (Bartolini et al., 2003) in northeastern Mexico, and volcanic rocks with a geochemical signature compatible with an arc origin (Fastovsky et al., 2005; García-Obregón, 2007; Barboza-Gudiño et al., 2008)
Volcanism recorded by volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks of the Huizachal anticlinorium was likely related to arc magmatism of the correlative Nazas Formation near Torreón, Coahuila (Imlay et al., 1948; Belcher, 1979; Salvador, 1987; BarbozaGudiño et al., 2008; Rubio-Cisneros et al., 2010), as implied by the existence of roughly coeval Late Triassic–Early to Middle Jurassic magmatic pulses (Bartolini et al., 2003) in northeastern Mexico, and volcanic rocks with a geochemical signature compatible with an arc origin (Fastovsky et al., 2005; García-Obregón, 2007; Barboza-Gudiño et al., 2008)Therefore, we infer that La Boca deposition took place in the Early Jurassic Nazas volcanic arc, consistent with relative age inferences made by RubioCisneros et al
Therefore, we infer that La Boca deposition took place in the Early Jurassic Nazas volcanic arc, consistent with relative age inferences made by RubioCisneros et al(2010).
Basement was not extensively exposed during the Early Jurassic, when it was evidently buried by Jurassic volcanic rocksSubsequent basement uplift and erosion in Middle Jurassic time likely created an angular unconformity of 10°–20° beneath the upper member of the La Boca Formation
Subsequent basement uplift and erosion in Middle Jurassic time likely created an angular unconformity of 10°–20° beneath the upper member of the La Boca FormationAdjacent to intrusive rhyolite bodies, this discordance is greater as a result of local folding and tilting of the intruded strata
An upward increase in zircon grains from PermoTriassic granitoids, Paleozoic Granjeno Schist, and Grenville Novillo complex refl ect the progressive unroofi ng of the basement complexesFinally, the La Joya Formation accumulated during a concluding extensional episode, evidenced by recycling of underlying red bed and volcanic strata as clasts in the La Joya Formation (RubioCisneros and Ocampo-Díaz, 2010), extensive exposure of nearby basement rocks indicated by the detrital zircons, and the angular unconformity beneath the La Joya Formation
The exposures at Valle de Huizachal lie on the eastern edge of a band of Jurassic volcanic exposures with an east-west extent of ~170 km (BarbozaGudiño et al., 2008) and may represent the east fl ank of the Nazas arc, where crustal extension juxtaposed thin arc volcanics and uplifted basement blocksArc rocks of the same age in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico have been interpreted as the record of a generally extensional arc system (Busby-Spera, 1988) that continued into what is now eastern and southern Mexico (Grajales-Nishimura et al., 1992; Dickinson and Lawton, 2001).
The new depositional ages and the age range of Jurassic zircon grains in the red beds at Valle de Huizachal suggest that magmatism in the Nazas volcanic arc of northeastern Mexico ceased prior to opening of the Gulf of MexicoJurassic grains with concordant ages range
Jurassic grains with concordant ages range199 to 164 Ma (n = 115 grains; Supplemental Table 1 [see footnote 1]); four younger grains ranging from 162 to 153 Ma have analytical errors of 5 Ma or are discordant
The data thus indicate that no zircon-yielding volcanic rocks younger than Callovian age provided detritus to the Huizachal GroupMoreover, the youngest grains in the data set are present in the upper member of the La Boca Formation, ending the trend of younger grain ages in higher stratigraphic levels and suggesting that magmatism had ceased prior to deposition of the La Joya Formation
Although the age of seafl oor spreading in the Gulf of Mexico is not well constrained, it is generally estimated to have begun in the late Oxfordian (~158–157 Ma; Pindell, 1985; Pindell and Kennan, 2007)The existing data thus suggest that Nazas magmatism shut down immediately before the onset of seafl oor spreading in the Gulf of Mexico.
Detrital zircon young grain ages indicate that the lower member is Early Jurassic (maximum depositional age 184–183 Ma, Pleinsbachian) and the upper member is Middle Jurassic (maximum depositional age 167–163 Ma, Bathonian–Early Callovian)Continuing detrital input from local volcanic sources indicates that maximum depositional ages are a good approximation of true depositional ages
Detrital zircon ages are inconclusive as to the depositional age of the La Joya Formation, but its position between B athonian– Callovian red beds and overlying Oxfordian strata is consistent with a Callovian age.These red bed deposits were derived from P recambrian–Mesozoic rocks exposed nearby in the Huizachal-Peregrina anticlinorium
These red bed deposits were derived from P recambrian–Mesozoic rocks exposed nearby in the Huizachal-Peregrina anticlinoriumFour detrital zircon age populations in the Huizachal Group include: (1) Grenville grains (~1.3– 1.0 Ga) derived from Gondwanan basement known locally as the Novillo Gneiss complex; (2) early Paleozoic grains (430–300 Ma) derived from peri-Gondwanan accreted rocks represented locally by the Granjeno Schist; (3) Permo-Triassic grains (296–222 Ma) derived from volcanic and plutonic rocks of the West Pangaean (East Mexican) arc; and (4) EarlyMiddle Jurassic grains (199–164 Ma) derived from the Nazas volcanic arc.

Continued extension and widespread exposure of basement rocks took place prior to and during deposition of the basal alluvial-fan conglomerate of the La Joya Formation, whose young grain ages are generally older than the inferred late Middle Jurassic depositional age of the strataThe absence of younger grains in the La Joya Formation suggests that Nazas arc magmatism ceased by Callovian time (~166–164 Ma).
The absence of younger grains in the La Joya Formation suggests that Nazas arc magmatism ceased by Callovian time (~166–164 Ma).Cabello, Raul García-Obregón, Kate Giles, Gary Hunt, Uwe Jenchen, Diana Lawton, Dirk Masuch Oestereich , Yamzul Ocampo-Díaz, Juan Alonso Ramírez Fernández, Hector de León, and Victor Valencia for discussions and assistance
