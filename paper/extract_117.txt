Moreover, our Hf isotopic compositions indicate two significant continental growth events in the Tonian and early Paleozoic, respectively.The longest-lived subduction-accretionary process from the late Neoproterozoic to late Paleozoic caused the Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB; Jahn et al., 2000) to be one of the largest orogenic systems bounded by the Siberia and Baltica cratons in the north and the Tarim and North China cratons in the south (Fig

The one-way subduction process affiliated different types of tectonic terranes to the whole orogen system, including accretionary wedges, oceanic arcs, oceanic islands, and Precambrian microcontinents (e.g., Şengör et al., 1993; Jahn et al., 2000; Buslov et al., 2001; Badarch et al., 2002; Windley et al., 2007; Xiao et al., 2010;  Safonova and Santosh, 2014; Safonova and Santosh, 2014; Safonova et al., 2017)The whole-rock Sm-Nd isotopic composition and varied Hf-in-zircon values of felsic plutons in the CAOB indicate the addition of juvenile materials during the Paleozoic, although the volume of continental growth is still controversial (Kovalenko et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2017; Kröner et al., 2014, 2017).

It was originally considered as a Precambrian microcontinent based on some old whole-rock Sr-Nd isotopic data of supracrustal rocks exposed in the Russian and Chinese Altai (e.g., Mossakovsky et al., 1994; Hu et al., 2000)This suggestion seemed to be supported by some newly obtained Precambrian whole-rock Nd model ages for paragneisses and granitic rocks and U-Pb ages of inherited zircons from magmatic rocks in the Chinese Altai, although the buried Precambrian basement was not yet discovered (e.g., Wang et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2011; Dong et al., 2018)

The AMT used to be interpreted as a remnant of oceanic island arcs that have late Neoproterozoic–early Paleozoic age (Buslov et al., 2004; Cai et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2015, 2018) or a giant accretionary wedge of the Lake Zone of Ikh-Mongol arc system (Xiao et al., 2009; Soejono et al., 2017; Janoušek et al., 2018)Numerous arc-type magmatism occurred in the Lake Zone during the Late Cambrian–Early Ordovician (e.g., Kröner et al., 2010; Buriánek et al., 2017; Janoušek et al., 2018), and then was followed by abundant Silurian-Devonian granitoids in the Chinese Altai terrane (e.g., Yuan et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2008; Cai et al., 2011).

Therefore, we proposed that the time of deposition of the Mongol Altai series should span from the early Silurian to the late Devonian, which is consistent with the Habahe group in the western Chinese Altai (Long et al., 2007, 2010, 2012; Dong et al., 2018).Although the depositional time of our samples experienced a long geological history during the middle Paleozoic, all samples display a uniform age spectrum that consists of a highest early Paleozoic age peak at Cambrian, subdominant peak at Tonian, and rare peaks with older ages

Although the depositional time of our samples experienced a long geological history during the middle Paleozoic, all samples display a uniform age spectrum that consists of a highest early Paleozoic age peak at Cambrian, subdominant peak at Tonian, and rare peaks with older agesSuch similar patterns demonstrate that these samples share analogous clastic sources, and the tectonic setting of Mongolian Altai during the middle Paleozoic had not changed remarkably.

Such similar patterns demonstrate that these samples share analogous clastic sources, and the tectonic setting of Mongolian Altai during the middle Paleozoic had not changed remarkably.Three parameters—CIA, ICV and PIA—are widely used to define the weathering characteristics and determine the source compositions of sedimentary rocks (e.g., Fedo et al., 1995; Cullers and Podkovyrov, 2000)

Therefore, we propose that the sediments in the Mongolian Altai were more likely derived from a continental island arc or active continental margins than a craton interior or recycled orogen in the early Paleozoic (Bhatia, 1983)Additionally, Floyd and Leveridge (1987) established a tectonic setting discrimination diagram by using Hf and La/Th ratios

Such subduction within the Paleo-Asian Ocean in the late Cambrian not only significantly reworked the continental sliver, but also leaded considerable formation of juvenile crustal materialThe Altai-Mongolian terrane, as a fore-arc basin or accretionary wedge, simultaneously received the sediments not only from a newly formed arc complex, but also from the Neoproterozoic felsic rocks and basement materials of the TuvaMongol microcontinent.
