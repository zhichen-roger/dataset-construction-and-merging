9B) provided an isopach map of the Lower Cretaceous Cedar Mountain Formation, a reading of which suggests that the forebulge lay beneath eastern Utah at that timeFor part of Jurassic–Cretaceous time DeCelles and Currie (1996) argued that the foreland basin and its forebulge were migrating eastward at a rate of about 0.5 cm/ yr, but there is no conclusive proof that this rate persisted throughout the Cretaceous, and even if it did, this would still leave eastern Utah on the inner flank of the forebulge, so the forebulge model for Castlegate sedimentation is not ruled out.

Along the western margins of the Western Interior Seaway a series of major thrust plates stepped progressively farther eastward into the basin between the Early Cretaceous and the Early Cenozoic, and a succession of unconformity-bounded nonmarine sequences developed in response to the episodic loading and unloading of the basement (DeCelles et al1995; Schwans 1995)
