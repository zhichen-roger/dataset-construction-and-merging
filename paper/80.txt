Earlier interpretations associated the deposit with the Neoproterozoic ‘snowball Earth’ hypothesisThe data allow direct correlation, for the first time, between Early Palaeozoic deposits in both South America and South Africa connecting the glacial deposits from southern Bolivia to central Argentina with those in South Africa (Pakhuis Formation)
On the basis of these results, a new distribution map of glacial cover, corresponding to the Hirnantian stage, can be developed.Supplementary material: Sampling and analytical techniques, data, a simplified map and BSE images are
2006) have been used to invoke an association with Neoproterozoic glacial events of possible global extent (In˜iguez Rodr´ıguez 1999; Pazos et al2008)
Subsequently, the depositional age is of utmost importance for South American and South African geology and of wide international interest as it can no longer be related to the Neoproterozoic and therefore not to the ‘snowball Earth’ hypothesis.The Sierra del Volca´n glacial diamictite is exposed in the Tandilia System, a NW–SE-striking mountain belt located 300 km south of Buenos Aires (Fig
2007) and covered by Neoproterozoic rocks of the Sierras Bayas Group, overlain by the Neoproterozoic to Early Palaeozoic(?) Cerro Negro or Punta Mogotes Formation (Fig1b; Dalla Salda et al
Although the Sierra del Volca´n diamictite has been widely regarded as part of the Neoproterozoic (In˜iguez Rodr´ıguez 1999; Pazos et al2008), its stratigraphic position and age have remained uncertain, as it overlies the Palaeoproterozoic basement with an erosional unconformity and is, in turn, unconformably covered by siliciclastic rocks of the Ordovician to Silurian Balcarce Formation (Seilacher et al

The glacial diamictite and Neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks are only slightly folded and not metamorphosed, but have been affected by diagenetic events (Van Staden et al2005; Go´mez Peral et al
Base metal concentrations, Th/U ratios and REE anomalies do not reflect anoxic depositional conditions, although a strong increase in Mo concentrations towards the top of the diamictite is notworthy, and is similar to the data from a Hirnantian glacial deposit in South Africa (Pakhuis Formation; Young et al2000).

Because no Archaean or older Palaeoproterozoic zircon input was identified in the zircon population, it is likely that the main sources are located in the central part of the R´ıo de la Plata craton, which would also include source rocks of Mesoproterozoic agesIt is possible that the latter may also have been situated in South Africa when interpreted with regard to palaeocurrent and provenance studies (Poire´ et al
The age of the youngest detrital zircon dated in the Sierra del Volca´n diamictite unit sets a lower age limit for sedimentation in the Ordovician.The new stratigraphic position for the Sierra del Volca´n glacial diamictite can therefore be interpreted as age-equivalent to those in Argentina and southern South America (D´ıaz Martinez & Grahn 2007) and to the Pakhuis Formation in South Africa, where the same glacial event is recorded for Gondwana (compiled by Young et al
For comparison, the major peaks of the zircon distribution of the Neoproterozoic Villa Mo´nica Formation (‘Neoproterozoic Tandil’; Rapela et al2007; Gaucher et al
2008) and from the Ordovician to Silurian Balcarce Formation (‘Ordovician Tandil’; Rapela et al2007) are shown.
The age constraints allow the Sierra del Volca´n glacial diamictite to be assigned a late Ordovician ageThe Ordovician sedimentary record in Argentina is exceptionally well studied, resulting in established palaeoclimatic models, whereas the only glacial environments reported are Hirnantian in age (a compilation of the vast literature has been provided by Acen˜olaza (2002) and references therein)

The Late Ordovician Sierra del Volca´n glacial diamictite is redefined as a member of the Ordovician to Silurian Balcarce Formation and can be interpreted as age-equivalent to the Pakhuis Formation (Table Mountain Group) in South AfricaThe recognition of a glacial deposit of Late Ordovician age in eastern Argentina suggests that the Hirnantian ice sheet cover extended from SW South Africa to eastern Argentina, stretching to the central Parana´ Basin and into central and NW Argentina and southern Bolivia (Fig
