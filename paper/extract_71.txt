In contrast, the scarcity of diagenetic pyrite in marine-dominated environments of the lower Hospital Hill Subgroup (of which some are carbonaceous) and distal portions of the Government and Jeppestown Subgroups, is consistent with a lack of sulfate in the Archean ocean.The Witwatersrand Supergroup not only represents one of Earth’s oldest and well preserved Archean supracrustal successions but also hosts the world’s prime example of ancient placer conglomerate-hosted Au-U deposits (Becker, 1896; Mellor, 1916; Ramdohr, 1958; Pretorius, 1974; Minter, 1978; Frimmel et al., 2005)

The Mesoarchean Witwatersrand Supergroup is preserved over the central portions of the Archean Kaapvaal craton in South Africa (Figure 1A)It is a structural and erosional remnant (Figure 1B) of what was once a much larger sedimentary basin, perhaps an area in excess of 320,000 km2, including the Mozaan Group of the Pongola Supergroup (Figure 1A) (Beukes and Cairncross, 1991; Nhleko, 2003)

These include pre-Ventersdorp compressive deformation and alteration, lithospheric extension and high heat flow during the deposition of the Neoarchean Ventersdorp Supergroup (2714 ± 8 Ma, Armstrong et al., 1991), thrusting prior to the deposition of the Transvaal Supergroup (Roering, 1990), burial metamorphism of the Transvaal Supergroup (Frimmel and Minter, 2002; Meier et al., 2009), metamorphism related to the intrusion of the Bushveld Complex (2054 ± 1 Ma, Scoates and Friedman, 2008; Gibson and Jones, 2002; Kositcin and Krapez, 2004; Rasmussen et al., 2007) and deformation related to the Vredefort impact event (2023 ± 4 Ma, Kamo et al., 1996)Higher grades of metamorphism are evident in certain parts of the basin, particularly around the collar of Vredefort Dome (Gibson and Wallmach, 1995; Frimmel, 1997b) and towards the northwest corner of the basin (Law and Phillips, 2005)

Disseminated pyrite is recorded from shale clasts in conglomerates from the Pongola Supergroup (Saager et al., 1986), but also from other Neoarchean and Proterozoic sedimentary rock successions (Partridge et al., 2008; Ono et al., 2009).Disseminated crystal aggregates of pyrite occur exclusively in ~1 cm thick carbonaceous beds in the Promise Formation, BAB1 drill-core (Figure 6B)

Similar displacive nodules have been described from the Central Rand QPCs (Figure 6A of England et al., 2002), the Fire Clay coal bed in the Pennsylvanian Breathitt Formation (Figure 5 of Ruppert et al., 2005) and from the lower Jurassic shales from the northeast coast of Yorkshire, England (Figure 6 of Carstens, 1986)The formation of displacive nodules is limited to the sea floor or shallow burial depths where the sediment is characterized by a high degree of plasticity, high fluid content and an isotropic stress field (Selles-Martinez, 1996).

A similar occurrence is recorded from the Devonian Appalachian basin, where local sources of diagenetic pyrite (e.g., pyrite nodules, framboids and pyritized fossils) are incorporated into a syndepositional marine transgressive lag (Formolo and Lyons, 2007).Early diagenetic pyrite analyzed during this investigation is characterized by high concentrations of Ni and As (weight  percent) and low Co/Ni ratios

This observation is not unique, as pyritefree kerogenous shales are reported from many other marine successions of Archean age (Buick, 2009)The absence of pyrite would imply that the coexisting ocean water reservoir was depleted in sulfate or that

The question is, whether sulfatedepletion reflects the composition of the Mesoarchean open ocean (Habicht et al., 2002) or whether it is only an artifact of upwelling of sulfate-depleted hydrothermally enriched deep ocean water onto the Kaapvaal CratonThis question cannot be resolved with the current dataset.

This conclusion is in line with more and more data becoming available to support the presence of at least some free oxygen in ocean water in Meso- and Neoarchean times (Siebert et al., 2005; Anbar et al., 2007).This study has provided unequivocal evidence that the composition and morphology of pyrite in the finegrained sedimentary rocks of the Witwatersrand Supergroup are inextricably linked to the depositional environment and tectonic setting of their host rocks

Still, the survival of detrital pyrite provides strong evidence for a reducing Mesoarchean atmosphere (Farquhar et al., 2000; England et al., 2002; Frimmel, 2005) and its distinct mineral chemical compositions preclude a hydrothermal replacement origin (Phillips and Myers, 1989; Barnicoat et al., 1997)Similarly, the occurrence of proximal pyriterich facies and distal magnetite-rich facies argues against a prominent role of large-scale fluid infiltration and associated pyritization in the West Rand Group (e.g., Frimmel, 1996; Law and Phillips, 2005)
