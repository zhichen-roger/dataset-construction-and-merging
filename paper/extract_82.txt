Although ankerite is a common minor component of many Mesozoic North Sea sandstone reservoirs, the Franklin sandstones contain unusual amounts of it, particularly as concretionsWe have interpreted the carbon in this ankerite as being derived equally from bioclasts and from organic acids (expelled from surrounding source rocks), once reservoir temperatures exceeded the threshold for decarboxylation and/or oxidation
