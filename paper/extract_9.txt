Studies of Cretaceous–Paleogene strata within the Himalayan orogen have provided important insights into the pre- and postcollisional stages of India-Asia plate convergence (Garzanti et al., 1987; Rowley, 1996; DeCelles et al., 2004, 2014; Wu et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2015; Orme et al., 2015; Ding et al., 2016; Najman etal., 2017)

In particular, the Himalayan Paleocene–Eocene detrital record has arguably been acknowledged as one of the most robust and reliable means to track the initial timing of continental collision—defined as the time at which the two continental plates physically come into contact—between India and southern Asia (Hu et al., 2016)Constraints on the initial timing of collision are critical to assess total shortening for models of crustal deformation (e.g., Ingalls et al., 2016), to understand faunal evolution and migration (e.g., Bossuyt and Milinkovitch, 2001), and to model

Interpretations of a late continental collision require a pre-collisional history involving either collision of an intraoceanic arc to India by ∼50 Ma (Khan et al., 2009; Bouilhol et al., 2013; Jagoutz et al., 2019), or Early Cretaceous formation of the Greater India Basin (GIB) and accretion of a micro-continent to southern Asia around 59 Ma (Van Hinsbergen et al., 2019)Models for late intercontinental collision, however, are not fully in accordance with reported shifts in provenance from an Indian to an Asian source observed in Paleocene–lower Eocene strata of the Tethyan Himalaya (TH) across the orogen (Hu et al., 2016).

Models for late intercontinental collision, however, are not fully in accordance with reported shifts in provenance from an Indian to an Asian source observed in Paleocene–lower Eocene strata of the Tethyan Himalaya (TH) across the orogen (Hu et al., 2016).Paleocene strata within the TH have been a focal point in tracking the timing of initial India-Asia contact, as these stratigraphic sections are argued to reflect the northernmost and oldest records for an early India-Asia collision (DeCelles et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2016)

South of the Indus-Yarlung suture, orogen-scale fault systems have deformed rocks of the north paleo-Indian margin and delineate four major tectonostratigraphic zones including, from north to south: the TH of Proterozoic–Eocene metasedimentary and sedimentary rocks; high-grade metamorphic rocks of the Greater Himalaya (GH); the LH of Paleoproterozoic–Cambrian metasedimentary rocks with sparse exposures of younger Phanerozoic rocks; and the Subhimalaya of Himalayan foreland basin deposits (Fig1).

For each model, we explain how provenance findings for Paleocene–middle Eocene strata from the frontal Himalayan system may support or challenge these models.Comparison of paleogeographic reconstructions derived from paleomagnetic data with Himalayan crustal shortening estimates suggest a >1000 km discrepancy, requiring subduction of ∼1000– 3000 km of Indian lithosphere not observed in the accreted rock record (Van Hinsbergen et al., 2012)

To account for this, it has been proposed that Early Cretaceous north-south extension along the north Indian margin separated the GH and TH from the LH, forming the Greater Himalayan microcontinent and the GIB (Van Hinsbergen et al., 2012, 2019; Bhandari et al., 2019)This model requires that the KLA first collided with Asia by ∼92 Ma forming the Shyok suture zone—as supported by an Asian-derived clastic wedge deposited unconformably on the KLA terrane at ∼92–85 Ma (Borneman et al., 2015)

Because the paleogeographic position of lower–middle Eocene deposits of the frontal Himalayan system would be over 2000–3000 km south of Asia (including the accreted KLA) at the time of their deposition, any provenance evidence for Asian and/or KLA derivation in these deposits would challenge this model, or require the GIB to be a purely continental basin.A second model for India–Asia collision holds that the KohistanLakakh arc first collided with the north India margin, as interpreted from paleomagnetic data and the isotopic evolution of KLA magmatism, forming the Indus suture before a later terminal IndiaAsia collision (Khan et al., 2009; Bouilhol et al., 2013; Jagoutz et al., 2019)

This model does not require significant Early Cretaceous extension along the north Indian margin, though minor extension and associated magmatism may have propagated northwest across the north India margin at this time as a response to the breakup of Greater India from Australia and Antarctica (Hu et al., 2010)The timing of KLA collision with India is proposed to have occurred at ∼50 Ma, followed by final collision of India with Asia and formation of the Shyok suture zone by ∼34–40 Ma (Aitchison et al., 2007; Bouilhol et al., 2013) (Fig

Stratigraphic support for this model would require evidence of KLA derived sediment within Paleocene–middle Eocene frontal Himalayan strata, with no indication of an Asian provenance.In contrast to the GIB model, it has been proposed that Paleocene strata of the Sangdanlin section represent the northernmost and oldest record of India-Asia collision, with the arrival of Asian derived detritus at ∼59 Ma reflecting initiation of the earliest stages of collision (DeCelles et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2015) (Fig

Paleoproterozoic–Cambrian low-grade metasedimentary rocks of the LH zone represent the southernmost deposits along the north paleo-Indian margin—resting south of GH and TH protoliths— and exhibit a southern provenance from the Indian continentNotably, detrital zircon U-Pb ages from all LH strata denotes a discrete component of ∼1.6–1.9 Ga grains, which are common across India (McKenzie et al., 2011; Webb et al., 2011; Colleps et al., 2018, 2019) (Fig

In contrast, the detrital zircon age population of the Subathu Formation lacks this prominent ∼1.6–1.9 Ga age component, and instead reveal a relative increase in abundance of Neoproterozoic (∼0.8 Ga) and early Paleozoic grains when compared to the age population of Singtali Formation.This observed shift in the >400 Ma detrital zircon age component between the Singtali Formation and the Subathu Formation indicates that the Subathu Formation did not share the same southern Indian source as the Singtali Formation

However, because lower Paleozoic rocks of the Himalaya generally yield non-unique U-Pb age signatures, this method alone cannot pinpoint a definitive source for these older grains within the Subathu FormationFor this reason—and because no detrital zircon U-Pb ages younger than ∼130 Ma have been recorded from the Bhainskati Formation (DeCelles et al., 2004)—it has been proposed in support of the GIB model that Paleocene–middle Eocene rocks of the frontal Himalayan system were sourced from the west due to a Paleocene-Eocene orogeny along the west-Indian margin unrelated to India–Asia collision (Van Hinsbergen et al., 2019).

Based on these data, we interpret that the majority of the grains within ∼117–150 Ma with negative εHf values were recycled from TH Cretaceous rocks to the north, including the Wölong volcaniclastic rocks (Hu et al., 2010), with a minority of these grains originating from an Asian source.Three Permian grains from the Subathu Formation all yield positive εHf values and overlap the Panjal Traps source field in U-Pb-εHf space (Fig

Compelling evidence for a Transhimalayan source to the Subathu Formation strongly refutes the notion that lower–middle Eocene deposits of the frontal Himalayan system were sourced from an Eocene obduction-related orogen near Pakistan in the west, as proposed in the GIB model (Van Hinsbergen et al., 2019)This proposal for an independent, western orogenic source is additionally contested by statistical support for a TH source of >400 Ma detrital zircon to the Subathu Formation, and a TH source is further corroborated by evidence of Subathu zircon of Panjal Trap affinity sourced from the northwestern Himalaya

Evidence for initial formation of Himalayan leucogranites during the Oligocene—derived solely from metamorphosed crustal sediments with no mantle component or additional heat source—is in support for early collisional models (Hopkinson et al., 2017)Younger India–Asian collision at ∼34–40 Ma would require a widespread mantle melt component to accelerate the rate of Miocene magmatism, though Himalayan leucogranites lack evidence for this (Hopkinson et al., 2017).
