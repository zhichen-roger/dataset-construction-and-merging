However, the initiation age of India–Asia collision is controversial and ranges from the latest Cretaceous (Willems et al., 1996; Yin and Harrison, 2000) to the middle Eocene (Burg etal.,1987;Dingetal.,2005;Searleetal.,1987,Zhuetal.,2005a).Recently, Aitchison's group proposed an alternative multistage collision model that intra-oceanic arc collision and ophiolite obduction with Indian plate occurredduringearlyCenozoicfollowedbyultimatelyIndia–Asiacollision at Eocene/Oligocene boundary (Aitchison, 2000; Aitchison and Davis,2004;Aitchisonetal.,2007a;Davisetal.,2002).ThisalternativeIndia–Asia collision model requires that the southernmost margin of Lhasa terrane retained its approximate present position at ~30°N deduced from Apparent Polar Wander Path of the stable Eurasian plate (Ali and Aitchison, 2004, 2006)

Provenance studies on Eocene strata of the Tethys Himalaya indicated the presence of detritus from the Asian plate suggesting that India–Asia collision had occurred by this time (Ding et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2005a)Rapid changes in sedimentation patterns (Willems et al., 1996) and tectonic subsidence (Rowley, 1998), along with the influx of accretionary prism and trench materials have been found in late Masstrichtian strata in southernTibet (Tingri and Gyangze) and have been attributed to initial India–Asia collision (Liu and Einsele, 1996; Willems et al., 1996; Yin and Harrison, 2000)

During the latest Cretaceous, it has been proposed that the Gangdese arc had already been uplifted to significant elevation and could have shed sediments to basins to both the north and south (DeCelles et al., 2007; Ding and Lai, 2003; Kapp et al., 2005; Kapp et al., 2007; Leier et al., 2007b; Murphy et al., 1997; Wu et al., 2010)Although the fore-arc basin includes Paleocene–Eocene marine strata in the Tso-jiangding area to the west of our study area (Ding et al., 2005), it could have been overfilled in the Xigaze area (Dürr, 1996; Einsele et al., 1994) with sediments shed from the Gangdese arc (Dürr, 1996; Wu et al., 2010), and became a shallow platform setting marking the end of the forearc basin (Wan et al., 1997)

Although the fore-arc basin includes Paleocene–Eocene marine strata in the Tso-jiangding area to the west of our study area (Ding et al., 2005), it could have been overfilled in the Xigaze area (Dürr, 1996; Einsele et al., 1994) with sediments shed from the Gangdese arc (Dürr, 1996; Wu et al., 2010), and became a shallow platform setting marking the end of the forearc basin (Wan et al., 1997)Therefore, detrital sediments could deposit further south to the Indian passive margin across the Xigaze forearc basin which is confirmed by the similarity of detrital zircon patterns between the Zongzhuo Formation and the strata of Xigaze forearc basin (Wu et al., 2010)

Therefore, the transition from the southern Indian provenance of the Jiabula Formation to the northern Gangdese arc source of the Zongzhuo Formation and Rilang conglomerate indicates that the initial collision between the India and Asia plates occurred during Maastrichtian (~70–65 Ma).The initial collision caused flexure of the downgoing Indian plate, and may be responsible for the drastic sedimentary pattern changes from continental shelf to slope (Willems et al., 1996) and the sharp increase in the rate of tectonic subsidence curve (Rowley, 1998), which were observed near Tingri at about 68 Ma in the southern Tethys HimalayaThe initial collision also caused the deformation of the overriding Lhasa terrane, as recorded by major shortening of the late Cretaceous Takena Formation prior to early Tertiary Linzizong Group volcanism.

Paleomagnetic studies show that the southern margin of Lhasa terrane was located at 11.5°N±6.2° during the deposition of the late Cretaceous Takena Formation (Achache et al., 1984)In contrast, the northern margin of the Indian continent was located at ~5°S±5° during 71–65 Ma (Chen et al., 2010; Dupont-Nivet et al., 2010; Patzelt et al., 1996)

Though detailed problems such as the shape and extent of greater India (Ali and Aitchison, 2005), secondary remagnetization (Patzelt et al., 1996), and inclination shallowing (Tan et al., 2010) are still debated, there is an agreement that there was still a huge gap between the Greater Indian continental margin and the Lhasa terraneduringthelatestCretaceous(Chenetal.,2010;Dupont-Nivetetal., 2010; Liebke et al., 2010)Therefore, detrital sediments from the Lhasa terrane were impossible to deposit onto the Indian passive continental margin during late Cretaceous

Initial collision between the India plate and Lhasa terrane during Maastrichtian (~70–65 Ma) is challenged by the enormous amount of subsequent intracontinental shortening requiredEarly India–Asia collision predicts at least 2000 km of intercontinental shortening between 70 Ma and 55 Ma based on the relative convergence rate between India and Asia (Copley et al., 2010)

No Paleocene shortening in the Tethys Himalaya and minimal Paleocene shortening in southern Lhasa terrane make this impossible (Ding et al., 2005)However this record could have been totally subducted beneath the Lhasa block along the YZSZ or occurred further to the north within the entire Tibetan plateau (Yin and Harrison, 2000)

Therefore, the first appearance of Cretaceous zircons with positive εHf(t) and intraoceanic arc-related spinels record the obduction of an intra-oceanic subduction system onto the Indian passive continental margin during Maastrichtian (~70–65 Ma) (Fig9C).

The continental Gangdese arc may have transitioned northwestward into the intra-oceanic Kohistan arc in northern Pakistan and northwestern India which was active during Aptian–Cenomanian (Rolland et al., 2002), and collided with the Karakorum block at 85– 80 Ma (Searle et al., 1999)In Zedong to the east of our study area, geochemical studies indentify a suite of intra-oceanic arc volcanic rocks (Aitchison et al., 2007b)

The scarcity of Cretaceous arc fragments in southern Tibet may be explained by complete northward underthrusting beneath the southern Asian margin (Makovsky et al., 1999).However, considering no accepted intro-oceanic arc was found and the possibility that the very southern edge of the Gangdese arc was built on oceanic crust and thus it also exhibits characteristics of an oceanic arc, we tentatively prefer option (1)
