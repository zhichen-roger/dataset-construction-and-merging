Comparison of detrital zircon spectra from Taimyr and southern Novaya Zemlya reveals a striking similarity between the late Neoproterozoic–Cambrian continental slope deposits of northern Taimyr and the turbidites below the unconformity in southern Novaya ZemlyaThe cumulative frequency peaks of 550– 565 Ma that dominate the northern Taimyr samples are consistent with Timanide ages: Granitoids with crystallization ages of 560– 565 Ma (Gee et al

This late Cambrian to early Ordovician rift– drift transition is penecontemporaneous with the age of the unconformity in southern Novaya Zemlya and Severnaya ZemlyaConsequently, it can be argued that the final Cambrian accretionary event on the Baltica margin recorded in southern Novaya Zemlya was intimately related to the end of the ‘Timanide’ compressional regime, and the subsequent onset of orogenic collapse and continental break-up around the Cambrian–Ordovician boundary was regionally significant
