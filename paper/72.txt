Accelerating exhumation in the Eocene North American Cordilleran hinterland: Implications from detrital zircon (U-Th)/(He-Pb) double datingAndrew S
Following prolonged late Meso zoic–early Cenozoic crustal thickening and plateau construction, the hinterland of the Sevier orogen of western North America underwent late Cenozoic extension and formation of metamorphic core complexesWhile the North American Cordillera is one of Earth’s best-studied orogens, estimates for the spatial and temporal patterns of initial extensional faulting differ greatly and thus limit understanding of potential drivers for deformation
We employed (U-Th)/(He-Pb) double dating of detrital zircon and (U-Th)/He thermo chronology of detrital apatite from precisely dated Paleogene terrestrial strata to quantify the timing and magnitude of exhumation and explore the linkages between tectonic unroofing and basin evolution in northeastern NevadaWe determined sediment provenance and lag time evolution (i.e., the time between cooling and deposition, which is a measure of upper-crustal exhumation) during an 8 m.y
time span of deposition within the Eocene Elko BasinFluvial strata deposited between 49 and 45 Ma yielded Precambrian (U-Th)/He zircon cooling ages (ZHe) with 105–740 m.y
Fluvial strata deposited between 49 and 45 Ma yielded Precambrian (U-Th)/He zircon cooling ages (ZHe) with 105–740 m.ylag times dominated by unreset detrital ages, suggesting limited exhumation and Proterozoic through early Eocene sediment burial (<4–6 km) across the region

44 and 39 Ma strata record Eocene cooling ages with 1–20 m.ylag times
We attribute the observed acceleration in exhumation, expansion of sedimentary basins, and migrating volcanism across the middle Eocene to record the thermal and isostatic effects of Farallon slab rollback and subsequent removal of the lowermost mantle lithosphere.In large orogenic belts, major shortening- related crustal thickening can result in kilometer- scale surface uplift in the hinterland and form an orogenic plateau in the region between the active magmatic arc and frontal fold-and-thrust belt (e.g., DeCelles, 2004; Snell et al., 2014)
These modern plateaus are all characterized by varying degrees of synconvergent crustal extension that initiated in the Miocene or earlier and continues to the present (Bussell and Pitcher, 1985; Allmendinger et al., 1997; Dilek and Moores, 1999; Bonev and Beccaletto, 2007; Horton,GSA Bulletin; January/February 2020; v

Metamorphic core complexes run north to south along the metamorphic axis of the Cordilleran hinterland and represent the location of a Paleogene welt of 50–60-km-thick crust (Fig2C; Coney and Harms, 1984; Dilek and Moores, 1999)
Within the greater Ruby Mountains–East Humboldt Range–Wood Hills–Pequop Mountains metamorphic core complex, initial core complex exhumation has been variably assigned to the Late Cretaceous (Hodges et al., 1992; Camilleri and Chamberlain, 1997; McGrew et al., 2000), Eocene (Wright and Snoke, 1993; McGrew and Snee, 1994; MacCready et al., 1997; Litherland and Klemperer, 2017), or Oligocene–Miocene (Fig2B; Dokka et al., 1986; Hurlow et al., 1991; Colgan et al., 2010; Haines and van der Pluijm, 2010)
In this metamorphic core complex, basement thermobarometry and U-Pb crystallization ages have been interpreted to record exhumation from Cretaceous midcrustal depths (20–30 km; e.g., Dallmeyer et al., 1986; Mueller and Snoke, 1993; Camilleri and Chamberlain, 1997; McGrew et al., 2000; Druschke et al., 2009a; Hallett and Spear, 2014), mica 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology suggests rocks in the southern Ruby Mountains passed through the ~400 °C isotherm between 33 and 21 Ma (Dallmeyer et al., 1986; McGrew and Snee, 1994), and apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry recorded cooling to <70 °C between 17 and 10 Ma (Colgan et al., 2010)However, all of these thermochronometric data do not constrain the crustal thermal evolution prior to cooling through the ~400 °C isotherm and are hence insensitive to the pre–33 Ma exhumation history, despite general agreement on evidence for some degree of Late Cretaceous through Oligocene exhumation (e.g., Snoke and Miller, 1988; McGrew et al., 2000; Satarugsa and Johnson, 2000; Hallett and Spear, 2015; Litherland and Klemperer, 2017)
However, all of these thermochronometric data do not constrain the crustal thermal evolution prior to cooling through the ~400 °C isotherm and are hence insensitive to the pre–33 Ma exhumation history, despite general agreement on evidence for some degree of Late Cretaceous through Oligocene exhumation (e.g., Snoke and Miller, 1988; McGrew et al., 2000; Satarugsa and Johnson, 2000; Hallett and Spear, 2015; Litherland and Klemperer, 2017)Widespread deposition of Paleogene clastic sedimentary rocks, preserved across the hinterland, spanned this time interval and so Paleogene basins would have received both volcanic influx and possible synextensional lower-plate detritus at the time
Widespread deposition of Paleogene clastic sedimentary rocks, preserved across the hinterland, spanned this time interval and so Paleogene basins would have received both volcanic influx and possible synextensional lower-plate detritus at the timeDetrital zircon U-Pb and (U-Th)/He double dating permits identification of volcanic detritus so that it can be excluded from lag-time analysis (Saylor et al., 2012) and exhumation patterns can be assessed
Resulting lag times of Eocene strata provide critical new insights into the kinematic and exhumation history of the hinterland.Eocene fluvial and lacustrine strata in northeastern Nevada range in age from ca
Eocene fluvial and lacustrine strata in northeastern Nevada range in age from ca50 to 38 Ma (Rahl et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2017)
While this early Cenozoic sedimentary record was disrupted by widespread high-angle Neogene extensional faulting and unconformity (Haynes, 2003; Lund Snee et al., 2016;  Camilleri et al., 2017), surviving strata are well dated via singlecrystal sanidine 40Ar/39Ar geochronology (Smith et al., 2017), providing a basis for correlation and reconstruction of basin formation and evolution (Fig1A).
This technique has great utility in the Cordilleran hinterland, where Eocene sedimentary deposits are widely dispersed (Fig2), and they contain zircon grains with complex thermal histories that span the Phanerozoic
2), and they contain zircon grains with complex thermal histories that span the PhanerozoicWhen combined with depositional age control from 40Ar/39Ar geochronology and volcanic zircons constraining maximum depositional ages, detrital zircon double dating provides time-temperature paths of many individual zircon crystals with varying geologic histories and permits documentation of exhumation rates across a large area
This also allows for estimation of lag times, which can be used to reconstruct the early Cenozoic exhumation history of the Cordilleran hinterland in northeastern NevadaThe zircon (U-Th)/(He-Pb) double dating approach is critical for this type of study because first-cycle volcanic zircons (U-Pb age = ZHe age) must be excluded for robust and reliable lag-time analysis (Saylor et al., 2012)
The orogenic thickening of the North American Cordillera reflects the combination of multiple contractional tectonic events from the late Paleozoic to the Paleogene (e.g., Dickinson,Figure 2
(2017); Eocene volcanic centers are from Henry et al(2011); Eocene intrusions and dike orientations are from Henry et al
(2011); Eocene intrusions and dike orientations are from Henry et al(2001), Ressel and Henry (2006), and du Bray (2007)

2006), as well as protracted rifted- and passivemargin sediment accumulation that resulted in an ~11-km-thick succession of Proterozoic– Paleo zoic strata in eastern Nevada (Miller et al., 1992; Camilleri and Chamberlain, 1997; Crafford, 2008; Pape et al., 2016)During the Late Devonian to early Mississippian Antler orogeny, Cambrian through Devonian deep-marine rocks of the Roberts Mountains allochthon were emplaced above the Roberts Mountains thrust over coeval shelf facies of the Cordilleran passivemargin sequence (Fig
During the Late Devonian to early Mississippian Antler orogeny, Cambrian through Devonian deep-marine rocks of the Roberts Mountains allochthon were emplaced above the Roberts Mountains thrust over coeval shelf facies of the Cordilleran passivemargin sequence (Fig1; Trexler et al., 2004; Gehrels and Pecha, 2014; Linde et al., 2016)
The last stages of Antler orogenesis shed up to 2.5 km of clastic detritus (Mississippian Diamond Peak Formation) into the Antler foreland basin of eastern Nevada (Fig1B; Poole, 1974; Silitonga, 1974; Poole and Sandberg, 1977).
Modest burial of Antler and subsequent overlap strata is indicated by low (≤2.5) conodont color alteration indices (CAI) for Pennsylvanian– Triassic rocks (Harris and Crafford, 2007)In contrast, Roberts Mountains allochthon strata, particularly Ordovician strata of the Vinini Formation and Devonian strata of the Slaven Chert, commonly exhibit CAI >3 (Fig
In contrast, Roberts Mountains allochthon strata, particularly Ordovician strata of the Vinini Formation and Devonian strata of the Slaven Chert, commonly exhibit CAI >3 (Fig1A; Harris and Crafford, 2007), implying temperatures of at least 200 °C (Long and Soignard, 2016) and likely complete postdepositional thermal resetting of ZHe ages.
During late Mesozoic times, Farallon plate subduction led to voluminous arc and backarc magmatism (Miller and Hoisch, 1995; Dickinson, 2006) and contractional deformation within the Sierran magmatic arc (Mookerjee et al., 2016), across hinterland fold-and-thrust belts (Long, 2012), and within the Sevier fold-andthrust belt (DeCelles, 2004)In eastern Nevada, Mesozoic deformation was characterized by low-angle faults, long-hinged folds, development of ~2 km of structural relief, and ~10 km of shortening within the Central Nevada fold-andthrust belt (DeCelles, 2004; Long, 2012, 2015)
In eastern Nevada, Mesozoic deformation was characterized by low-angle faults, long-hinged folds, development of ~2 km of structural relief, and ~10 km of shortening within the Central Nevada fold-andthrust belt (DeCelles, 2004; Long, 2012, 2015)In the Late Cretaceous, contraction shifted to a SW-NE orientation and arc magmatism ceased as the angle of the subducting plate shallowed (Humphreys, 2009; Heller et al., 2013)
In the Late Cretaceous, contraction shifted to a SW-NE orientation and arc magmatism ceased as the angle of the subducting plate shallowed (Humphreys, 2009; Heller et al., 2013)This appears to have been associated with minor post-Sevier upper-crustal extension in eastern Nevada (e.g., Druschke et al., 2011)
By this time, the Cordilleran hinterland region had attained elevations of ≥2 km (Snell et al., 2014) and reached up to 3.5 km by the late Oligocene (Cassel et al., 2014)Farallon slab rollback in-
duced southwest-propagating volcanism, basin formation, <1 km of surface uplift, and drainage migration in the Eocene and Oligocene (Janecke and Snee, 1993; Smith et al., 2014, 2017; Cassel et al., 2014, 2018)The potential drivers of hinter land exhumation during this time are uncertain and include thermal weakening induced by slab rollback volcanism (e.g., Gans et al., 1989; Axen et al., 1993; Humphreys, 1995; Dinter, 1998; Rahl et al., 2002; Bendick and Baldwin, 2009; Brun et al., 2016), gravitational collapse of isostatically compensated crust (e.g., Burchfiel and Royden, 1985; Dewey, 1988; Platt, 2007), and lithospheric removal (e.g.,
Detrital zircon from Eocene sandstone samples was double dated using (U-Th)/(He-Pb), and detrital apatite was analyzed using (U-Th)/He thermochronometry (Fig3)
While these effects become more amplified in samples with pre-Cenozoic cooling histories, we choseto minimize these effects: No metamict grains were selected; all selected double-dated zircon grains had eU concentrations of <800 ppm; and >97 percent of analyzed grains had eU concentrations of <400 ppm, based on the LA-ICP-MS U-Pb analyses of the same grains (Fig
Nearly all detrital zircon and apatite grains that met the selection criteria discussed above and were not volcanic in origin (U-Pb age older than Eocene) were selected from each U-Pb dated sample for thermochronology.Lag time (L) is the difference between the cooling age and the depositional age for an individual detrital grain, and it provides a measure of hinterland exhumation rate, ignoring the fluvial transport duration (Brandon and Vance, 1992; Garver et al., 1999; Carrapa et al., 2003; Ruiz et al., 2004; Carrapa and DeCelles, 2008; Painter et al., 2014; Thomson et al., 2017)

We generated 949 detrital zircon U-Pb ages and 137 detrital zircon (U-Th)/He ages from Eocene Elko Formation samples (Table 2)No zircon He ages were younger than the depositional age within 2σ uncertainties
Of samples deposited between 50 and 38 Ma, 9 percent of all double- dated detrital grains yielded Eocene cooling ages, whereas 31 percent yielded identical cooling and crystallization ages between 52 and 38 MaOf the remaining 69 percent of detrital zircon grains, 22 percent yielded crystallization and cooling ages

4), two grains gave Jurassic– Cretaceous U-Pb ages and Eocene He agesTwo Elko Formation samples and the Diamond Peak Formation sample showed a negative ZHe age–eU correlation (NV12-040CM, NV15168RM, and NV15-013PR; Fig
From 50 to 40 Ma, detrital zircon grains show an up-section shift from predominantly long (>100 m.y.) to short (<10 m.y.) lag times across the EoceneThe 50–45 Ma samples yielded >70 percent of grains with >100 m.y
In contrast, middle to late-middle Eocene samples showed a substantial component of very long (>500 m.y.) zircon grain lag times, but they also had zircon and apatite grains with <10 m.ylag-time values
This abrupt middle Eocene transition from low to high zircon grain cooling rates was both spatially and temporally synchronous with lake basin expansion and the arrival of volcanism at ca44 Ma (Fig
Detrital apatite extracted from three Eocene samples (n = 20) yielded predominantly late Cenozoic (U-Th)/He ages and lesser amounts of Eocene and Cretaceous cooling ages (Fig6)
Prior determination of CAI values for Paleozoic–Mesozoic strata in northeastern Nevada showed that Mississippian–Triassic strata proximal to the Elko Basin generally have low values (CAI ≤2.5) that imply a lack of postdepositional heating beyond ~140 °C (Harris and Crafford, 2007)Additionally, the Mississippian Diamond Peak Formation sample (Fig

Low CAI values for proximal Paleozoic sedimentary rocks indicate that preservation of only partially reset pre-Neogene apatite He ages in Mississippian–Triassic strata is plausibleThe Roberts Mountains allochthon, however, lies to the west of the Elko Basin and commonly exhibits CAI >3 (Harris and Crafford, 2007), indicating substantial postdepositional heating (>200 °C; Fig
Elko Formation strata deposited near the Ruby Mountains–East Humboldt Range (e.g., NV12-102EH) contain apatite that was thermally reset during postdepositional burial and later exhumed during Miocene Basin and Range extension, with 89 percent of grains possessing 20–9 Ma He agesThe Eocene apatite He ages that were not reset suggest cooling of proximal source terranes at ca
The Eocene apatite He ages that were not reset suggest cooling of proximal source terranes at ca44 Ma and continued cooling until at least 39 Ma (Fig
Eocene detrital zircon grains have crystallization and cooling ages that reflect a variety of Precambrian to Eocene tectonic pathways.Precambrian U-Pb detrital zircon ages are interpreted to be derived from the Appalachians (Dickinson and Gehrels, 2009), and of those grains, 25 percent yielded Late Devonian–Late Triassic ZHe ages recording either the widespread thermo-tectonic effects of Antler and Sonoma orogenesis or thermo-tectonic events in the original Appalachian sources (Fig

PostMississippian pooled ZHe ages from the Elko Formation clustered in at least five groups that loosely correlate with apparent cooling events during the Early Permian, Early–Middle Triassic, Late Jurassic, Early Cretaceous, and middle Eocene (Fig6)
We interpret the Early Permian ages to result from Antler orogenic deformation (e.g., Trexler et al., 2004).Precambrian zircon U-Pb crystallization age populations (1.8, 2.1, and 2.7 Ga) in several Eocene samples resemble the detrital zircon populations from the proximal Mississippian Diamond Peak Formation (Fig
Precambrian zircon U-Pb crystallization age populations (1.8, 2.1, and 2.7 Ga) in several Eocene samples resemble the detrital zircon populations from the proximal Mississippian Diamond Peak Formation (Fig5A)
Grains interpreted to be derived from the Diamond Peak Formation are characterized by 64 percent Precambrian ZHe ages and 28 percent Paleozoic ZHe ages, and only 2 out of 24 grains have post-Mississippian ZHe ages (Fig5A)
Eocene samples that preserve pre-Mississippian cooling ages therefore possibly reflect derivation from the Diamond Peak Formation and likely other strata of the Late Devonian–middle Pennsylvanian Antler foreland basinSimilarly, Cretaceous sediments of the Newark Canyon Formation are also inferred to have been derived from erosion of proximal Antler foreland basin strata (Druschke et al., 2011), based on detrital zircon results, and they may also have sourced zircon grains with Precambrian crystallization ages.
Similarly, Cretaceous sediments of the Newark Canyon Formation are also inferred to have been derived from erosion of proximal Antler foreland basin strata (Druschke et al., 2011), based on detrital zircon results, and they may also have sourced zircon grains with Precambrian crystallization ages.We used the above information to highlight four schematic cooling trajectories for Elko Formation detrital zircon grains (Fig
6), including (A) erosion of Roberts Mountains allochthon strata followed by Cretaceous and Eocene recycling at shallow crustal depths, (B) recycling of Roberts Mountains allochthon strata into the Antler foreland basin (Diamond Peak Formation) and retention in the shallow crust, (C) burial of Roberts Mountains allochthon strata during the Antler orogeny followed by late Paleozoic cooling above the zircon closure temperature, and (D) burial of Roberts Mountains allochthon strata during the Antler orogeny, retention below the zircon closure temperature, and rapid Eocene exhumationOf these trajectories, only time-temperature path D can account for zircon grains with pre-Jurassic U-Pb ages and Eocene He ages.
Of these trajectories, only time-temperature path D can account for zircon grains with pre-Jurassic U-Pb ages and Eocene He ages.A comparison of He and depositional ages for detrital zircon grains with Jurassic and Cretaceous U-Pb ages (200–110 Ma) showed that a subset of these grains was rapidly exhumed from ~6 to 9 km depth between ca
A comparison of He and depositional ages for detrital zircon grains with Jurassic and Cretaceous U-Pb ages (200–110 Ma) showed that a subset of these grains was rapidly exhumed from ~6 to 9 km depth between ca45 and 40 Ma (Fig
Thermobarometry of Late Jurassic backarc plutons in eastern Nevada and western Utah delineates a zone of relatively shallow (<7 km) plutonic emplacement roughly to the north and west of the Ruby Mountains–East Humboldt Range–Wood Hills–Pequop Mountains metamorphic core complex and a zone of deeper (>7 km) plutonic emplacement to the east and south of the metamorphic core complex (Miller and Hoisch, 1995)Samples collected closest to the Ruby Mountains (168RM, 241RM, and 102EH) have the lowest Δt values: ~25 m.y
for Jurassic and Cretaceous detrital zircon grains, where Δt is the time between crystallization and cooling (Fig5B)
Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous volcanic zircon grains (169–142 Ma) were likely derived from air-fall tuffs associated with a Sierra Nevada high-flux event (Fig5B; DeCelles and Graham, 2015) or the Jurassic Frenchie Creek Volcanics in the proximal Cortez Mountains (Muffler, 1964; Hollingsworth et al., 2018)
5B; DeCelles and Graham, 2015) or the Jurassic Frenchie Creek Volcanics in the proximal Cortez Mountains (Muffler, 1964; Hollingsworth et al., 2018)Several samples deposited between 50 and 39 Ma contained detrital zircon grains with Δt values that equal zero within 2σ analytical uncertainty, suggesting these are first-cycle volcanic grains
All double-dated zircon grains with Eocene U-Pb ages were found to be first-cycle volcanic in nature (L = 0), implying that Eocene plutons were likely not yet unroofed at this timeIf Eocene plutons were synkinematically emplaced during rapid exhumation, however, they may approximate L = 0.
If Eocene plutons were synkinematically emplaced during rapid exhumation, however, they may approximate L = 0.Lag-time trends and detrital He age distributions in the early and middle Eocene were evaluated for three intervals: 50–45 Ma (n = 43), 45–43 Ma (n = 12), and 43–41 Ma (n = 53) to determine sediment recycling and exhumation trends and ultimately to reconstruct the tectonic setting during deposition and basin development.

All early to early–middle Eocene samples also contained zircon with U-Pb ages consistent with derivation from the proximal Roberts Mountains allochthon and Antler foreland basin strataLong-term storage of this sediment in the shallow crust is reflected by overlapping U-Pb age distributions of Paleozoic passive-margin strata (Fig

A sample collected from the Tuscarora Mountains contains 51 percent middle Eocene detrital zircon U-Pb grain ages, implying substantial sediment contributions from proximal volcanic rocks by 44 ± 0.4 MaNumerous volcanic and volcaniclastic horizons, commonly <10 cm thick, are interc alated with Elko Formation strata and represent ash-fall deposits from encroaching volcanism (Smith et al., 2017)
Two detrital apatite grains deposited at 43.9 ± 0.5 Ma near Robinson Mountain, however, have Eocene He ages (55.5 ± 3.3 Ma and 53.2 ± 3.2 Ma) that may reflect incipient upper-crust unroofing not yet recorded by the ZHe agesWe interpret these detrital apatite grains to be sourced from Jurassic plutonic rocks exposed ~20 km to the west in the Cortez Mountains (Hollingsworth et al., 2018)
We interpret these detrital apatite grains to be sourced from Jurassic plutonic rocks exposed ~20 km to the west in the Cortez Mountains (Hollingsworth et al., 2018)Detrital zircon grains from this sample include 39 percent Jurassic U-Pb ages, which match these sources as well
Detrital zircon grains from this sample include 39 percent Jurassic U-Pb ages, which match these sources as wellSince apatite grains were not double dated, it is also possible that apatite grains with Eocene AHe ages are volcanic in origin
Since apatite grains were not double dated, it is also possible that apatite grains with Eocene AHe ages are volcanic in originFor this reason, all apatite grains were excluded from lag-time analysis
Large climate-induced changes to the erosion rate are also unlikely during the studied time interval as (1) the Cordilleran hinterland is broadly characterized by low-magnitude erosional exhumation (Long, 2012), (2) Elko Formation deposition did not coincide with the middle Eocene climatic optimum (MECO; Smith et al., 2017), and (3) there is no notable increase in Elko Basin sediment accumulation ratesAn elevated geothermal gradient during the middle Eocene, however, is possibly supported by 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb dating of proximal Carlin trend mineralization to between 42 and 36 Ma (Arehart et al., 2003; Cline et al., 2005)
An elevated geothermal gradient during the middle Eocene, however, is possibly supported by 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb dating of proximal Carlin trend mineralization to between 42 and 36 Ma (Arehart et al., 2003; Cline et al., 2005)However, even assuming an extremely high geothermal gradient of ~130 °C/km during middle Eocene regional magmatism (Giordano et al., 2016), rapid cooling rates and exhumation of >1 km/m.y
However, even assuming an extremely high geothermal gradient of ~130 °C/km during middle Eocene regional magmatism (Giordano et al., 2016), rapid cooling rates and exhumation of >1 km/m.ywould still be required within the Elko Basin catchment.
This rapid tectonic unroofing, recorded by ZHe cooling ages, contemporaneous regional northwest-striking dike swarms and shallow pluton emplacement (Henry and Boden, 1997, 1998; Henry et al., 1999; R essel and Henry, 2006), evidence for extensional reactivation of pre-Mesozoic faults (Cline et al., 2005; Ressel and Henry, 2006), and associated Au mineralization along the western margin of the Elko Basin (Arehart et al., 2003; Cline et al., 2005) all support extensional deformation within the Elko Basin catchment at this timeSeveral studies have also used mapped angular unconformities within volcanic rocks overlying Elko Formation strata to document surface-breaching extensional deformation during this time (e.g., Brooks et al., 1995; Mueller et al., 1999; Henry et al., 2001; Haynes, 2003; Lund Snee et al., 2016; Pape et al., 2016)
The noted absence of distinctive synextensional Elko Formation strata may reflect extensive Miocene sediment burial and cover of Eocene strata (Moore et al., 1983; Camilleri et al., 2017) or only limited fault control on basin accommodation (Fig7; Smith et al., 2017)
This study is the first to provide quantitative constraints on the magnitude and timing of Paleogene exhumation, which permits evaluation of the drivers of hinterland extension and the resulting implications for the evolution of the Cordilleran hinterland plateau.Zircon grains with <10 m.y
Within the East Humboldt Range and northern Ruby Mountains, crustal flow and extensional exhumation along the mylonitic shear zone are thought to have initiated in the Eocene (Mueller and Snoke, 1993; MacCready et al., 1997), but the thermochronologic record of rocks currently exposed at the surface are dominated by late Oligocene–Miocene cooling ages (Fig8)
To ascertain the nature of Eocene core complex development, additional thermochronology of rocks from a wider range of structural levels is needed, including directly beneath the Ruby detachment faultIt is also possible, however, that this early exhumation record is eroded and only now preserved within the Elko Basin (Fig
While mylonitic clasts of the core complex do not appear in adjacent basins until the Miocene (Colgan et al., 2010; McGrew and Snoke, 2015; Lund Snee et al., 2016), unroofing of >6 km of Precambrian–Pennsylvanian sedimentary strata (Colgan et al., 2010) prior to exposure of the mylonitic crystalline core may have initiated during the Eocene (McGrew and Snee, 1994; MacCready et al., 1997; McGrew et al., 2000; Litherland and Klemperer, 2017)Several metamorphic core complexes in the northern Rocky Mountains record cooling ages that possibly correlate with this initial phase of rapid extension at ca
The high middle Eocene cooling rates from samples collected near the incipient Ruby Mountains–East Humboldt Range–Wood Hills–Pequop Mountains metamorphic core complex may reflect cooling of partially molten crust along a high geothermal gradient (Whitney et al., 2013)If these shortlag-time grains were sourced from the Ruby Mountains–East Humboldt Range–Wood Hills– Pequop Mountains metamorphic core complex, it would imply that the core complex was characterized by episodes of fast cooling initiating in the middle Eocene, rather than monotonous and protracted cooling (i.e., Rey et al., 2009b).
If these shortlag-time grains were sourced from the Ruby Mountains–East Humboldt Range–Wood Hills– Pequop Mountains metamorphic core complex, it would imply that the core complex was characterized by episodes of fast cooling initiating in the middle Eocene, rather than monotonous and protracted cooling (i.e., Rey et al., 2009b).Volcanism in northern Nevada began as early as 45–44 Ma (Fig
Basin-proximal magmatism began in the Tuscarora volcanic field at 40.2 Ma (Henry, 2008), and Eocene dikes and plutons intruded this area from 41 to 39 Ma (Henry and Boden, 1997, 1998; Henry et al., 1999; Ressel and Henry, 2006)The thermal effects of slab removal may induce localized extension, including initial core complex extension, directly prior to voluminous phases of volcanism associated with the rollback-driven influx of asthenosphere (Lister and Davis, 1989; Smith et al., 2014)
Middle Eocene Y-rich growth zones on metamorphic zircons in the East Humboldt Range, as well as volcanic and intrusive rocks across northeastern Nevada (e.g., Henry and Boden, 1997; du Bray, 2007), record this peak phase of heating during slab-removal magmatism from ca40 to 32 Ma (Hallett and Spear, 2015)
Identification of rapid middle Eocene cooling rates during a previously unconstrained phase of deformation in the Cordilleran hinterland reveals a pivotal transition from slow to rapid exhumation, accommodated by an initial pulse of extensional deformationRecent paleoaltimetry shows that this region remained at high elevations of 2.7–3.1 km from 41 to 28 Ma (Cassel et al., 2014, 2018) and indicates that this extension did not result in widespread surface lowering
During the late Eocene and early Oligocene, an unconformity across most of northeastern Nevada indicates that slab removal was followed by ~20 m.yof diminished surface deformation, prior to Miocene orogenic collapse (Colgan and Henry, 2009).
of diminished surface deformation, prior to Miocene orogenic collapse (Colgan and Henry, 2009).A compilation of magmatic and syn- to postcontractional records of extension within the North American Cordillera reveals several similarities to the tectonic evolution of other regions that have a history of synextensional magmatism and/or slab rollback (e.g., Stockli, 2005; Bonev and Beccaletto, 2007; Druschke et al., 2009b; Molnar et al., 2010; Wells et al., 2012; Horton, 2018; Rabillard et al., 2018)
40 Ma, initial exhumation of metamorphic core complexes was accompanied by Paleogene basin formation and synextensional magmatism (Jolivet et al., 2003; Bonev and Beccaletto, 2007)The Basin and Range and Aegean/ Cycladic provinces therefore share a history of postcontractional basin formation and initial core complex exhumation during volcanism, all prior to widespread extension >20 m.y
(U-Th)/(He-Pb) double dating shows that zircon grains in Eocene fluvial strata were predominantly derived from local Paleozoic strata, Jurassic–Cretaceous backarc plutons, and Eocene felsic volcanic rocksEocene sandstones contain multicycle zircon grains with Precambrian crystallization ages and Precambrian through Eocene cooling ages, as well as an increasing proportion of younger (150–40 Ma) ZHe ages up section, suggesting formation or capture of newly exhumed source terranes.
Eocene sandstones contain multicycle zircon grains with Precambrian crystallization ages and Precambrian through Eocene cooling ages, as well as an increasing proportion of younger (150–40 Ma) ZHe ages up section, suggesting formation or capture of newly exhumed source terranes.Early to middle Eocene samples contain abundant 56–45 Ma volcanic detritus that likely originated from the Challis volcanic province
Early to middle Eocene samples contain abundant 56–45 Ma volcanic detritus that likely originated from the Challis volcanic provinceWe interpret an up-section decrease in sediment source diversity based on the sudden middle Eocene disappearance of Challis-age grains and coincident increase in 43–39 Ma volcaniclastic material, reflecting increased exhumation and erosion of proximal sources.
We interpret an up-section decrease in sediment source diversity based on the sudden middle Eocene disappearance of Challis-age grains and coincident increase in 43–39 Ma volcaniclastic material, reflecting increased exhumation and erosion of proximal sources.Many detrital zircon grains extracted from Eocene sedimentary rocks preserve Precambrian (32 percent) and Paleozoic (13 percent) cooling ages, and several samples show a negative correlation between He age and eU concentration, indicative of muted exhumation and prolonged sediment recycling in the upper crust across the contractile phase of the North American Cordillera
Many detrital zircon grains extracted from Eocene sedimentary rocks preserve Precambrian (32 percent) and Paleozoic (13 percent) cooling ages, and several samples show a negative correlation between He age and eU concentration, indicative of muted exhumation and prolonged sediment recycling in the upper crust across the contractile phase of the North American Cordillera(4) A progressive decrease in lag times of detrital grains up section indicates acceleration of source exhumation from rates of <0.01 km/m.y
This extension was localized in spatial extent, with consistent recycling of Paleozoic bedrock detritus, and it likely signifies the initiation of rapid core complex exhumationAn ~15 m.y
