There was a large shift toward more juvenile Hf isotopic values at 16 Ma that is consistent with renewed extension in the backarc during the NeogeneOverall geochemical trends in the Neuquén Basin section of the Andean arc are different from those observed in the central (21°S–26°S) and southern Andean arc (41°S–46°S), suggesting a segmented margin with variable tectonic settings and arc processes controlling magmatic output and chemistry along strike.

The Andean magmatic arc of central Chile and Argentina has been active since at least 190 Ma (Hervé et al., 1988; Franzese et al., 2003) with variable volcanic output caused by changing tectonic regimes, including extension from the Late Triassic to Late Cretaceous(Sagripanti et al., 2013), contraction from the Late Cretaceous to Eocene (Tunik et al., 2010; Di Giulio et al., 2012), and variable extension and contraction along strike in the late Paleogene to Neogene (Ramos and Kay, 2006)

Periods of regional shortening and crustal thickening in northern Argentina and southern Bolivia correlate with high-flux events and periods of lithospheric removal (DeCelles et al., 2009, 2015)According to these models, the underthrusting of continental lower crust and mantle lithosphere under the arc produces periodic high-flux magmatism characterized by more evolved isotopic compositions because of melting of crustal material (Ducea, 2001; Haschke et al., 2002).

The arc narrowed again between 28 and 8 Ma, was inactive from 8 to 3 Ma, and volcanism from the Pliocene to the present is concentrated in a narrow zone (Herve et al., 1988; Haschke et al., 2006)Initial Sr and Nd isotopes between 200 and 20 Ma evolved from crust-like to mantle-like ratios, with a reversal at 20 Ma to more diffuse and crust-like ratios (Haschke et al., 2006).

In order to assess arc behavior through time and its relations with orogenic scale processes, I sampled and analyzed Middle Jurassic to Neogene strata from the Neuquén Basin to determine detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra and Hf isotopic compositionsThe goals of this study are to (1) identify the geochronologic and geochemical markers associated with variable tectonic regimes in a Cordilleran-style volcanic arc by comparing and analyzing the retroarc basin detrital record; and (2) evaluate the detrital record of magmatism along strike by comparing the Neuquén Andes (34°S–40°S) with the central (21°S–26°S) and southern (41°S–46°S) Andes
