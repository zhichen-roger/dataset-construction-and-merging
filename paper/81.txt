Trace element abundances in zircons from Triassic intrusive (n = 109) and Jurassic intrusive and extrusive rocks (n = 74); stars are zircons from extrusive rocksBoth suites are U-enriched and Yb-depleted compared to zircons from mid-oceanic-ridge gabbros (MORG; Grimes et al., 2007), and show signifi cant fractionation-induced elemental covariation.
zircons from Triassic intrusive rocks have characteristically lower Th/U and higher Yb/Gd than zircons from intrusive and extrusive rocks of Jurassic age (Fig2)
This, in turn, implies that contrasting ratios between Triassic and Jurassic zircons refl ect a change in trace element composition of intermediate to silicic melts over this time period.GEOLOGY, February 2013; v
Comparison of key zircon trace element ratios, illustrating higher Th/U and lower Yb/Gd characteristic of Jurassic zircons.In order to gauge whether these differences in melt compositions over time are persistent and regionally signifi cant, we turn to the longerterm average arc record in detrital zircons
The California arc formed as a consequence of prolonged Mesozoic subduction beneath the former passive margin of western North America (Saleeby et al., 1992)The arc is composed of a northern, continent-fringing arc segment primarily exposed in the Sierra Nevada, and a southern, continental arc segment exposed in the Salinian Block, Mojave Desert, and Transverse Ranges
The Cretaceous intrusive history of this arc has been intensely studied, but questions remain for the arc as a whole, which can be addressed from the detrital recordSignifi cant ambiguities include the interplay between prolonged subduction and the apparent pulsed nature of magmatism, and the petrogenetic relationships between exposed plutons and volcanic rocks now largely removed by erosion.
Pluton ages defi ne three magmatic pulses: p1 in Triassic, p2 in Middle and Late Jurassic, and p3 in mid-Early to Late Cretaceous timeBetween these pulses, the arc apparently transitioned to magmatic lulls, episodes of less voluminous yet continued activity, l1 beginning in Late Triassic and l2 in latest Jurassic time
Between these pulses, the arc apparently transitioned to magmatic lulls, episodes of less voluminous yet continued activity, l1 beginning in Late Triassic and l2 in latest Jurassic timeDifferences between the Sierra Nevada and Salinia-Mojave age distributions refl ect the migratory nature of arc magmatism and the relatively outboard position of the Sierra Nevada, where the full Cretaceous arc but only the outboard fringes of the older arcs are exposed.
Differences between the Sierra Nevada and Salinia-Mojave age distributions refl ect the migratory nature of arc magmatism and the relatively outboard position of the Sierra Nevada, where the full Cretaceous arc but only the outboard fringes of the older arcs are exposed.Such chronologic records are incomplete, because the plutonic arc is not fully exhumed, and associated volcanic and epizonal plutonic rocks have been eroded
Upper panel: Probability plots of zircon U-Pb ages of plutonic rocks from the fringing arc (Irwin and Wooden, 2001; Saleeby et al., 2008; Barth et al., 2011) and from the continental arc (Barth and Wooden, 2006; Barth et al., 2008; Needy et al., 2009), compared to detrital zircons from uppermost Jurassic to middle Eocene sedimentary sequences on the outboard side of the arc, including the Great Valley Group (DeGraaff-Surpless et al., 2002; Wright and Wyld, 2007), analogous forearcbasin deposits of southern California (Jacobson et al., 2011), underplated trench sediments (Pelona-Orocopia-Rand schists; Grove et al., 2003), and Upper Jurassic to Upper Cretaceous retro-arc sediments (McCoy Mountains Formation; Barth et al., 2004)Lower panel: Zircon geochemistry over the same time frame as in upper panel
About a third of the detrital zircons yield Archean to Mesoproterozoic ages, indicating that sediment was derived from the continental segment of the arc.In order to systematically compare melt compositions through time in detrital zircons derived from variably fractionated zircon suites, we grouped arc-derived detrital zircons within 10 m.y
Long-term high Th/U is a characteristic of the Proterozoic crustal framework of the continental segment of the California arc (Wooden and Miller, 1990), so the relatively high Th/U that characterizes magmatic pulses suggests enhanced involvement of fertile crustal rocks during times of high magma production (Ducea and Barton, 2007)Hughes and Mahood (2008) showed that caldera-forming eruptions indicative of voluminous magmatism in modern arc crust are associated with moderately high normal convergence rates and are favored in compressional upper plate settings, consistent with our suggestion that pulse magmas record crustal involvement above that of the background magma fl ux
Low U/Yb in Jurassic time may record reduced ingress of slab-derived fl uid, which when coupled with low Th/U and high Yb/Gd indicates that minimal crustal involvement may be related to phases of large-scale extension or transtension during l1 compared to l2 (Saleeby et al., 1992)Additional detrital records of this type, particularly longitudinal transects that compare forearc to retro-arc records, are likely to provide higher-resolution records of melt variations and greater insights into the evolution of this long-lived, asymmetrical continental and continent-fringing arc system.
