An Early Mesozoic transcontinental palaeoriver in South China: evidence fromZHENBING SHE1,2, CHANGQIAN MA1,2*, YUSHENG WAN3, JINYANG ZHANG4, MIN LI2,
Abstract: Detrital zircon geochronology reveals that Late Triassic–Early Jurassic fluvial sandstones from the major basins of the South China Craton have similar age patterns and define four populations at 2.6–2.4 Ga, 2.0–1.7 Ga, 850–700 Ma and 480–210 MaThe late Palaeoproterozoic group is predominant in all of the five samples, and yielded remarkable age peaks at c
Palaeocurrent analysis of the Early Mesozoic sandstones shows predominant west- and NW-directed palaeoflows, supporting derivation of the sediments from the Cathaysia BlockThe remarkable similarities in provenance signatures and spatial changes of lithofacies of the Triassic– Jurassic around the South China Craton delineate an east–west-trending sedimentary zone extending from Korea to West China
The remarkable similarities in provenance signatures and spatial changes of lithofacies of the Triassic– Jurassic around the South China Craton delineate an east–west-trending sedimentary zone extending from Korea to West ChinaAccumulation of these sediments was probably related to the development of an active continental margin produced by westward subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific Plate
2000 km long westerly draining transcontinental palaeoriver probably had existed in the Early Mesozoic and fed the basins in Korea, South China and West China.Supplementary material: Sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe and laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry zircon U–Th–Pb and Hf isotope data are available at www.geolsoc.org.uk/SUP18514.
East Asia underwent many dramatic changes in the Mesozoic Era, including closure of the Palaeo-Tethyan Ocean, amalgamation of major continental blocks and transition from a Palaeo-Tethyan to a Palaeo-Pacific regimeBeing located at the juncture of the PalaeoTethyan and the Palaeo-Pacific domains, the South China Craton has long been considered to hold the key to understanding the Mesozoic tectonics of East Asia and thus has received much attention (e.g
Being located at the juncture of the PalaeoTethyan and the Palaeo-Pacific domains, the South China Craton has long been considered to hold the key to understanding the Mesozoic tectonics of East Asia and thus has received much attention (e.gHsu et al
However, intensive Cretaceous and Cenozoic continental rifting, accompanied by rift-related magmatism and sedimentation, has extensively modified the Early Mesozoic structural systems and palaeogeographical configurations such that they remain poorly understood.Syntectonic clastic sedimentary rocks commonly preserve a wealth of information on their source terranes and are frequently used to solve tectonic problems (e.g
In South China, Late Triassic–Early Jurassic fluvial and lacustrine deposits are widely developed in response to Mesozoic tectonic changes, marking the transition from a Palaeozoic carbonate platform to a Mesozoic continental environment (Wang 1985)They are mainly preserved in the margins of major Mesozoic– Cenozoic basins of the Yangtze Block, including the Pingle, Yueshan, Jianghan and Sichuan basins, and are sparsely distributed on the Cathaysia Block (Fig
They are mainly preserved in the margins of major Mesozoic– Cenozoic basins of the Yangtze Block, including the Pingle, Yueshan, Jianghan and Sichuan basins, and are sparsely distributed on the Cathaysia Block (Fig1)
In addition, Middle–Late Triassic turbidites were deposited in the Songpan–Ganzi basin in West China, making it the largest exposed Triassic section in the world (Nie et al1994; She et al
However, similar work on Jurassic sandstones of the Yueshan Basin to the east and the Jianghan Basin to the south (Fig1) suggests sediment derivation from the South China Craton rather than the Qinling– Dabie Orogen (Li et al
In this paper, we present 428 U–Pb ages and 112 Hf isotope analyses of detrital zircons and 492 palaeocurrent measurements for Late Triassic–Early Jurassic sandstones from the major Mesozoic–Cenozoic basins of South ChinaThese data provide new insights into the provenance of the syntectonic sediments, as well as the Early Mesozoic tectonics and palaeogeography of East Asia.
These data provide new insights into the provenance of the syntectonic sediments, as well as the Early Mesozoic tectonics and palaeogeography of East Asia.The South China Craton is composed of the Yangtze Block in the NW and the Cathaysia Block in the SE (Fig
1), which were assembled in the Neoproterozoic, giving rise to the Jiangnan Orogen (Zhao & Cawood 1999).The Yangtze Block is largely covered by Neoproterozoic to

Palaeozoic marine sedimentary rocks, upon which a few Mesozoic– Cenozoic continental basins developed (Wang 1985)The exposed Archaean basement is known only in the Kongling Terrane of the Yangtze Gorges area (Gao et al
In contrast, Neoproterozoic magmatic rocks with ages from 1.0 Ga to 700 Ma are widespread across the block, the origin of which remains controversial (e.gZhou et al
2009), and is characterized by intensive crustal reworking during the Mesozoic and mid-Palaeozoic (e.gWan et al
In contrast, in southwestern Cathaysia the basement comprises largely Neoproterozoic sedimentary sequences, which yield Neoarchaean (2.6–2.5 Ga), Grenvillian (c1.0 Ga) and Neoproterozoic (800–700 Ma) zircons (Yu et al
1.0 Ga) and Neoproterozoic (800–700 Ma) zircons (Yu et al2010).
The southern Qinling, however, is characterized by a thick pile of Ediacaran to Middle Triassic sediments and wide occurrence of Early Mesozoic (220–180 Ma) granitoids (Sun et al2002), although Palaeozoic (c
The Dabie Orogen, extending eastward from the Qinling segment, consists of Precambrian metamorphic rocks that underwent ultrahighpressure (UHP) metamorphism during the Triassic (Zhang et al2009, and references therein) and subsequently were intruded by numerous Cretaceous granitoids (e.g
2009, and references therein) and subsequently were intruded by numerous Cretaceous granitoids (e.gMa et al
The Jiangnan Orogen, which lies along the SE margin of the Yangtze Block, is a NE–SW-trending tectonostratigraphic zone composed of deformed early Neoproterozoic (860–830 Ma) strata that are unconformably overlain by undeformed late Neoproterozoic strata (820–730 Ma) (Zhao et al2011).
The Late Triassic–Early Jurassic sedimentary rocks in the northern part of the South China Craton typically consist of two coal- bearing, fluvial–lacustrine sequences, unconformably overlying the Late Palaeozoic–Middle Triassic Yangtze carbonate platform and underlying Middle Jurassic red bedsLate Triassic–Early Jurassic strata in the study area range in thickness from about 300 to 1000 m, and are estimated to be rhaetian to Hettangian in age based on their fossil assemblages (BGMrAP 1982; BGMrJP 1984; BGMrHP 1990; BGMrSP 1991)

Coal measures have been extensively mined from the Upper Triassic–Lower Jurassic sequence in most of the basins, and carbonized plant material is abundant in some horizonsLenticular or sheet-like sandstone bodies with tabular cross-stratification are commonly observed in outcrops extending from the Yueshan Basin in the east to the Sichuan Basin in the west
Samples of medium- to fine-grained sandstone were collected from Late Triassic–Early Jurassic outcrops in the Pingle (Ay14), Jianghan (Pq19) and Sichuan (Es02, Zs11 and Zs63) basins (Fig1)
About 500 palaeocurrent measurements were obtained from Late Triassic–Early Jurassic sandstones in the Yueshan, Jianghan and Sichuan basinsThe sites are identified by locality number in Figure 1b
For the Sichuan basin, although limited data reveal complex palaeoflows (Figs 1 and 2: locations 6, 7, 13, 14 and 15) that suggest multiple sources for this large Late Triassic–Early Jurassic deposit, westerly palaeocurrents are also present.Zircon crystals were separated from the samples using standard crushing and separation techniques, and then mounted in epoxy
A striking feature of the detrital zircon age patterns for the Early Mesozoic sedimentary rocks of the South China Craton is the dominant 2.0– 1.7 Ga population, which accounts for 41–56 percent of the totalInterestingly, all the samples define prominent age peaks at c
These include the Lower– Middle Jurassic Daedong Supergroup in the western Korean Peninsula (Fig6a), the Upper Triassic in Wenbinshan, southeastern Cathaysia (Fig

6f) and the Middle–Upper Triassic in Songpan–Ganzi, West China (Fig6g)
Likewise, neither the Yangtze Block nor the Dabie Orogen could have been the main source for the Triassic–Jurassic sandstonesAlthough increasing evidence shows that Palaeoproterozoic rocks and inherited zircons are present in the Yangtze Block and Dabie Orogen (e.g
Thus, sediments sourced from the Yangtze Block and the Dabie Orogen would be dominated by Neoproterozoic grains, as shown in Figure 6f and hConsequently, the distinct age patterns of the Early Mesozoic sedimentary rocks, along with their Hf isotopic characteristics (Fig
Consequently, the distinct age patterns of the Early Mesozoic sedimentary rocks, along with their Hf isotopic characteristics (Fig5), rule out a main derivation from the Yangtze Block and the Dabie Orogen.
Thus, based on the following arguments, we propose that the eastern Cathaysia Block was the major source area of the Late Triassic–Early Jurassic clastic sedimentary rocks in South ChinaFirst, this interpretation is strongly supported by the observed westerly and northwesterly palaeocurrents (Figs 1 and 2)
As is shown in Figure 6, the Palaeoproterozoic population predominates over other Precambrian groups in the eastern regions (Daedong, Wenbinshan, Pingle and Yueshan), whereas Neoarchaean and Neoproterozoic grains become increasingly abundant toward the west (from Jianghan to Sichuan and to Songpan–Ganzi)Lastly, U–Pb age patterns and Hf isotope systematics of the detrital zircons are consistent with those of basement rocks of the eastern Cathaysia Block (Figs 5 and 6j)
Although the present remains of the Palaeoproterozoic crust are limited in Cathaysia, a much larger Precambrian block might have existed in the Early Mesozoic.Provenance of the other populations
The 850–700 Ma group of zircons is correlated with the widespread Neoproterozoic granitic gneisses and granitoids within and around the Yangtze BlockThe 480–370 Ma zircons were probably derived from Palaeozoic granitoids in the Qinling–Dabie Orogen (e.g
The 250– 210 Ma zircons correspond to the Triassic granitoids that crop out in the Cathaysia Block and along the eastern margin of the YangtzeFig
Zircons of the same ages also occur in Jurassic sedimentary rocks of the Hefei Basin, which lies north of the Dabie Orogen (Li et al2005), and in low-grade metamorphic rocks of the northern Dabie Terrane (Chen et al
In the South China Craton, ‘Indosinian-aged’ (Triassic) tectonism and associated magmatism have long been recognized and generally thought to be related to continental collisions between the Indochina, South China and North China blocks (e.gWang et al

As documented by detrital zircon geochronology and palaeocurrent data, the Triassic–Jurassic sediments around the South China Craton show remarkable similarities in provenance signaturesThis east–west-trending sedimentary zone extends from the western Korean Peninsula to West China and was fed by the same source in the Cathaysia Block
Considering a palaeogeographical framework characterized by topographic highs in the east and lows in the west (Wang 1985), we hypothesize that a westward-draining transcontinental palaeoriver system probably had existed along the northern margin of the Yangtze Block since the Middle TriassicThis is further supported by the spatial variation of lithofacies from alluvial fan deposits in western Korean Peninsula (Egawa & Lee 2009) to fluvial sandstones in the Pingle, Yueshan and Jianghan basins and to turbidites in the Songpan–Ganzi remnant ocean basin (Zhou & Graham 1996).
The Early Mesozoic Palaeoriver might have shed detritus from headwaters in the east through the Yueshan, Jianghan and Sichuan basins to the Songpan–Ganzi Basin, which is c2000 km to the west (Fig
7), a distance comparable with that of the proposed Jurassic transcontinental palaeodrainage network in North America (Dickinson & Gehrels 2009)A southwesterly flowing tributary might also have developed between the coastal orogen in Cathaysia and the uplifted Jiangnan Orogen, feeding the basins in Pingle and Wenbinshan since the Late Triassic
A southwesterly flowing tributary might also have developed between the coastal orogen in Cathaysia and the uplifted Jiangnan Orogen, feeding the basins in Pingle and Wenbinshan since the Late TriassicThis drainage system was then modified by the uplifting of the Qinling–Dabie Orogen to the north and the Longmenshan belt to the west in the late Triassic, giving rise to the Sichuan intracontinental basin (Fig
This drainage system was then modified by the uplifting of the Qinling–Dabie Orogen to the north and the Longmenshan belt to the west in the late Triassic, giving rise to the Sichuan intracontinental basin (Fig7).
Detrital zircon geochronology of the Early Mesozoic fluvial–lacustrine sediments from the Pingle, Jianghan and Sichuan basins of the South China Craton yielded major populations at 2.0–1.7 Ga, 2.6– 2.4 Ga, 850–700 Ma and 480–210 Ma, among which the first is dominantMost of the Palaeoproterozoic zircons have negative εHf(t) values and Hf continental crust model ages between 3.0 and 2.5 Ga
The Triassic–Jurassic sediments around the South China Craton show remarkable similarities in provenance signatures, revealing a syntectonic sedimentary zone extending from Korea to West China that probably developed in response to the subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific PlateIt is proposed that a westward-draining transcontinental palaeoriver system probably had existed across the Yangtze Block since the Middle Triassic, which might have originated from the eastern Cathaysia Block and shed detritus through the Yueshan, Jianghan and Sichuan basins to the Songpan–Ganzi Basin.
