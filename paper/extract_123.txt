Abstract: Avalonia is the largest accreted crustal block in the Appalachian orogen and comprises a collection of late Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary sequences that are overlain by a Palaeozoic platformal sedimentary successionDetrital zircons from the Conception Group are dominated by 570–620 Ma ages and contain a significant component generated by erosion of coeval igneous arc-volcanic rocks

palaeotectonic evolution of the major Neoproterozoic–early Palaeozoic continents.Despite its low abundance in sediments and sedimentary rocks, zircon is a common detrital constituent in many sedimentary rocks because it occurs in a wide spectrum of igneous rock types and is one of the few primary igneous minerals that can survive the highest grades of metamorphism and partial melting, as well as erosion, transportation, deposition and diagenesis, and thus can survive in the crust almost indefinitely (Mezger & Kro¨gstad 1997).

The general evolution of Avalonia indicates a protracted and episodic geological history of tectonomagmatic and depositional events that define a four-phase succession comprising: (1) early phases of arc- and rift-related magmatism between 760 and 670 Ma; (2) a main phase (635–570 Ma) of arc volcanism with coeval sedimentary succession dominated by volcanogenic turbidites and cogenetic plutons; (3) rift-related intracontinental volcanism and interlayered clastic sedimentation that records the transition from an arc to a platform without collision between 570 and 545 Ma; (4) deposition of a Cambrian–Ordovician shale-rich platformal sedimentary succession (Nance et al2002).

Although Laurentia and Baltica have comparable geological histories during the Proterozoic, which suggest evolution as a single cratonic nucleus following the amalgamation of Archaean cratons between 1.8 and 1.9 Ga (Hoffman 1988; Gower et al1990), geological, lithological, faunal, palaeomagnetic and isotopic evidence indicates that Avalonia is a distinct terrane exotic to Laurentia (Williams 1964; Murphy & Nance 1989; Hibbard et al

The detrital zircon data also refute an eastern Laurentian–Baltica source because the analysed rocks in Avalonia contain zircons with ages of 2.0–2.4 Ga and 620–750 Ma, which correspond to major Palaeoproterozoic (2.0–2.4 Ga) and Neoproterozoic tectonic and crust-forming events that are noticeably absent from the geological record of eastern Laurentian and Baltica (Gower et al1990; Wardle et al
