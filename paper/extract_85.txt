The presence of two west-facing Paleozoic platform successions along much of the length of the Cordillera, the Rocky Mountain and Cassiar platforms in Canada and the Antler and North American platforms in the United States, that have different geological histories and faunal assemblages (Johnston and Borel, 2007; Johnston, 2008; Hildebrand, 2009) indicates that they were separated by a broad ocean basin during the Paleozoic (Johnston and Borel, 2007; Johnston, 2008).

In the general accretionary model, western Neoproterozoic to Cambrian units (McNaughton, Hamill, Three Sisters, Quartzite Range, Geertsen Canyon, Prospect Mountain, and Wood Canyon formations), which compose the base of the Paleozoic succession of the Cassiar-Antler platform, represent distal equivalents of easterly units (Gog, Flathead, Tintic, Sawatch, Ignacio, Bliss, and Tapeats formations) deposited as part of the North American platform

Although the western units are somewhat older (latest Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian) than eastern units (middle to upper Cambrian), the general accretionary model predicts that rocks of the Cassiar-Antler platform were proximal to Laurentia in the Cambrian and, as such, may have had access to similar provenance areas in Laurentia and therefore may contain similar detrital zircon facies.

Substance: similar detrital zircon facies

Key words: ribbon continent model predicts, western units, Johnston, Hildebrand, similar source areas, Cambrian

Furthermore, the ribbon continent model stipulates that significant late Cretaceous to Cenozoic dextral translation of western Cassiar-Antler platform relative to North America occurred prior to final docking in the early Cenozoic (e.g., Hildebrand, 2015; Sigloch and Mihalynuk, 2013)

If the crust of the ribbon continent were a sliver rifted away from Laurentia in the Cambrian (Johnston, 2001), rocks of the Cassiar-Antler platform and the North American platform could have had access to similar-aged source areas and could, therefore, exhibit a similar geographic distribution of detrital zircon facies

Substance: similar geographic distribution, detrital zircon facies
