Similarities in Hf isotopic patterns for Cambrian–Ordovician through Middle Devonian strata in the Banks Island assemblage and the Saint Elias Mountains are striking and raise the possibility that the Banks Island assemblage was originally located adjacent to the northern portion of the Alexander terraneApproximately 1000 km of sinistral displacement is needed to bring the Banks Island assemblage adjacent to the southern portion of the terrane—some of this displacement may have occurred along the Kitkatla shear zone, which is known to have experienced sinistral displacement during Early Cretaceous time (Butler et al., 2006; Chardon et al., 1999).

We postulate that this tectonism may have been related to mid-Jurassic deformation recorded within the Alexander terrane (e.g., McClelland and Gehrels, 1990) and inferred to exist during generation of the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous plutons that intrude the Banks Island assemblage (Girardi et al., 2012).Finally, our sample “Absalom” records accumulation of plutonic-clast conglomerate during Early Cretaceous time
