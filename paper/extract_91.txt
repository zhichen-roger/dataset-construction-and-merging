A number of authors have published sand presence/absence and approximate thickness maps for the Paleocene turbiditic sands of the Central North Sea based on biostratigraphic and sequence stratigraphic intervals and associated well data (Stewart 1987; Kulpecz & Van Guens 1990; Knox & Holloway 1992; Den Hartog Jager et al1993; Vining et al

The major control on these trends is the relict Mesozoic graben structure with the major lineaments and intra-basinal horsts defining the sediment distribution (e.gO’Connor & Walker 1993; Mudge & Bujak 1996a; Hempton et al

The need for a greater understanding of the Mey Sandstone Member has increased with the desire to explore for North Sea hydrocarbons in subtle stratigraphic traps and with the ongoing discussion over what these cycles can reveal concerning shelfal sorting and storage processes and timing of hinterland uplift during the Paleogene (cfSele cycle analysis of Den Hartog Jager et al

It has been proposed that relative sea-level changes are the main control on sediment routing from the shelf to the basin during the Paleogene, with turbidites being deposited in the main lowstands (Den Hartog Jager et al1993; Neal 1996; White & Lovell 1997; Jennette et al

Secondly, the control of relative sea-level changes on the Paleogene sequences can be further elucidatedAlthough these have been recognized previously, assumptions have been made, based mainly on the Sele Formation (e.g

This paper presents an integrated model of the spatial extent of the Paleocene Mey Sandstone Member within the Lista Formation of the Central North SeaDetailed mapping from seismic data, wells and core examples allows distinct axial and lateral fairways of turbidite flows to be defined which show distinct similarities and differences with the distribution of sandstones within the overlying Sele Formation

These main depositional fairways (with thick proximal areas in the NW and thin distal areas towards the SE) appear to have been controlled predominantly by the bathymetry of the seafloor which, in turn, is defined by the relict Mesozoic graben structureDetailed maps and correlation panels are presented, which show that the intra-Lista turbidite cycles deposited material in a prograding nature before a late episode of backstepping

Finally, although the deep-water deposits of the North Sea Paleogene have often been described as basin-floor submarine fans, it should be noted that this is an atypical system with considerable modification provided by the underlying topography and with multiple sediment entry points.This work was compiled as part of the PhD project of Ben Kilhams, which is focused on the Maureen and Lista Formations of the Central North Sea and sponsored by Shell Upstream International (UI) Europe
