Lu–Hf isotopic study of detrital zircons from Cretaceous– Palaeogene sandstones recovered by coring at two sites, one on Hatton Bank (British Geological Survey (BGS) borehole 99/2A) and one close to Edoras Bank (Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Site 555), and discuss their implications for the age of the basement underlying these two poorly understood areas.Zircon concentrates were obtained using standard density and magnetic separation techniques

Beneath a Miocene deep-water biogenic pelagic succession, the borehole encountered a Palaeocene–Eocene succession dominated by basalt flows and volcaniclastic sediment, with occasional units containing terrigenous clastic sediments (Shipboard Scientific Party 1984)This volcanic-dominated succession was generated during the early stages of sea-floor spreading between Rockall Plateau and Greenland, and is coeval with the seawarddipping reflector sequence found to the SW of Edoras Bank (Roberts et al

There is a single very early Palaeoproterozoic grain with a large error bar (2477  68 Ma), a discordant grain dated at 1971  89 Ma, a small number of grains slightly younger than the main peak (ranging to 1605 Ma), and two late Mesoproterozoic grains (1003 Ma, 1112 Ma)As with the sample from borehole 99/2A, all the zircons in the sample have relatively high Th/U, implying an igneous parentage of felsic–intermediate composition.

The zircon age data from Hatton and Edoras banks suggest that, following the creation of the Palaeoproterozoic crustal block, the area remained comparatively undisturbed by tectonothermal events until rifting took place during the Mesozoic and Palaeocene, leading to continental break-up and subsequent sea-floor spreading in the Early EoceneHowever, the data may have some significance regarding the location of the Grenville Front
