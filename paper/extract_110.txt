A maximum depositional age (MDA) of 136 Ma demonstrates that the Liberty Creek schist was deposited long after the Early Jurassic cooling ages (196–185 Ma) recorded in other western Alaskan schist bodies containing blueschist-facies rocks, thus revealing two distinct blueschist-facies preservation events: an Early Jurassic event and a post–Early Cretaceous eventThis Early Cretaceous depositional age also indicates that there have been major reorganizations within this subduction complex because the Potter Creek assemblage (MDA of 169–156 Ma), directly south of the Liberty Creek schist, is an older but more shallowly exhumed assemblage

Based on this detrital signature and similar conclusions from other authors (e.g., Umhoefer, 2003; Garver and Davidson, 2015; Hildebrand, 2015; Shaw and Johnston, 2016), we speculate that long-distance northward transport of terranes in the North American Cordillera during Late Cretaceous to Paleogene time was responsible for the current geographic location of the Liberty Creek schist, both along the paleomargin and among other terranes of this accretionary complex.Blueschist-facies rocks along the northernmost Cordilleran margin have been interpreted as exhumed products of a subduction zone with a similar polarity to the present-day margin (e.g., Carden et al., 1977; Forbes et

Throughout the Mesozoic, the northern Cordillera was characterized by the accretion of arc systems and subsequent strike-slip dispersal of elements of these arc-trench systems, leading to the observed terrane mosaic of the modern margin (Plafker et al., 1994).The outer Cordilleran assemblage is composed of an accreted arc–trench system, with the Wrangellia composite terrane representing the arc assemblage and the “Chugach terrane” representing the subduction complex (Fig

This arc terrane is either a younger separate oceanic arc that was amalgamated with Wrangellia as recently as Late Jurassic time (Clift et al., 2005), or it was constructed upon the combined Wrangellia-Alexander terrane by Late Jurassic time, when a cover sequence firmly establishes connections between these terranes (e.g., Coney et al., 1980; Plafker et al., 1994; Trop et al., 2002, 2005)The backstop to the subduction complex is the

Based on cooling ages as old as the earliest Jurassic and structural position, these blueschist-facies rocks are widely cited as evidence for the initiation of subduction and the earliest accretion of the Chugach accretionary complex (e.g., Plafker et al., 1994; Pavlis and Roeske, 2007)Detrital zircons from the other members of the Chugach accretionary complex, however, are much younger than the available blueschist-facies cooling ages (Amato et al., 2013)

This observation, together with relationships in the adjacent arc on the Wrangellia composite terrane, is the principal evidence that a prolonged period of subduction erosion followed Early Jurassic accretion of the blueschist-facies rocks (Clift et al., 2005; Amato and Pavlis, 2010).The source of the clastic rocks that formed the protolith to the Potter Creek assemblage was the Early to Middle Jurassic Talkeetna-Bonanza arc or another coeval mid-Jurassic arc on the Wrangellia composite terrane, but the Potter Creek clastic rocks are mixed with pelagic to hemipelagic rocks that include radiolarian cherts with a wide range of depositional ages (e.g., Plafker et al., 1994; Amato et al., 2013)
