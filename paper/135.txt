Cenomanian—Early Turonian carbonate platform of Northern Oman: stratigraphy and palaeo-environments
The Jebel Akhdar and Adam foothills outcrops in northern Oman (Arabian Peninsula) offer the opportunity to study in detail the lateral and vertical changes of a Cenomanian—Early Turonian carbonate platform formed by the Natih Formation (Wasia Group)
Typical Cenomanian rudist association (caprinids and radiolitids) occur in the Natih e—c—d—a (lower part) whereas lower Turonian hippuritid rudists are represented in the upper part of the Natih a.
The Natih Formation represents the last Tethyan carbonate system developed during the Permian Turonian interval on the Arabian Platform (Murris, 1980)
Extensive biostratigraphic studies on foraminifera (Simmons and Hart, 1987), echinoids (Smith et al., 1990) and ammonites ( Kennedy and Simmons, 1991 have established the Cenomanian age of the Natih Formation
A great diversity is observed in the lower part where the genera Radiolites, Praeradiolites, Eoradiolites, Sauvagesia, Apricardia, Distefanella have been observed At the top of the unit (just beneath the hard-ground), a typical late Cenomanian association was observed (Sauvagesia cf
Based on the discovery of a fragment of Vascoceras at the base of the Lower Member, Rabu assigned the Fitri unit to the Lower Turonian.
Both on the southern flank of the Jebel Akhdar and in the Oman foothills, the praealveolinid, radiolitid and caprinid limestones of the Natih overlie the hemipelagic facies of the Fitri, thus attesting to its Cenomanian age.
T homel ) index ammonite of the Middle Cenomanian.
Its age straddles the Middle—Late Cenomanian
According to Scott (1990), the Natih f—g can be assigned to the Early Cenomanian, and the Albian—Cenomanian boundary correlates approximatively with the Uppermost Nahr Umr and basal Natih
All the authors who have studied the micropalaeontological content of the Natih (Simmons and Hart, 1987; Smith et al., 1990; Scott, 1990) attributed the lower part of the Member e to the Lower Cenomanian; the rudist association (Sphaerulites, Praeradiolites, Eoradiolites, Ichthyosarcolit/les) supports this interpretation
( 1990) have clearly demonstrated the overlap of orbitolinids and alveolinids in the upper part of the Member e, which indicates a Middle Cenomanian age
In the type section of Wadi Mi'Aidin, the Lower Cenomanian/Middle Cenomanian boundary can therefore be placed at bed 1365 which corresponds to the first appearance of praealveolinids (Fig
The position of the Middle Cenomanian/Upper Cenomanian boundary is still debated

In the Wadi Mi'Aidin section, the Middle Cenomanian/Late Cenomanian boundary lies within the upper part of the third praealveolinid—radiolitid unit = Member b characterized by the co-occurrence of praealveolinids, Orbitolinella depressa Henson, and Eoradiolites.
The Natih a has generally been attributed to the Late Cenomanian—Lowermost Turonian
Ammonites (Kennedy and Simmons, 1991) and planktonic foraminifera (Scott, 1990; Kennedy and Simmons, 1991) have been used to place the Cenomanian—Turonian boundary in the upper part of Natih a, where this unit consists of basinal facies (e.g
In the carbonate platform area, rudists can be used to characterize the Late Cenomanian and the Early Turonian
The Late Cenomanian rudist association is formed by Sauvagesia sharpei, Durania arnaudi, Caprinula sp
and the Early Turonian is characterized by the first appearance of hippuritids (Figs
Thus, we propose Wadi Nakhr as the reference section of the Cenomanian—Turonian boundary in carbonate platform facies in Oman.
7A) and Wadi Al Hamra in the upper part of Natih a of earliest Turonian age
The arrow indicates the location of the Hippuritid beds (Lowermost Turonian)
It probably represents relative uplift of the Natih platform with erosion (and local emersion?), followed by a transitional (Turonian) or abrupt (Santonian) deepening linked with the formation of the Muti intrashelf basin (Robertson, 1987).
This unit straddles the Lower Cenomanian/Middle Cenomanian boundary.
This overall trend and specially the onlap of more basinal facies on the Natih East platform could be related to an initial phase of tectonic loading announcing the creation of the North Oman fore deep (Muti) during the Turonian.
The shallow marine carbonates of the Natih f—g can be considered to be the upper part of the marine transgression (T.S.T.) that led to the formation of an extensive mixed carbonate siliciclastic shelf over the exposed Aptian Shuaiba platform (Murris, 1980).
The Natih e represents the highstand system tract of the Lower Cenomanian—Middle Cenomanian cycle (cycle 2.3 of the global chart of Haq et al., 1988)
But, with reference to global Tethyan evolution, a good link can be found between the emersive surface top of the Natih e, and the Middle Cenomanian regressive event known in most regions of the Tethys domain
The cause of this event is not clearly explained, but the midCenomanian regression is well documented by Hancock ( 1989) in the British region.
This second cycle fits with the Upper Cenomanian—Lowermost Turonian of the global curve (cycle 2.5).
The transgressive cycle of the Upper Natih probably has an eustatic origin reflecting the global transgression which characterized the Late Cenomanian all around the Tethyan domain (Philip and Airaud-Crumiére, 1991)
Its upper part corresponds to the highstand system-tract of the Lower Cenomanian—Middle Cenomanian cycle and displays shallowing upward parasequences.
of the transgressive interval of the Middle—Late Cenomanian—Early Turonian cycle
The Natih a was developed when terrigenous input ceased and during the maximum transgressive Late Cenomanian--Early Turonian episode
It was interrupted by a major environmental crisis, at the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary which affected all Cenomanian carbonate platforms around the Tethys realm (Philip and CrumiéreAiraud, 1991 ) and enhanced in Oman by a tectonic regional event (Robertson, 1987).
The Natih outcrops of the Jebel Akhdar and the foot hills in northern Oman allow the establishment of a detailed stratigraphical model of a Cenomanian- Early Turonian carbonate platform which contributes to major oil production in Oman
In this respect, an Early Turonian age is proposed for the Upper part of the Natih a which contains the first hippuritid rudists
The overall evolution of the platform system fits the global trends recorded around the Tethys, such as the Middle Cenomanian exposure, the Late Cenomanian/Early Turonian anoxic event, and the termination by exposure and/or drowning of the carbonate system during the Early Turonian
Changes of global and local palaeoenvironmental conditions during the Cenomanian/Early Turonian, have contributed to the changing physiognomy of the Natih carbonate platform, its biozonation, and the resulting facies.
