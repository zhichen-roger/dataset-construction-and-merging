Most 1.50–1.65 Ga zircons have positive εHf(t) values (+1.2 to +9.0), and most 1.70–1.80 Ga zircons have negative εHf(t) values (−7.1 to −1.9), which are compatible with those of the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic orthogneisses in the Namche Barwa ComplexProvenance analysis indicates that the southern Indian Shield, South Lhasa terrane and probably Eastern Antarctica were the potential detrital sources
Combined with previous studies, our results suggest that: (1) the Namche Barwa Complex is the northeastern extension of the Greater Himalaya Sequence; (2) the metasedimentary rocks in the Namche Barwa Complex represent distal deposits of the northern Indian margin relative to the Lesser Himalaya; (3) the South Lhasa terrane was tectonically linked to northern India before the Cambrian.© 2015 International Association for Gondwana Research
The Himalaya-Tibetan orogen was built upon a complex tectonic collage resulting from several continental collision events since the Early Paleozoic (Allègre et al., 1984; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Zhu et al., 2013)From north to south, it consists of the Kunlun–Qaidam, Songpan–Ganzi, Qiangtang, Lhasa terranes and Himalaya (Fig
Reconstruction of the Neoproterozoic–Paleozoic paleogeography for different terranes, such as the Himalaya, Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes, is therefore of critical importance to our understanding of the formation and evolution of the Himalaya-Tibetan orogen (Allègre et al., 1984; DeCelles et al., 2000; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Myrow et al., 2003;Gehrels et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011a, 2013; Zhang et al., 2012a, 2014; McQuarrie et al., 2013).
The Lhasa terrane can be divided into the South and North Lhasa terranes by the Permian North Gangdese suture (Fig1b) (Yang et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2014)
The evidence supporting the Australian affinity is that detrital zircon age spectra of Carboniferous– Permian sedimentary rocks in the North Lhasa terrane are similar to those of Northwest Australia, but different from those of Tethyan1342-937X/© 2015 International Association for Gondwana Research
(2015)), showing the locations of the studied samples and Paleoproterozoic–Neoproterozoic magmatic/metamorphic rocks (Lin et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013b).Himalaya (Zhu et al., 2011a, 2013)
The similar detrital zircon U–Pb age spectra, trace-element signatures and Hf isotopic compositions between the Namche Barwa Complex and Nyingchi Complex indicate that their sedimentary protoliths were derived from common provenance, and that the South Lhasa terrane was linked to the northern Indian plate before the Cambrian.The Himalayan orogenic belt is separated from the Lhasa terrane by Indus–Tsangpo suture (Fig
The LHS can be further subdivided into lower LHS and upper LHS by an unconformity between Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic (McQuarrie et al., 2008, 2013; Kohn et al., 2010; Long et al., 2011)The lower LHS consists of Late Paleoproterozoic to the earliest Mesoproterozoic metasedimentary strata with small volume of igneous rocks, and the upper LHS consists of Late Mesoproterozoic–Early Neoproterozoic to Cambrian strata (DeCelles et al., 2000; Yin, 2006; McQuarrie et al., 2008, 2013; Kohn et al., 2010; Myrow et al., 2010; Long et al., 2011; McKenzie et al., 2011)
The lower LHS consists of Late Paleoproterozoic to the earliest Mesoproterozoic metasedimentary strata with small volume of igneous rocks, and the upper LHS consists of Late Mesoproterozoic–Early Neoproterozoic to Cambrian strata (DeCelles et al., 2000; Yin, 2006; McQuarrie et al., 2008, 2013; Kohn et al., 2010; Myrow et al., 2010; Long et al., 2011; McKenzie et al., 2011)The GHS is mainly composed of Neoproterozoic–Paleozoic strata, which were intruded by Cambrian–Ordovician granitoids and Miocene leucogranites (DeCelles et al., 2000; Myrow et al., 2010; Yin, 2006, and references therein)
The GHS is mainly composed of Neoproterozoic–Paleozoic strata, which were intruded by Cambrian–Ordovician granitoids and Miocene leucogranites (DeCelles et al., 2000; Myrow et al., 2010; Yin, 2006, and references therein)The THS consists of Proterozoic to Eocene siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks interbedded with Paleozoic and Mesozoic volcanic rocks (Brookfield, 1993; Myrow et al., 2003; Yin, 2006, and references therein).
The THS consists of Proterozoic to Eocene siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks interbedded with Paleozoic and Mesozoic volcanic rocks (Brookfield, 1993; Myrow et al., 2003; Yin, 2006, and references therein).The Lhasa terrane is separated from the Qiangtang terrane to the north by the Bangong–Nujiang suture zone and from the Tethyan Himalaya to the south by the Indus–Tsangpo suture zone (Fig
1b) by the Permian–Triassic North Gangdese suture zone (Yang et al., 2009)The North Lhasa terrane is underlain by a Proterozoic–Archean crystalline basement (Zhu et al., 2011b, 2013) that experienced multiple episodes of metamorphic overprinting and magmatism from Neoproterozoic to Cenozoic times (Xu et al., 1985; Hu et al., 2005; Kapp et al., 2005; Dong et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2012a; Zhang et al., 2012a, 2014)
The North Lhasa terrane is underlain by a Proterozoic–Archean crystalline basement (Zhu et al., 2011b, 2013) that experienced multiple episodes of metamorphic overprinting and magmatism from Neoproterozoic to Cenozoic times (Xu et al., 1985; Hu et al., 2005; Kapp et al., 2005; Dong et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2012a; Zhang et al., 2012a, 2014)This crystalline basement is covered by Permo-Carboniferous and Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous strata and volcanic rocks, and minor Cambrian–Devonian and Triassic strata (Zhu et al., 2012a)
This crystalline basement is covered by Permo-Carboniferous and Upper Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous strata and volcanic rocks, and minor Cambrian–Devonian and Triassic strata (Zhu et al., 2012a)The South Lhasa terrane is dominated by the Jurassic– Neogene Gangdese batholith and Linzizong volcanic succession (Coulon et al., 1986; Chu et al., 2006; Wen et al., 2008; Ji et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011b; Pan et al., 2014)
The South Lhasa terrane is dominated by the Jurassic– Neogene Gangdese batholith and Linzizong volcanic succession (Coulon et al., 1986; Chu et al., 2006; Wen et al., 2008; Ji et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011b; Pan et al., 2014)Its metamorphic basement is exposed in the eastern part of the South Lhasa terrane (Zhang et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013b).
The South Lhasa terrane consists of the high-grade Nyingchi Complex and Bome Complex, Paleozoic–Mesozoic strata and Mesozoic–Cenozoic granitoids (Booth et al., 2009; Burg et al., 1997; Geng et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2011, 2012, 2013; Xu et al., 2013a,b; Zhang et al., 2008, 2010a)The Nyingchi Complex is composed of orthogneiss, paragneiss, amphibolite, marble, schist, quartzite, migmatite, and minor granulites (Geng et al., 2006; Booth et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Dong et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010b, 2013, 2014; Guo et al., 2011, 2012, 2013)
Both the Nyingchi and Bome Complexes were previously considered to be the Precambrian metamorphic basement of the Lhasa terrane based on their middle- and high-grade metamorphism (Geng et al., 2006)However, recent studies show that they experienced multiple episodes of metamorphism from Late Mesoproterozoic, Late Neoproterozoic, Late Cretaceous to Miocene (Booth et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Dong et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010b, 2013, 2014; Guo et al., 2012, 2013; Lin et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013a)
However, recent studies show that they experienced multiple episodes of metamorphism from Late Mesoproterozoic, Late Neoproterozoic, Late Cretaceous to Miocene (Booth et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Dong et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010b, 2013, 2014; Guo et al., 2012, 2013; Lin et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013a)Detrital zircon geochronological studies revealed that the metasedimentary rocks have various depositional ages ranging from Paleozoic to Cenozoic (Zhang et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2012, 2013; Zhang and Wu, 2012; Xu et al., 2013a)
Detrital zircon geochronological studies revealed that the metasedimentary rocks have various depositional ages ranging from Paleozoic to Cenozoic (Zhang et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2012, 2013; Zhang and Wu, 2012; Xu et al., 2013a)In this study, we report that the Nyingchi Complex contains N499 Ma sedimentary rock
The orthogneisses have protolith crystallization ages ranging from Paleoproterozoic (~1782 Ma), Cambrian (~496 Ma), Late Devonian–Carboniferous (367–345 Ma), Jurassic (~165 Ma), and Cretaceous to Eocene (Dong et al., 2010, 2014; Guo et al., 2011, 2012, 2013; Ji et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013, 2014).The northeastern Indian plate consists of THS and GHS (Fig
The THS consists of Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary strata which experienced greenschist- to amphibolite-facies metamorphism (Booth et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2012b)The GHS, referred to as the Namche Barwa Complex, consists of orthogneiss, paragneiss, marble, schist, quartzite, granulite, and migmatite (Ding et al., 2001; Geng et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007, 2011; Guo et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2010, 2012; Zhang et al., 2010b, 2012b, 2015)
For comparison, the Paleoproterozoic–Mesoproterozoic orthogneisses from the Bome Complex and theNamche Barwa Complex (NBC) in the Eastern Himalayan syntaxis (this study; Xu et al., 2013b), and 1.1–2.8 Ga igneous rocks from Albany–Fraser orogen in southwest Australia (Smits et al., 2014, and references therein) are also plotted.
Mesoproterozoic orthogneiss from the Namche Barwa ComplexThree orthogneiss samples T614, T610, and T616 from the Namche Barwa Complex have protolith crystallization ages of 1759 ± 10 Ma, 1594 ± 13 Ma, and 1583 ± 6 Ma (Guo et al., 2008), respectively
Previous detrital zircon U–Pb geochronological studies revealed that the metasedimentary rocks from the Nyingchi Complex had maximum depositional ages ranging from Cambrian, through Carboniferous, to Paleogene (Zhang et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2012; Zhang and Wu, 2012)Compared with the Paleozoic strata from the Lhasa terrane (Zhang et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2010; Gehrels et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011b; Guo et al., 2012; Zhang and Wu, 2012), the absence of ~0.5–0.9 Ga detrital zircons indicates that the studied metasedimentary rocks from the Nyingchi Complex probably have protolith ages of Late Mesoproterozoic–Early Neoproterozoic.
Compared with the Paleozoic strata from the Lhasa terrane (Zhang et al., 2008; Dong et al., 2010; Gehrels et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011b; Guo et al., 2012; Zhang and Wu, 2012), the absence of ~0.5–0.9 Ga detrital zircons indicates that the studied metasedimentary rocks from the Nyingchi Complex probably have protolith ages of Late Mesoproterozoic–Early Neoproterozoic.5.1.2
In addition, the ~0.5–0.9 Ga detrital zircons are abundant in Cryogenian and younger strata throughout the Himalaya (Gehrels et al., 2011; Hofmann et al., 2011; McKenzie et al., 2011)By contrast, detrital zircon age populations of ~0.5–0.9 Ga are absent in our metasedimentary rock samples (Fig
We propose that their sedimentary protoliths likely have Early Neoproterozoic depositional ageThe Nyingchi Complex and the Namche Barwa Complex show consistent age spectra and the high P values (0.289–0.821) of K–S test (Table 1) suggest that they probably have similar depositional ages.
This speculation is supported by that the Namche Barwa Complex and GHS have similar Paleoproterozoic crystallization basement that extend from South Tibet, Bhutan, to Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis (also see next section) (Guo et al., 2008; Liao et al., 2008; Chakungal et al., 2010; Kohn et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012b).5.3
Previous studies suggested that the GHS and THS can be distinguished from the LHS by Sr–Nd–Hf isotopic and detrital zircon geochronological differences, with the GHS and THS yielding less negative εNd values and containing abundant Neoproterozoic–Paleozoic (~1.0 Ga and ~0.5 Ga) detrital zircon, whereas the LHS yielding more negative εNd values and containing no detrital zircon younger than 1.6 Ga (Parrish and Hodges, 1996; Ahmad et al., 2000; DeCelles et al., 2000; Argles et al., 2003; Richards et al., 2005, 2006; Mottram et al., 2014)On the basis of these isotopic differences, the GHS was interpreted as an accreted terrane tectonically consolidated with the Greater India during early Paleozoic time (DeCelles et al., 2000; Gehrels et al., 2003) or as distal and proximal basins on the Indian margin (Myrow et al., 2003, 2010; McQuarrie et al., 2008, 2013; Yin et al., 2010a; Long et al., 2011; McKenzie et al., 2011; Webb et al., 2013; Mottram et al., 2014).
On the basis of these isotopic differences, the GHS was interpreted as an accreted terrane tectonically consolidated with the Greater India during early Paleozoic time (DeCelles et al., 2000; Gehrels et al., 2003) or as distal and proximal basins on the Indian margin (Myrow et al., 2003, 2010; McQuarrie et al., 2008, 2013; Yin et al., 2010a; Long et al., 2011; McKenzie et al., 2011; Webb et al., 2013; Mottram et al., 2014).In the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis, detrital zircon age spectra of the quartzites from the Namche Barwa Complex are remarkably similar to those of the coeval rocks in the upper LHS in Arunachal (Yin et al., 2006) and cratonic successions (Alwar Group, Ganga Group, the upper Vindhyan Group, and Shillong Group) in northern India (Malone et al., 2008; McKenzie et al., 2011, 2013; Turner et al., 2014) (Fig
(Guo et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2012b), which are comparable with the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic orthogneisses from the GHS and LHS in Arunachal and NE Indian craton (Ameen et al., 2007; Yin et al., 2010a, b), suggesting that these areas share the same crystalline basement that belongs to the Indian cratonTherefore, we propose that the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic orthogneisses in the Namche Barwa Complex represents the crystalline basement of the Indian craton, and the metasedimentary rocks represent the distal deposits along the continuous north Indian margin during Neoproterozoic–Cambrian.
Therefore, we propose that the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic orthogneisses in the Namche Barwa Complex represents the crystalline basement of the Indian craton, and the metasedimentary rocks represent the distal deposits along the continuous north Indian margin during Neoproterozoic–Cambrian.In this study, detrital zircons from the Namche Barwa Complex and Nyingchi Complex show similar age spectra, with major age populations of 1.00–1.20 Ga, 1.30–1.45 Ga, 1.50–1.65 Ga and 1.70–1.85 Ga (Fig
Previous studies considered that the 1.00–1.20 Ga zircon grains in the Neoproterozoic–Paleozoic strata from Himalayan units and Lhasa terrane (Fig9a) were most likely derived from the Wilkes–Albany–Fraser Orogen (WAFO) (Fig
10), where abundant Mesoproterozoic (1.3–1.5 Ga) alkalic and mafic magmatism formed in a rift tectonic setting (Upadhyay and Raith, 2006a, 2006b; Upadhyay et al., 2006a, 2006b; Vijaya Kumar et al., 2007; Upadhyay, 2008; Vijaya Kumar and Rathna, 2008; Ratre et al., 2010)In addition, Xu et al
The Mesoproterozoic (1.3–1.5 Ga) rift could be related to separation of India from east Antarctica corresponding to the breakup of Columbia supercontinent (Upadhyay, 2008, and references therein)Therefore, the 1.30–1.45 Ga detrital zircons most likely were derived from the southeastern India and South Lhasa terrane itself
In addition, the Rayner, Rauer, and Maud Provinces of Eastern Antarctica contain abundant Mesoproterozoic basement rocks (Myrow et al., 2010, and references therein), and thus could also be possible sources for the 1.00–1.20 Ga grains in our samplesTherefore, we considered that the 1.00–1.20 Ga grains were most likely derived from the Late Mesoproterozoic orogens (e.g., ADMB, CITZ and EGO) in southern Indian Shield, South Lhasa terrane, and probably Eastern Antarctica (Fig
Therefore, we considered that the 1.00–1.20 Ga grains were most likely derived from the Late Mesoproterozoic orogens (e.g., ADMB, CITZ and EGO) in southern Indian Shield, South Lhasa terrane, and probably Eastern Antarctica (Fig10).
The age populations of 1.50–1.65 Ga and 1.70–1.85 Ga are consistent with the crystallization ages of the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic orthogneisses in the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis, Bhutan and Arunachal Himalaya, NE India craton, and the CITZ (Ameen et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2008; Yin et al., 2010a; Bhowmik et al., 2011, 2012; Zhang et al., 2012b; Bora et al., 2013)The Hf isotopic compositions of the 1.50–1.65 Ga and 1.70–1.85 Ga detrital zircons also are comparable to those of the 1759– 1583 Ma orthogneisses in the Namche Barwa Complex (Fig
The minor Mesoarchean to Paleoproterozoic (3.0–2.0 Ga) zircon grains in our samples are consistent with the ages of magmatic rocks in the Dharwar craton (Fig10) (Dey, 2013).
(2013) reported two Paleoproterozoic (~1784 Ma and ~1782 Ma) orthogneisses from the Nyingchi Complex, which experienced granulite-facies metamorphism at ~1117 Ma and amphibolite-facies metamorphism at 618–604 MaThese orthogneisses are comparable with the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic (1.6–1.85 Ga) magmatic rocks in the Namche Barwa Complex, GHS, LHS, and northeastern Indian Craton (e.g., Ameen et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2008; Chakungal et al., 2010; Kohn et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2010a; Kaur et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012b), suggesting that the South Lhasa terrane has a similar Paleoproterozoic basement to that of the northeastern India
These orthogneisses are comparable with the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic (1.6–1.85 Ga) magmatic rocks in the Namche Barwa Complex, GHS, LHS, and northeastern Indian Craton (e.g., Ameen et al., 2007; Guo et al., 2008; Chakungal et al., 2010; Kohn et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2010a; Kaur et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2012b), suggesting that the South Lhasa terrane has a similar Paleoproterozoic basement to that of the northeastern IndiaBoth the South Lhasa terrane and the eastern proto-Indian margin experienced Mesoproterozoic (~1.3–1.5 Ga) continental rifting (Upadhyay, 2008, and references therein; Xu et al., 2013b)
Both the South Lhasa terrane and the eastern proto-Indian margin experienced Mesoproterozoic (~1.3–1.5 Ga) continental rifting (Upadhyay, 2008, and references therein; Xu et al., 2013b)The ~1117 Ma granulite-facies metamorphism is consistent with the 1.0– 1.2 Ga granulite-facies metamorphism in the EGO (Yin et al., 2010a; Lin et al., 2013)
The 618–604 Ma metamorphism and ~500 Ma magmatism correspond to the protracted Prydz orogenesis between the eastern India, northwest Australia, and northeast of East Antarctica during Late Neoproterozoic–Cambrian (600–500 Ma) (Fig10) (Dong et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013b; Yin et al., 2010a; this study)
Therefore, we suggest that the South Lhasa terrane and northern India were tectonically linked before Cambrian (Fig10).
(2011a) found that detrital zircons from Carboniferous– Permian metasedimentary rocks in the Lhasa terrane define a distinctive age population of ~1170 Ma (Fig9a), whereas those from THS define an age population of ~950 Ma
They considered that the ~1170 Ma detrital zircons were derived from the AFO in southwest Australia, and thus suggested that the Lhasa terrane was located adjacent to the Northwest Australia during the Late Precambrian–Early PaleozoicAccording to this paleogeographic scenario (Zhu et al., 2011a), the Carboniferous–Permian sedimentary rocks in Lhasa terrane should contain abundant Archean zircon grains because the river systems draining from AFO would pass through the Archean Yilgarn craton
According to this paleogeographic scenario (Zhu et al., 2011a), the Carboniferous–Permian sedimentary rocks in Lhasa terrane should contain abundant Archean zircon grains because the river systems draining from AFO would pass through the Archean Yilgarn cratonHowever, the Archean zircon population is insignificant in these sedimentary rocks (Fig
However, the Archean zircon population is insignificant in these sedimentary rocks (Fig9a), indicating the AFO source is unlikely
(in press) proposed that the Lhasa terrane was an isolated microcontinent within the Paleo-Tethys ocean basin during Carboniferous–PermianIf this is the case, Carboniferous–Permian sediments in North Lhasa terrane were mainly derived from the basement and pre-Carboniferous cover rocks in the Lhasa terrane instead of AFO.
If this is the case, Carboniferous–Permian sediments in North Lhasa terrane were mainly derived from the basement and pre-Carboniferous cover rocks in the Lhasa terrane instead of AFO.We suggest that the combined South and North Lhasa terranes were located in the northern Indian margin before Early Cambrian (Fig
We suggest that the combined South and North Lhasa terranes were located in the northern Indian margin before Early Cambrian (Fig10)
The sedimentary basins (Purana Basins, upper LHS, GHS and combined Lhasa terrane) in the northern Indian margin received sediment input from the Late Mesoproterozoic orogens in the Indian Shield before the Early Cambrian (Myrow et al., 2010; Yin et al., 2010b; McKenzie et al., 2011, 2013; McQuarrie et al., 2013), and thus contain abundant 1.0– 1.2 Ga detritus (Fig9)
During the Late Cambrian–Ordovician, the northern Indian margin switched from the open ocean environment to a north-facing active margin (Fig10) (Garzanti et al., 1986; Cawood et al., 2007; Gehrels et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2012b; McQuarrie et al., 2013; Ding et al., 2015)
After that, the northern Indian margin became a passive margin from Ordovician to the EoceneDuring this interval all of the cratonic rocks, including the Vindhyan, Alwar, Ganga, and Shillong Groups (Fig
During the Late Devonian–Early Carboniferous, the combined Lhasa terrane probably had rifted from the northern Indian margin and formed a microcontinent within the Paleo-Tethys ocean basin (Zhu et al., 2010, 2012b, 2013; Guo et al., in press)The 1.0–1.2 Ga detrital zircons in the Carboniferous–Permian strata from the Lhasa terrane were mainly recycled from the basement and pre-Carboniferous cover rocks in the Lhasa terrane.
The 1.0–1.2 Ga detrital zircons in the Carboniferous–Permian strata from the Lhasa terrane were mainly recycled from the basement and pre-Carboniferous cover rocks in the Lhasa terrane.In the Eastern Himalayan syntaxis, some metasedimentary rocks from the Nyingchi Complex in the South Lhasa terrane and the Namche Barwa Complex in the northeastern India have maximum depositional ages of ~1.0 Ga
This further indicates that the South Lhasa terrane was tectonically linked to northern India before Cambrian.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at
