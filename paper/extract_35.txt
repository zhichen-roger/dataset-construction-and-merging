During the Late Cretaceous to Eocene, the convergence rate between the Indian and Asian plates exceeded 10 cm/yr (e.g., Patriat and Achache, 1984; Klootwijk et al., 1992; Lee and Lawver, 1995)This convergence was coeval with northward subduction of Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere beneath southern Asia and the development of the Gangdese continental magmatic arc in southern Tibet (e.g., Schärer et al., 1984)
