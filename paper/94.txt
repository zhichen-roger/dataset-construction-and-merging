Detrital zircons from Cretaceous midcontinent strata reveal an Appalachian Mountains–Cordilleran foreland basin connectionEARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES DEPARTMENT, UNIVERSITY OF IOWA, IOWA CITY, IOWA 52242, USA
Cordilleran foreland basin during Albian–Cenomanian timeApproximately 78 percent of detrital zircon grains match the ages of Grenvillian (1.3–1.0 Ga), Pan-African (750–500 Ma), and Paleozoic (500–310 Ma) bedrock sources located within the present-day Appalachian Mountains
Approximately 78 percent of detrital zircon grains match the ages of Grenvillian (1.3–1.0 Ga), Pan-African (750–500 Ma), and Paleozoic (500–310 Ma) bedrock sources located within the present-day Appalachian MountainsThe presence of minor detrital zircon grains of Paleoproterozoic (2.5–1.5 Ga) or Archean age (>2.5 Ga) indicates that northern source regions in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Canada did not contribute a significant volume of sediment, as had been previously interpreted
The presence of minor detrital zircon grains of Paleoproterozoic (2.5–1.5 Ga) or Archean age (>2.5 Ga) indicates that northern source regions in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Canada did not contribute a significant volume of sediment, as had been previously interpretedBased on similarities between detrital zircon signatures in the midcontinent strata and time-equivalent Cordilleran foreland basin strata, Appalachian sources may have contributed a previously unrecognized volume of sediment to the Albian–Cenomanian foreland basin system
Based on similarities between detrital zircon signatures in the midcontinent strata and time-equivalent Cordilleran foreland basin strata, Appalachian sources may have contributed a previously unrecognized volume of sediment to the Albian–Cenomanian foreland basin systemSediment flux from the Appalachian region to the Cordilleran foreland basin during middle Cretaceous time may have been related to increased uplift and exhumation due to passage over a mantle plume track.
Sediment flux from the Appalachian region to the Cordilleran foreland basin during middle Cretaceous time may have been related to increased uplift and exhumation due to passage over a mantle plume track.During middle Cretaceous time, North American tectonics were dominated by the growth of the North American Cordillera and development of a regional north-south–trending foreland basin system
During middle Cretaceous time, North American tectonics were dominated by the growth of the North American Cordillera and development of a regional north-south–trending foreland basin systemThe basin was flooded by the Western Interior Seaway during Cretaceous time and separated a convergent margin fold-and-thrust belt to the west (Sevier orogeny) from low-lying craton to the east (Fig

New detrital zircon U-Pb geochronologic data are presented here from the Albian–Cenomanian Dakota Formation, which is exposed in a relatively continuous belt from southwestern Minnesota to central Kansas (Fig2)

As a result, the middle Cretaceous paleogeography of the midcontinent, as well as the sediment supply from the craton to the Cordilleran foreland basin, has remained poorly constrained.Sedimentologic and stratigraphic models for the Dakota Formation have been established from type section localities in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa (Fig
The Albian Nishnabotna Member is characterized by conglomerate and sandstone interpreted to represent braided stream and tidally influenced incised-paleovalley deposits (Fig3)
The paleovalleys are incised into Paleozoic bedrock, have up to 115 m of relief, and are interpreted to have developed sometime between 160 and 105 Ma (Late Jurassic–middle Cretaceous; Anderson and McKay, 1999; Ludvigson, 1999; Joeckel et al., 2005)The Cenomanian Woodbury Member is dominated by mudstone and shale with relatively minor sandstone and is interpreted to represent meandering stream and marginal marine deposits.

Formation were Paleozoic carbonate bedrock and Precambrian crystalline rocks located in eastern Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Illinois (Witzke and Ludvigson, 1994, 1996)The authors did note, however, that several lines of evidence would allow for sediment contribution from Appalachian sources
Specifically, the lack of a topographic barrier between the Western Interior Seaway and the Appalachian Mountains, the presence of isolated middle Cretaceous coarse-grained strata widespread across eastern North America, and a lack of middle Cretaceous sediments in the Mississippi Embayment strata south of the Ouachita uplands all suggest that a transcontinental fluvial system could have flowed from east to west across the continent during middle Cretaceous time.Four samples were collected from Dakota Formation outcrops located in western Iowa and eastern Nebraska
Approximately 78 percent of detrital zircon grains are Grenvillian (1.3–1.0 Ga; Mesoproterozoic on Fig1), Pan-African (725– 535 Ma; Neoproterozoic on Fig
1), Pan-African (725– 535 Ma; Neoproterozoic on Fig1), or Paleozoic (515–285 Ma) in age, which closely match the ages of bedrock sources located within the Appalachian Mountains (Fig
1), or Paleozoic (515–285 Ma) in age, which closely match the ages of bedrock sources located within the Appalachian Mountains (Fig1)
The lack of significant Paleoproterozoic- (1.85–1.6 Ga) or Archean-aged (>2.5 Ga) zircons indicates that northern source regions in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Canada did not contribute the bulk of sediment, as was previously interpreted.Grenvillian, Pan-African, and Paleozoic grains may also have been recycled from Appalachian or Ouachita foreland basin strata (Figs
Grenvillian, Pan-African, and Paleozoic grains may also have been recycled from Appalachian or Ouachita foreland basin strata (Figs4B and 4C); however, a sediment source in the Appalachian or Ouachita foreland basins would still require continental-scale, westwardflowing fluvial systems

In addition, abundant Paleoproterozoic- and Archean-age populations in Cambrian and older strata from the upper midcontinent and Midcontinent Rift area preclude these rocks as a dominant sediment source (Figs4D and 4E).
The data set presented here represents the first analysis of detrital zircon age distributions from the Dakota Formation in the midcontinent, and is interpreted to document the presence of a westward-flowing transcontinental fluvial system that stretched from the Appalachian region to at least the midcontinent during middle Cretaceous timeIn western North America, the archetypal Sevier thrust belt and foreland basin began to take shape during late Albian and Cenomanian time (Fig
In western North America, the archetypal Sevier thrust belt and foreland basin began to take shape during late Albian and Cenomanian time (Fig1)
During the mid-Cretaceous, Iowa and Nebraska were located on the craton east of the Cordilleran foreland basin system, whereas the modern-day Bighorn Basin in Wyoming was located in the foredeep (Fig1)
Paleocurrent indicators and provenance studies from Albian and Cenomanian strata in the Bighorn Basin demonstrate that the development of the foldand-thrust belt created new sediment sources and increased sediment flux from the western margin of the evolving Cordilleran foreland basin (DeCelles, 2004)Existing detrital zircon data from the Bighorn Basin provide evidence that most of the sediment in the foredeep was derived from the adjacent fold-and-thrust belt (May et al., 2013).
The exception to this is the early–middle Albian Greybull Sandstone of the Cloverly Formation in the eastern Bighorn Basin (GB on Fig3), which exhibits west- and southwestdirected paleoflow indicators (Winslow and Heller, 1987; Kvale and Vondra, 1993; Zaleha, 2006)

Cenomanian strata in the Bighorn Basin (Fig5B), in contrast, have a very different detrital signature compared to the coeval Dakota Formation in the midcontinent (Fig
The continued existence of the transcontinental fluvial systems through at least Cenomanian time, however, suggests that sediment was likely still being delivered to the back-bulge region after Albian timeThese results indicate that standard foreland basin models may underestimate the amount of sediment input from the craton side of the basin, especially in the back-bulge region.
