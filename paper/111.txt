Triassic to Neogene evolution of the south-central Andean arc determined by detrital zircon U-Pb and Hf analysis of Neuquén Basin strata, central Argentina (34°S–40°S)DEPARTMENT OF GEOSCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA, 1040 4TH STREET, TUCSON, ARIZONA 85721, USA
Strata ranging in age from Middle Jurassic to Neogene were sampled and analyzed to determine their detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra and Hf isotopic compositionWhen all detrital zircon data are combined, results indicate that significant pulses in magmatic activity occurred from 190 to 145 Ma, and at 129 Ma, 110 Ma, 67 Ma, 52 Ma, 16 Ma, and 7 Ma
There was a large shift toward more juvenile Hf isotopic values at 16 Ma that is consistent with renewed extension in the backarc during the NeogeneOverall geochemical trends in the Neuquén Basin section of the Andean arc are different from those observed in the central (21°S–26°S) and southern Andean arc (41°S–46°S), suggesting a segmented margin with variable tectonic settings and arc processes controlling magmatic output and chemistry along strike.
The Andean magmatic arc of central Chile and Argentina has been active since at least 190 Ma (Hervé et al., 1988; Franzese et al., 2003) with variable volcanic output caused by changing tectonic regimes, including extension from the Late Triassic to Late Cretaceous(Sagripanti et al., 2013), contraction from the Late Cretaceous to Eocene (Tunik et al., 2010; Di Giulio et al., 2012), and variable extension and contraction along strike in the late Paleogene to Neogene (Ramos and Kay, 2006)

age from the Late Triassic to Neogene (Howell et al., 2005) and thus preserves a detrital record of arc activity during variable tectonic conditions.The detrital zircon U-Pb signatures from strata in retroarc basins closely resemble the age distribution produced through in situ sampling of intermediate and felsic volcanic and plutonic units, specifically when it comes to identification of high-flux magmatic events (Kay et al., 2005; Ducea et al., 2015; Paterson and Ducea, 2015)
Periods of regional shortening and crustal thickening in northern Argentina and southern Bolivia correlate with high-flux events and periods of lithospheric removal (DeCelles et al., 2009, 2015)According to these models, the underthrusting of continental lower crust and mantle lithosphere under the arc produces periodic high-flux magmatism characterized by more evolved isotopic compositions because of melting of crustal material (Ducea, 2001; Haschke et al., 2002).
The arc narrowed again between 28 and 8 Ma, was inactive from 8 to 3 Ma, and volcanism from the Pliocene to the present is concentrated in a narrow zone (Herve et al., 1988; Haschke et al., 2006)Initial Sr and Nd isotopes between 200 and 20 Ma evolved from crust-like to mantle-like ratios, with a reversal at 20 Ma to more diffuse and crust-like ratios (Haschke et al., 2006).
In order to assess arc behavior through time and its relations with orogenic scale processes, I sampled and analyzed Middle Jurassic to Neogene strata from the Neuquén Basin to determine detrital zircon U-Pb age spectra and Hf isotopic compositionsThe goals of this study are to (1) identify the geochronologic and geochemical markers associated with variable tectonic regimes in a Cordilleran-style volcanic arc by comparing and analyzing the retroarc basin detrital record; and (2) evaluate the detrital record of magmatism along strike by comparing the Neuquén Andes (34°S–40°S) with the central (21°S–26°S) and southern (41°S–46°S) Andes
The Neuquén Basin is located in a retroarc position and is characterized by a variable tectonic history, including (1) extension during the Late Triassic–Middle Jurassic as manifested by isolated rift basins (Franzese et al., 2006; Franzese and Spalletti, 2001); (2) a MiddleJurassic–Early Cretaceous backarc basin (Spalletti and Franzese, 2000; Howell et al., 2005); (3) a Late Cretaceous (95 Ma) to Eocene retroarc foreland basin (Vergani et al., 1995; Howell et al., 2005; Tunik et al., 2010; Di Giulio et al., 2012, 2016; Balgord and Carrapa, 2016; Fennell et al., 2015); and (4) variable extension and contraction along the length of the Neuquén Basin with extension dominant from 28 to 18
Jurassic–Early Cretaceous backarc basin (Spalletti and Franzese, 2000; Howell et al., 2005); (3) a Late Cretaceous (95 Ma) to Eocene retroarc foreland basin (Vergani et al., 1995; Howell et al., 2005; Tunik et al., 2010; Di Giulio et al., 2012, 2016; Balgord and Carrapa, 2016; Fennell et al., 2015); and (4) variable extension and contraction along the length of the Neuquén Basin with extension dominant from 28 to 1817 to 6 Ma (Silvestro and Atencio, 2009), and extension from 6 Ma to present (Ramos and Kay, 2006, and references therein).
The Chilenia, Cuyania, Pampia, and Patagonia terranes compose the basement of the Neuquén Basin, and were accreted onto the Rio de la Plata craton on the southwestern margin of Gondwana during the Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic (Fig1; Ramos, 2010).
(2004) identified three episodes of juvenile crustal development in southern Gondwana during the Precambrian: 3.4–2.7 Ga, 2.4–1.9 Ga, and 1.5–0.8 Ga, based on the geochemistry of detrital zircons from the Carboniferous accretionary prism and batholiths in the Mesozoic volcanic arcDuring the Paleozoic, zircons from arc-related calc-alkaline magmas were derived from a recycled crustal reservoir of Mesoproterozoic age, probably represented by the Chilenia terrane (Willner et al., 2008)
During the Paleozoic, zircons from arc-related calc-alkaline magmas were derived from a recycled crustal reservoir of Mesoproterozoic age, probably represented by the Chilenia terrane (Willner et al., 2008)Following the early Paleozoic accretionary events, a magmatic arc and accretionary prism developed along the western and southern margin of Gondwana between 320 and 250 Ma (Hervé et al., 1988; Willner et al., 2005, 2008).
Following the early Paleozoic accretionary events, a magmatic arc and accretionary prism developed along the western and southern margin of Gondwana between 320 and 250 Ma (Hervé et al., 1988; Willner et al., 2005, 2008).Widespread magmatism associated with orogenic collapse following the early Carboniferous Gondwanan orogeny (Ramos, 1984) led to the formation of abundant late Permian to Early Triassic rhyolites and granites known as the Choiyoi igneous complex in the northern Patagonia terrane (Fig
Widespread magmatism associated with orogenic collapse following the early Carboniferous Gondwanan orogeny (Ramos, 1984) led to the formation of abundant late Permian to Early Triassic rhyolites and granites known as the Choiyoi igneous complex in the northern Patagonia terrane (Fig1; Kay et al., 1989; Rocha-Campos et al., 2011)
The Choiyoi igneous complex to the north of the Patagonia terrane, in the southern central Andes, has been linked to flat-slab subduction in the late Paleozoic (Ramos and Folguera, 2009)The Choiyoi igneous complex comprises lower and upper sequences with ages of ca

The middle Jurassic to lower Cretaceous sedimentary units analyzed in this study include the middle Jurassic Las Lajas Formation, the upper Jurassic Lotena and Tordillo Formations, the upper Jurassic to lower Cretaceous Vaca Muerta and Picun Liufu Formations, and the lower Cretaceous Agrio, Huitrín, and Rayoso Formations (Fig2; Legarreta and Gulisano, 1989; Legarreta and Uliana, 1991)
Conversely, the upper Cretaceous Neuquén Group in the central Neuquén Basin (Leanza and Hugo, 2001; Leanza et al., 2004), and correlative DiamanteFormation (Balgord and Carrapa, 2016) in the northern Neuquén Basin, are dominantly fluvial and lacustrine in nature
There are minor marine deposits in the Loncoche and Roca Forma tions of the upper Cretaceous–PaleoceneMalargüe Group (Barrio, 1990a, 1990b)
The Tristeza Formation is composed of coarse sandstones and conglomerates derived from the uplifted Mesozoic units to the west that were deposited during active shortening in the late Miocene (Yrioygen, 1993; Silvestro and Atencio, 2009; Sagripanti et al., 2011)The Arroyo Palao Formation is age equivalent, or slightly younger than the Tristeza Formation, but is 100 km south and west, within an active zone of Neogene extension and volcanism (Rovere et al., 2000).
The Arroyo Palao Formation is age equivalent, or slightly younger than the Tristeza Formation, but is 100 km south and west, within an active zone of Neogene extension and volcanism (Rovere et al., 2000).The transition from extension to compression and therefore backarc basin (thermally controlled subsidence) to foreland basin (flexurally controlled subsidence) sedimentation was between 100 and 95 Ma along the length of the Neuquén Basin (Vergani et al., 1995; Howell et al., 2005; Tunik et al., 2010; DiGuilio et al., 2012; Balgord and Carrapa, 2016; Fennell et al.,

The Neogene tectonic history of the Neuquén Basin is complicated by variable extension and contraction along strike as well as proposed flat-slab subduction north of 38°S between 20 and 5 Ma (Fig3; Ramos and Kay, 2006; Litvak et al., 2015).
from the Middle Jurassic to Miocene (Fig2)
The new data set presented exhibits three major pulses of magmatic activity preceding the Jurassic to modern Andean magmatic arc (Fig4): (1) Carboniferous grains related to the pre-Andean subduction margin; (2) grains from the Choiyoi igneous complex, 285 Ma and 265– 250 Ma; and (3) 230 and 220 Ma volcanic and plutonic signals associated with rifting of the Neuquén Basin (Fig

Between the end of Neuquén rifting and the initiation of the Jurassic to modern Andean volcanic arc (ca190 Ma) the Hf signature became 5–10 epsilon units more evolved, suggesting progressive melting and reworking of older crust during early subduction (e.g., Hildreth and Moorbath 1988)

There were only two main phases of shortening at the latitudes of the Neuquén Basin in the Late Cretaceous and Miocene (Yrigoyen,1993; Manceda and Figueroa, 1995; Silvestro et al., 2005; Zamora Valcarce et al., 2006; Giambiagi et al., 2005, 2008); they correlate directly with the two main magmatic pulses (ca
The latter shift toward more juvenile compositions was caused by variable extension from Oligocene to Pliocene that was broken by only a short phase of compression from 11 to 6 MaIt is difficult to assess isotopic variability at these latitudes during initial shortening (95 Ma) because of the lack of zircons of that age within the foreland strata (Figs
There is a switch to more evolved values that begins in the Miocene(Haschke et al., 2006; Fig
This variable behavior may be due to Late Cretaceous shortening along western margin of the Neuquén Basin (Vergani et al.,1995; Tunik et al., 2010; Di Giulio et al., 2012, 2016; Balgord and Carrapa, 2016; Fennell et al., 2015) that is also documented south of 45°S (Fildani et al., 2003), but is earlier (Early Cretaceous) and dominated by thick-skinned deformation much farther (to 500 km) from the trench between 40°S and 45°S (Echaurren et al., 2016; Gianni et al., 2015)

The volcanic arc along the western margin of the Neuquén Basin and southern Andean segment has been relatively stationary through time, with only one major eastward shift in the Cretaceous (Echaurren et al., 2016; Gianni et al., 2015), and the fold and thrust belt exhibits significantly less shortening and has much lower topography than what is observed in the central Andes (Kley and Monaldi, 1998)The paucity of shortening, which corresponds with less underthrusted crustal material interacting with the volcanic arc, may be what is dampening cyclic isotopic behavior in the arc.
