Barremian requieniid communities from Provence (SE France)Centre de Se´dimentologie-Pale´ontologie, associe´ au C.N.R.S., Universite´ de Provence, 13331 Marseille Cedex 03, France
Rudist-bearing sediments from platform carbonates of Late Barremian age (Early Cretaceous) cropping out in the Marseille region (Provence, SE France), were investigated on a 46 km wide transect, after seven stratigraphic sections, to quantify the role of rudists in the corresponding stratigraphic system, by using various proxiesThe regional stratigraphic contribution ( percent of total thickness) of rudist beds is relatively high (43.1 percent)
These values are very low when compared with those obtained, at a biological scale, for modern bivalves, Late Cretaceous rudists and recent coral reefsThe geological scale used for our estimates may partly account for this difference whereas low accommodation rates linked to Cretaceous greenhouse conditions appear a potential important factor in this respect
The geological scale used for our estimates may partly account for this difference whereas low accommodation rates linked to Cretaceous greenhouse conditions appear a potential important factor in this respectThe low net production of requieniid dominated communities, sediment dwellers not framework builders, also reflects their limited sedimentogenetic power

Rudist bivalves (superfamily Hippuritoidea) were prominent components of Cretaceous Tethyan shallow water, carbonate platforms (Masse and Philip, 1981; Ross and Skelton, 1993; Gili et al., 1995; Skelton and Masse, 2000; Steuber and Lo¨ser, 2000) where they are currently claimed to have been important sedimentproducers (Ross and Skelton, 1993; Carannante et al.,1993, 1997, 2000; Ruberti, 1997; Scott, 1995; Gili and Skelton, 2000)
In order to quantify the role of rudists in the overall inner platform sedimentation, requieniid-dominated communities from the Late Barremian of Provence (SE France) (Masse, 1976; Fenerci-Masse et al., 2004) were investigated by addressing the following aspects.The stratigraphic contribution of rudists, i.e
The Lower Cretaceous succession of Provence consists of platform carbonates the age of which range from Valanginian to Early Aptian (Masse, 1976)The Provence platform occurs on the south side of the Vocontian Basin, which represents the western extent in S.E

The Late Barremian is marked by the maximum northward platform spreading (Fig3).
In this region, from Cassis to Martigues, the so-called bUrgonian FormationQ begins with bioclastic coral beds ascribed to the Hauterivian–Barremian transition, grading upward to rudist-dominated beds, capped by a drowning discontinuity ascribed to the Late Barremian Giraudi zone (Masse, 1976; Ropolo et al., 1998) (Fig4).
5), is nearly 27 m thick, and is located in the topmost part of the Urgonian, in the Barremian (total thickness c350 m)
The presence in this interval of Palaeodictyoconus actinostoma Arnaud Vanneau and Schroeder and Paracoskinolina maynci (Chevalier) documents a Late Barremian age (Arnaud et al., 1998)Calcareous algae Hensonella urladanasi (Conrad et al.), Apinella hispanica (Conrad and Grabner) and Falsolikanella nerae (Dragastan, Bucur and Demeter) found in the upper part of the sequence corroborate this age assignment (Masse, 1993)

This thickness is in the range of those proposed from eccentricity cycles of Cretaceous platform carbonates (Strasser, 1994; D’Argenio et al., 1997; Buonocunto et al., 1999; Strasser et al., 2000; Sandulli, 2004; Anderson, 2004) or their Triassic equivalents (Haas, 1994), generated in an overall greenhouse worldThese values are corroborated by duration estimates deduced from the combination of biostratigraphic dating and radiochronological data
In the Marseille area the drowning of the Barremian platform is ascribed to the Giraudi ammonite zone (Ropolo et al., 1998), therefore the Upper Barremian succession underlying this drowning discontinuity represents only the Vandenheckii–Feraudianus intervalThe duration of the time span in question is 2.27 Ma for Hardenbol et al
far less than those reported for Holocene shallow water platform carbonates (e.gFlorida, Bahamas) fluctuating from 0.3 to 3 m ka1, and at the lower end of values for Kimmeridgian–Berriasian lagoonal sediments, 0.07 to 0.6 m ka1, the calculation of which involved decompaction (Strasser and Samankassou, 2003).
Florida, Bahamas) fluctuating from 0.3 to 3 m ka1, and at the lower end of values for Kimmeridgian–Berriasian lagoonal sediments, 0.07 to 0.6 m ka1, the calculation of which involved decompaction (Strasser and Samankassou, 2003).The production of carbonate for each rudist community is estimated by using the following parameters: the skeletal contribution of rudists to the sediment in  percent, which means that the production in question represents the net production, i.e
The method used herein for evaluating the CaCO3 production of rudist communities relates to a geological scale (Smith, 1983), based on the measure of accumulated carbonate divided by the estimated time increment over which that material accumulated; a proxy successfully applied for instance to the study of Holocene coral-reef accretion.6.1
Estimates of annual rates of shell accretion based on d18O and Mg cycles obtained for Requienia ammonia (a key species for community 4) from the Upper Barremian of Orgon (SE France) amount to 70 mm (Rauch and Steuber, 2002)Plasticine models of such R
This value is relatively high if compared to those obtained for Upper Cretaceous Hippuritidae and Torreitidae (0.012 to 0.075 kg a1) but comparable to that of the Campanian Vaccinites ultimus, (0.14–0.21 kg a1) (Steuber, 2000)Annual shell accretion of Hippuritidae has been used for modelling the production rates of rudist assemblages (Steuber, 2000)
The above estimates are higher than those obtained for the Barremian requieniid-dominated communities by a factor exceeding 100 to 250Requieniidae with a clinger life habit (sensu Skelton and Gili, 2002) actually differ from Hippuritidae with an elevator life habit (sensu Skelton and Gili, 2002) in having a more reduced packing density and therefore a more limited standing crop
This similarity is most likely the result ofcontrasting methodologies used for approaching carbonate production rather than ecological affinities between the Barremian and modern investigated bivalvesValues obtained for living mollusc communities were based on 2 years survey excluding episodic biological breaks (diseases, trophic crisis, storm events, etc.) (Richard, 1982)
By contrast estimates obtained for Barremian communities were based on reference durations in the range of 10 to 20 ka including necessarily ecological variability and therefore numerous episodic interruptions in the development of rudist communities,Quantitative ecological data on Barremian Requieniidae-dominated communities and CaCO3 production
Quantitative ecological data on Barremian Requieniidae-dominated communities and CaCO3 productionwhich represent time averaging of equivalent even noncontemporaneous elements (Kidwell and Behrensmeyer, 1993).
Another contrasting featureis the numberof individuals by m2 (see Tables 8 and 9), far less for modern Cardium than for Barremian formsThis may be due to the integration of several noncontemporaneous generations, at least in part
Rudists have been considered by some authors as the primary frame builders of the Cretaceous, and that, in doing so, they competed with and excluded hermatypic corals from reefal biotopes (Kauffman and Johnson, 1988)Alternative models proposed by Carannante et al
(2005) extrapolating the above present-day values of coral reef production (based on the alkalinity method) to the late Holocene is subject to errorsThe more accurate way to estimate CaCO3 production is to measure changes in well-dated coral reef sequences
The foregoing findings document some contrasting, even unexpected, results on the relationships between physiognomic, mainly qualitative and visual, and quantitative aspects, regarding the role of rudists in the Barremian platform carbonates of ProvenceThe relatively high stratigraphic contribution of rudist (43.1 percent at a regional scale) corresponds with a relatively modest skeletal contribution (12.8–13.2 percent)
The ability of Barremian rudists to produce sand size grains also looks limited, only 11 percent to 17 percent of the sandy fraction forming the substrate of communities derives explicitly from rudistsThis potential for producing sediments appears very limited when compared to corals
The focus on the last 5 ka of coral reef growth nevertheless implies an accommodation rate (see Discussion above) of 1 m ka1 whereas the Barremian one was in the order of 0.01 to 0.1 m ka1.We are aware that bioerosion may have been an important destructive process for rudist shells (Masse, 1976; Grosheny and Philip, 1989; Sanders, 1999) as it is for corals since the Mesozoic (Perry and Bertling, 2000), and consequently that our estimates for carbonate production s.l
We are aware that bioerosion may have been an important destructive process for rudist shells (Masse, 1976; Grosheny and Philip, 1989; Sanders, 1999) as it is for corals since the Mesozoic (Perry and Bertling, 2000), and consequently that our estimates for carbonate production s.lrepresent only a fraction of the original bioprecipitated skeletal material
In order to quantify the role of rudists in platform sedimentation, rudist-bearing stratigraphic carbonate successions from the Late Barremian of Provence (SE France) have been investigatedA stratigraphic unit, the Boumandariel sequence, 27 m thick on average, extending on a 46-km wide transect in the Marseille area, was analysed after 7 stratigraphic sections, with a spacing between 6.7 to 15 km
lagoonal bivalves, and late Cretaceous rudists, estimated at a biological scale, are poorly relevant with those obtained at a geological scale, used in the present studyComparisons with the production of modern coral reefs, using the same geological scaling approach, show that requieniid communities were not only different from corals by their ecological, sedimentological and constructional power, but also by their low CaCO3 net production
Nevertheless we regard the contrasting values of coral and rudist production as the result of contrasting accommodation rates, low in the Cretaceous greenhouse world and high in the Holocene icehouse world.We are most grateful to J
