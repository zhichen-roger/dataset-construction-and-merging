characterizing the Paleocene turbidites of the north Sea:the Mey Sandstone Member, lista Formation, uK central graben
Lithostratigraphic and sequence stratigraphic context of the Lista Formation and Mey Sandstone Member within the Paleocene of the Central North Sea(a) After Jennette et al
(2000) illustrating the sea-level cycles and resultant lowstand deposits of each of the major Paleogene cycles postulated by Neal (1996) and Den Hartog Jager et al(1993)
The precise number of Paleogene sequence stratigraphic cycles noted by different studies varies depending on the spatial and temporal resolution and spatial extent of the work (e.gten third-order cycles in Stewart (1987), 19 higher-frequency cycles in Neal et al
The Neal (1996) sea-level curve is utilized in this study because it remains the most widely accepted framework for understanding the Paleogene sequences within Northwest Europe and forms the basis of many previous papers (e.gJennette et al
A number of authors have published sand presence/absence and approximate thickness maps for the Paleocene turbiditic sands of the Central North Sea based on biostratigraphic and sequence stratigraphic intervals and associated well data (Stewart 1987; Kulpecz & Van Guens 1990; Knox & Holloway 1992; Den Hartog Jager et al1993; Vining et al
The majority of published research on the Paleocene of the Central North Sea has been conducted by oil companies interested in characterizing the reservoir units of major hydrocarbon fields or placing their licences in a wider context (sensu Ahmadi et al2003)
The major control on these trends is the relict Mesozoic graben structure with the major lineaments and intra-basinal horsts defining the sediment distribution (e.gO’Connor & Walker 1993; Mudge & Bujak 1996a; Hempton et al
Further local modification is provided by salt diapirs, which were actively growing and resulting in bathymetric features during the Paleocene (Hodgson et al1992; Davison et al
The need for a greater understanding of the Mey Sandstone Member has increased with the desire to explore for North Sea hydrocarbons in subtle stratigraphic traps and with the ongoing discussion over what these cycles can reveal concerning shelfal sorting and storage processes and timing of hinterland uplift during the Paleogene (cfSele cycle analysis of Den Hartog Jager et al
(2005) (the relict Mesozoic graben structure) also applied during the Lista FormationHowever, there are a number of subtle variations between these maps
It has been proposed that relative sea-level changes are the main control on sediment routing from the shelf to the basin during the Paleogene, with turbidites being deposited in the main lowstands (Den Hartog Jager et al1993; Neal 1996; White & Lovell 1997; Jennette et al
The Paleogene turbidite systems are typically referred to as basinfloor submarine fans (e.gDen Hartog Jager et al
Secondly, the control of relative sea-level changes on the Paleogene sequences can be further elucidatedAlthough these have been recognized previously, assumptions have been made, based mainly on the Sele Formation (e.g
This paper presents an integrated model of the spatial extent of the Paleocene Mey Sandstone Member within the Lista Formation of the Central North SeaDetailed mapping from seismic data, wells and core examples allows distinct axial and lateral fairways of turbidite flows to be defined which show distinct similarities and differences with the distribution of sandstones within the overlying Sele Formation
These main depositional fairways (with thick proximal areas in the NW and thin distal areas towards the SE) appear to have been controlled predominantly by the bathymetry of the seafloor which, in turn, is defined by the relict Mesozoic graben structureDetailed maps and correlation panels are presented, which show that the intra-Lista turbidite cycles deposited material in a prograding nature before a late episode of backstepping
Finally, although the deep-water deposits of the North Sea Paleogene have often been described as basin-floor submarine fans, it should be noted that this is an atypical system with considerable modification provided by the underlying topography and with multiple sediment entry points.This work was compiled as part of the PhD project of Ben Kilhams, which is focused on the Maureen and Lista Formations of the Central North Sea and sponsored by Shell Upstream International (UI) Europe
