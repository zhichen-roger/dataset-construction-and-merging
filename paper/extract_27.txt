While Gondwana assembly appears to have been complete by the end of the Neoproterozoic, magmatism and tectonism continued until 450 Ma, probably as a result of newly established subduction zones along the margins (Ramezani and Tucker, 2003; Boger and Miller, 2004; Cawood et al., 2007; Horton et al., 2008)During the late Permian, Gondwana began rifting apart, first as terranes along the edges and then as entire continents

These Cambrian rocks contain one major group of 800–550 Ma ages that is a direct result of being sourced from the Arabian–Nubian shield which contains large volumes of middle-late Neoproterozoic magmatism (Wilde and Youssef, 2002; Avigad et al., 2003; Kolodner et al., 2006; Hassanzadeh et al., 2008)While the East Gondwana Paleozoic rocks have some ages within this range, this major peak is not represented and there are relatively few ages, especially in the 700–600 Ma range, indicating that little detritus from the Arabian–Nubian shield made it to the northern margin of India, possibly as a result of a major orogenic drainage divide created during the Pan-African collision of India with Africa (Fig

The 1250–1000 Ma ages are Grenville and the most likely sources are the late Mesoproterozoic orogenies of western Australia, west Antarctica and possibly eastern India (Boger et al., 2000; Fitzsimons, 2000, 2003; Condie, 2003; Meert and Torsvik, 2003; Cox et al., 2004; Veevers et al., 2005), which have already been proposed as the source region for the Greater Himalayan Sequence (Yoshida and Upreti, 2006; Cawood et al., 2007)The Prince Charles Mountains of Antarctica (Boger et al., 2000; Fitzsimons, 2003) and the Eastern Ghats of India (Mezger and Cosca, 1999) are a possible source for 1000–950 Ma ages, as well as the possibility of undated basement of Greater India, Tibet and western Australia

These as well as younger 850– 750 Ma ages are also common to the South China block, which some reconstructions suggest was located next to India in the early Paleozoic (Metcalfe, 1996, 2006; Scotese, 2001)However, even these models rift South China from Australia by the end of the Devonian and since the same 1000–850 Ma ages occur in upper Paleozoic Gondwanan rocks, this requires either an alternate source or recycled lower Paleozoic rocks.

On the other hand, this age signature is also largely missing from Permian–Jurassic sediments deposited in Permian rifts of eastern India (Veevers and Saeed, 2009), implying that other mechanisms may be responsible for the lack of a strong interior India signature from Greater Indian and Tibetan rocksSimilarly, Permian sandstones of the southwest Australian Perth basin lack a strong Yilgarn cratonic signature (Cawood and Nemchin, 2000)

Similarly, Permian sandstones of the southwest Australian Perth basin lack a strong Yilgarn cratonic signature (Cawood and Nemchin, 2000)It is likely that tectonic events, collisional in the early Paleozoic and extensional in the late Paleozoic, produced topography that prevented significant drainage from the interior of the continents to the shelf.

The lack of 1000–900 Ma ages in the western Himalaya and Qiangtang terrane may reflect a more westerly location of the Qiangtang terrane relative to the Lhasa terrane along Gondwana’s margin, farther from the early Neoproterozoic orogens of East Gondwana.Orthogneisses from the Amdo basement reveal two periods of magmatism, one in the early Neoproterozoic (920–820 Ma) and another in the Cambro-Ordovician (540–460 Ma)

Their age spectra are very similar to Carboniferous–Permian sandstones that are widespread across the Qiangtang and Lhasa terranes, suggesting their protoliths were late Paleozoic in age.We propose that the Amdo basement, and therefore possibly the Qiangtang and Lhasa terranes, originated from the Yangtze block of South China during the Neoproterozoic before amalgamating to Gondwana during the early Paleozoic, based on similarities in magmatic and detrital zircon ages

The later period of Cambro-Ordovician magmatism is widespread along the former margins of East Gondwana from Turkey to AustraliaThis magmatism was the result of oceanic subduction along continental margins of the newly formed supercontinent Gondwana as well as possibly terrane collisions (DeCelles et al., 2000; Gehrels et al., 2003a) in response to plate reorganization following Gondwana assembly (Boger and Miller, 2004; Cawood et al., 2007)

The presence of this magmatism in central Tibet indicates these terranes were associated with East Gondwana in the early Paleozoic, either as part of an exceptionally wide active continental margin similar to the North American Cordillera or the Australian Ross–Delamerian Orogeny (Cawood et al., 2007) or as terranes that collided with India at this time, creating the Cambro-Ordovician orogeny of the Himalaya (Gehrels et al., 2003a).The detrital zircon age signatures of upper Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic rocks of East Gondwanan are not very distinct, which unfortunately limits their usefulness for determining paleogeography
