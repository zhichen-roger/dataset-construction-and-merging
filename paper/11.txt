The fact that middle Eocene strata in Nepal were derived from the Himalayan thrust belt reduces the maximum time lag between the onset of orogenesis in the northwest and central Himalaya to no more than ~2 MyD 2004 Elsevier B.V
Plate reconstructions and stratigraphic data sets suggest that initial collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates occurred in northern India between latest Paleocene and earliest Eocene time (~55–51 Ma [8–11])Lower Eocene foreland basin deposits in northern India (Zanskar) and Pakistan contain clear-cut petrographic and trace element evidence for erosion of source terranes in the Indus suture zone and the northern Himalayan thrust belt [10–13]
Lower Eocene foreland basin deposits in northern India (Zanskar) and Pakistan contain clear-cut petrographic and trace element evidence for erosion of source terranes in the Indus suture zone and the northern Himalayan thrust belt [10–13]In contrast, the Eocene section of the Tethyan Himalaya north of Mount Everest (Zhepure Mountain area, Fig
In contrast, the Eocene section of the Tethyan Himalaya north of Mount Everest (Zhepure Mountain area, Fig1) consists of shallow marine carbonates [14,15] and the foreland basin record farther south in Nepal contains no obvious petrographic evidence of erosional unroofing of Himalayan source terranes until Early Miocene time [16] (Figs
1) consists of shallow marine carbonates [14,15] and the foreland basin record farther south in Nepal contains no obvious petrographic evidence of erosional unroofing of Himalayan source terranes until Early Miocene time [16] (Figs2 and 3)
The Eocene of Nepal consists of ~90–150 m of black shale, fine-grained quartz arenite, and limestone that accumulated in shallow marine environments [17,18]If the Eocene sections in Nepal and southern central Tibet (Zhepure Mountain area [14]) are indeed pre-collisional, then the possibility of a significantly time-transgressive, eastward propagating collision remains viable [8,15], with potential implications for total shortening and convergence estimates in the Himalayan orogenic belt.

Previous work hints at the possibility that Eocene strata in Nepal are actually composed in part of sediments derived from the nascent Himalayan thrust beltNeodymium isotopic data from Nepal [6] indicate that Eocene strata were derived partly from relatively juvenile sources, perhaps located in the arc and forearc region; however, these data by themselves cannot rule out a juvenile source in peninsular India, such as the mid-Cretaceous Rajmahal basalts
Neodymium isotopic data from Nepal [6] indicate that Eocene strata were derived partly from relatively juvenile sources, perhaps located in the arc and forearc region; however, these data by themselves cannot rule out a juvenile source in peninsular India, such as the mid-Cretaceous Rajmahal basaltsThe interpretation that Eocene rocks in Nepal are synorogenic deposits hinges entirely upon a small (only 18 grains) U–Pb detrital zircon data set that indicates a change from dominantly Early Proterozoic and Archean ages (between 1856 and 2562 Ma) in upper Cretaceous–Paleocene(?) strata to a mix of ages ranging between Archean and Early Cambrian (between 2446 and 531 Ma) in Eocene strata [16]

In this paper, we bolster previous interpretations of the provenance of Cretaceous through lower Miocene sedimentary rocks in the Nepalese Himalayan thrust belt with 775 U–Pb detrital zircon ages, nine Nd-isotopic analyses, and trace element data from 15 samples spanning the Cretaceous–Miocene transitionOur results firmly establish that the source of sediment in northern Greater India shifted from mainly southerly (cratonal) to northerly (from the growing Himalayan thrust belt) during Early Eocene time.
Our results firmly establish that the source of sediment in northern Greater India shifted from mainly southerly (cratonal) to northerly (from the growing Himalayan thrust belt) during Early Eocene time.The Himalayan thrust belt consists of four tectonostratigraphic zones that are separated by orogenwide fault systems (Fig
The northern zone is referred to as the Tibetan Himalayan zone (THZ) and consists of a thick succession of folded and thrust faulted [20–23] Paleozoic through Eocene carbonate and fine-grained clastic rocks of the Tethyan sequence [24–29]Tethyan strata were deposited along the northern margin of Indian Gondwanaland prior to, during, and immediately after its extensional break-up [26,27]
In the southernmost erosional outliers of Greater Himalayan rocks, granitic mylonites and undeformed granites of Cambrian–Ordovician age [29,32,37–43] are probable equivalents of Formation III orthogneissesLarge bodies of Early Miocene leucogranite are present in the upper part of the GHZ [32,35,44–46]
Large bodies of Early Miocene leucogranite are present in the upper part of the GHZ [32,35,44–46]The southern boundary of the GHZ is marked by the Main Central thrust, which is given local names where it bounds erosional outliers of the GHZ.
In Nepal, the Lesser Himalayan zone includes three lithostratigraphic units: the Lesser Himalayan sequence, of Proterozoic age; the Gondwana sequence, of Permian through Paleocene age; and the Eocene– lower Miocene deposits that are addressed in this paper [55]The Lesser Himalayan sequence includes quartzite, phyllite, slate, dolostone, limestone (locally chertbearing), amphibolite, and intrusive bodies of granitic augen gneiss (e.g., the Ulleri augen gneiss) [55,56].
The Eocene–lower Miocene deposits are described belowThe southern boundary of the LHZ is the Main Boundary thrust
The Subhimalayan zone is the frontal part of the thrust belt and consists of several imbricate thrustbounded panels of Neogene fluvial sandstone, siltstone, and conglomerate of the Siwalik GroupThe Siwalik Group constitutes the proximal foredeep and wedge-top portions of the Himalayan foreland basin system [41,61].
U–Pb relative age probability diagrams (using the program of Ludwig [81]) from Himalayan tectonostratigraphic terranes (bottom panel) and Late Cretaceous–Early Miocene strata of south-central NepalThe pink bars indicate age ranges of igneous rocks in Lesser Himalayan sequence (~1850 Ma) and Greater Himalaya (~500 Ma)
The High Himalayan leucogranites contain zircons that produce discordant ages interpreted to be a result of Early Miocene overgrowths on inherited early Paleozoic cores [32,48]Detrital zircons from the Tethyan sequence have ages that are similar to those of GHZ detrital zircons, with the addition of a younger population of ~500 Ma grains [43].
The metasedimentary rocks of the Lesser Himalayan zone are most likely Early Proterozoic (~1850–1500 Ma), and Greater Himalayan sedimentary protoliths are bracketed between Late Proterozoic and Late CambrianThese chronological interpretations are consistent with Nd-isotopic data that suggest greater antiquity for the Lesser Himalayan sequence in Nepal [6,48–51,54].
Crustal ages in India and surrounding regions of Gondwanaland (including Africa, Arabia, Australia, and East Antarctica) can be grouped as follows [65,66]: (1) Archean (N2.5 Ga) crust is widespread in India, central-eastern Africa (including Madagasgar), and western Australia(2) Late Archean–Early Proterozoic (~2.6–1.8 Ga) crust is present in northern Australia, northern India, eastern Africa, and locally in the Arabia–Nubia shield
(2) Late Archean–Early Proterozoic (~2.6–1.8 Ga) crust is present in northern Australia, northern India, eastern Africa, and locally in the Arabia–Nubia shield(3) Early to Middle Proterozoic (1.8–1.0 Ga) crust is most prevalent in the Eastern Ghats along the east coast of India, in the Singhbhum craton of northern India, eastern Africa, and in East Antarctica
(3) Early to Middle Proterozoic (1.8–1.0 Ga) crust is most prevalent in the Eastern Ghats along the east coast of India, in the Singhbhum craton of northern India, eastern Africa, and in East Antarctica(4) Late Proterozoic (1.0–0.6 Ga) crust is widespread in eastern Africa, Arabia– Nubia, and along the eastern coast of India
(4) Late Proterozoic (1.0–0.6 Ga) crust is widespread in eastern Africa, Arabia– Nubia, and along the eastern coast of India(5) Early Cretaceous magmatic activity was widespread from southeastern Africa to northern India and western Australia, and Cretaceous sandstones in the THZ are rich in volcaniclastic detritus [28]
(5) Early Cretaceous magmatic activity was widespread from southeastern Africa to northern India and western Australia, and Cretaceous sandstones in the THZ are rich in volcaniclastic detritus [28]Cretaceous igneous rocks are also common in the Gangdese magmatic arc and forearc directly north of the Indus suture zone.
Cretaceous igneous rocks are also common in the Gangdese magmatic arc and forearc directly north of the Indus suture zone.From the distribution of crustal ages, it may be inferred that: Archean detrital zircons in Lesser, Greater, and Tibetan Himalayan rocks have their ultimate sources mainly in peninsular India and possibly western Australia; Early Proterozoic detrital zircons, the signature of Lesser Himalayan rocks, were probably derived from northern India and igneous rocks that are widely represented in Lesser Himalayan strata (Fig

Cretaceous zircons would have been available from young igneous rocks in northeastern India (Rajmahal Hills, ~115–120 Ma [67]), from recycled sources in Cretaceous strata of the THZ, and from the Indus suture zone (~120–50 Ma [68,69])Therefore, it can be postulated that Himalayan pre-orogenic sediments of Nepal should be dominated by Archean and Early Proterozoic detrital zircons reflecting a southerly, Indian provenance
Therefore, it can be postulated that Himalayan pre-orogenic sediments of Nepal should be dominated by Archean and Early Proterozoic detrital zircons reflecting a southerly, Indian provenanceEarly synorogenic sediments should contain abundant Late Proterozoic grains, reflecting erosion of Tethyan and possibly Greater Himalayan rocks and a switch to northerly provenance
Early synorogenic sediments should contain abundant Late Proterozoic grains, reflecting erosion of Tethyan and possibly Greater Himalayan rocks and a switch to northerly provenanceWith continued erosion of the rising Himalaya, the abundance of Early Proterozoic zircons (recycled from Lesser Himalayan strata) should increase
With continued erosion of the rising Himalaya, the abundance of Early Proterozoic zircons (recycled from Lesser Himalayan strata) should increaseCretaceous zircons provide ambiguous provenance information, inasmuch as these could be derived from northern India, Cretaceous sandstones in the THZ, and the Indus-Yarlung suture zone.
Cretaceous zircons provide ambiguous provenance information, inasmuch as these could be derived from northern India, Cretaceous sandstones in the THZ, and the Indus-Yarlung suture zone.We address the timing of the transition from precollisional to syn-collisional sedimentation along the southern side of the Himalayan orogenic belt by analyzing detrital zircon U–Pb ages, Nd isotopes, and trace element compositions of upper Cretaceous through lower Miocene strata in the frontal part of the thrustbelt in Nepal

The Eocene–lower Miocene section rests above strata that are assigned to the Upper Gondwana series [17], including the Amile and Taltung Formations (Fig5)

Chronostratigraphic control on the Cretaceous– Early Miocene section in Nepal is based on a combination of biostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy, and radiometric datingThe Taltung Formation is reported to contain Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous plant fossils, and together with the Aulis basalt is correlated with the Rajmahal and Jabalpur Series in Peninsular India [17]
The Taltung Formation is reported to contain Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous plant fossils, and together with the Aulis basalt is correlated with the Rajmahal and Jabalpur Series in Peninsular India [17]The Rajmahal basalts have yielded whole rock and single crystal K–Ar and
The age of the Amile Formation can be bracketed only loosely between Early Cretaceous and Early Eocene time [17]This is consistent with the geochronological evidence discussed above concerning the underlying Taltung Formation, as well as 206Pb/238U ages of 118F2 and 120F2 Ma obtained in our previous analysis of detrital zircons in the Amile Formation [16].
The Bhainskati Formation in central Nepal is considered to be Middle to Late Eocene on the basis of abundant foraminifera and other marine fossils [17]However, the lower half of the formation in central Nepal has not been dated
Fuchs and Frank [74] reported a paleontological age of Late Paleocene–Early Eocene for the equivalent Subathu Formation in western NepalMathur [75] established a Late Paleocene–early Middle Eocene age for the Subathu Formation in northern India
Mathur [75] established a Late Paleocene–early Middle Eocene age for the Subathu Formation in northern IndiaThe ages of the Dumri Formation and its northern Indian lithostratigraphic equivalents (the Kasauli and Dagshai Formations) are not well documented
Age interpretations for these analyses are complicated by the known occurrence in the region of inheritance in zircons from ~500 Ma granitoids combined with early Paleozoic and Tertiary Pb-loss (or new zircon growth) in N1.0 Ga detrital zirconsThis produces discordant analyses in the 500- to 1000-Ma age range that are of uncertain crystallization age
Pb/U concordia diagrams for Cretaceous–lower Miocene detrital zircon samples from this studyError ellipses are shown for 1-sigma level of uncertainty, and only analyses that are less than 30 percent discordant are shown
As mentioned above, the Charchare sample yielded one grain with a mid-Cretaceous (125 Ma) ageIn contrast, detrital zircons in the Bhainskati Formation fall into three age groups at ~500–800, ~1000–2100, and ~2400–3200 Ma
Two of the 343 Bhainskati grains analyzed produced mid-Cretaceous ages (102 and 122 Ma) and one grain produced an Early Triassic age (243 Ma)Detrital zircon ages in the Dumri Formation are broadly similar to those in the Bhainskati Formation, with the addition of a few grains in the 470–500-Ma range and an increased relative proportion of grains in the ~1000–1500-Ma range (Fig
Plot of eNd(T) values of fluvial and marine shales and siltstones from latest Cretaceous–Paleocene(?) through Early Miocene strata of the Nepalese Lesser Himalayan zoneData reported in this paper are from the Charchare Conglomerate, Bhainskati Formation, and lower Dumri Formation
A similar pattern was documented in roughly age-equivalent Eocene–Lower Miocene foreland basin deposits of northernSandstones derived from orogenic terranes typically are rich in low- to medium-grade metasedimentary and sedimentary lithic grains (e.g., [1,80])
4), suggesting a source in the Early Proterozoic to Archean rocks of the Indian craton [65,66]Most significantly, the Amile zircon age pattern shows no sign of derivation from Tethyan strata or Greater Himalayan rocks, which are characterized by Cambrian to Middle Proterozoic ages
Most significantly, the Amile zircon age pattern shows no sign of derivation from Tethyan strata or Greater Himalayan rocks, which are characterized by Cambrian to Middle Proterozoic agesThe Bhainskati Formation shows a typical Tethyan zircon-age pattern, with significant numbers of 470–520 Ma grains that are generally not present in detrital zircons of the Greater Himalayan zone (Fig
Conceivably, these Cambrian–Ordovician grains could have been derived from Formation III orthogneisses and related granites of the GHZ, but this is not supported by Nd-isotopic data (Fig7) that indicate Greater Himalayan rocks were not exposed until Miocene time [5,6,76]
7) that indicate Greater Himalayan rocks were not exposed until Miocene time [5,6,76]In addition, the Albian (102 Ma) grain in the Bhainskati suggests a source in the Gangdese arc or Indus forearc region, where mid- to Late Cretaceous granitic rocks are widespread [68,69,82 and references therein]
In addition, the Albian (102 Ma) grain in the Bhainskati suggests a source in the Gangdese arc or Indus forearc region, where mid- to Late Cretaceous granitic rocks are widespread [68,69,82 and references therein]The Dumri Formation has a detrital zircon age distribution that is similar to that of the Bhainskati Formation, with a greater relative proportion of Late Proterozoic grains possibly reflecting input from Greater Himalayan rocks by Early Miocene time.
The Dumri Formation has a detrital zircon age distribution that is similar to that of the Bhainskati Formation, with a greater relative proportion of Late Proterozoic grains possibly reflecting input from Greater Himalayan rocks by Early Miocene time.The Nd isotopic data support previously published data [6] that indicate the Bhainskati Formation is more isotopically juvenile than the Dumri Formation
By Early Miocene time, eNd(T) values in the foreland basin sediments were identical to values from the Greater Himalayan sequenceThe Nd data suggest that the transition from southerly to northerly provenance can be isolated to the top of the Amile sandstone just above the 20-m level of the section (Figs
The trace element data provide evidence for sediment sources in mafic arc and ophiolitic rocks of the Indus-Yarlung suture zone during the Eocene part of the recordThe highest concentrations of Cr and Ni are from samples located in the lower part of the Bhainskati Formation (below the ~80-m level in Fig
The simplest explanation of the provenance of the Cretaceous through lower Miocene strata is as follows:The Charchare Conglomerate and Amile Formation were derived from the northern Indian craton, with perhaps minor additions of detritus from the Cretaceous Rajmahal igneous province and/or related volcanic sources in northeastern cratonic India (Fig
The Charchare Conglomerate and Amile Formation were derived from the northern Indian craton, with perhaps minor additions of detritus from the Cretaceous Rajmahal igneous province and/or related volcanic sources in northeastern cratonic India (Fig9)
In the single Charchare sample analyzed for Nd, a low Sm/Nd ratio and high Sm and Nd concentrations are consistent with derivation from alkaline igneous rocks such as the widespread Early Cretaceous volcanics in northern peninsular India.Beginning in Early to Middle Eocene time, an influx of 500–1500 Ma zircons accompanied initial erosion of the rising Himalayan thrust belt, which at that time was composed entirely of Tethyan sedimentary rocks and Cretaceous igneous rocks in the Indus-Yarlung suture zone and forearc
Beginning in Early to Middle Eocene time, an influx of 500–1500 Ma zircons accompanied initial erosion of the rising Himalayan thrust belt, which at that time was composed entirely of Tethyan sedimentary rocks and Cretaceous igneous rocks in the Indus-Yarlung suture zone and forearcThe presence of Cr-spinel in the dense mineral fraction from the Bhainskati Formation is a diagnostic signal that the suture
By Early Miocene time, the fluvial deposits of the Dumri Formation were being derived from both Tethyan rocks and Greater Himalayan protoliths, as indicated by the increased proportion of ~1100 Ma grains and the persistence of ~500 Ma grainsA negative shift in eNd(T) values (from ~11 to 15) in samples collected across the Bhainskati to Dumri transition supports the interpretation that Greater Himalayan protoliths in Nepal were not exposed until the Early Miocene [6,16]
A negative shift in eNd(T) values (from ~11 to 15) in samples collected across the Bhainskati to Dumri transition supports the interpretation that Greater Himalayan protoliths in Nepal were not exposed until the Early Miocene [6,16]A similar shift in eNd(T) values is recorded in Eocene to Early Miocene foreland basin deposits in northern India [83]
A similar shift in eNd(T) values is recorded in Eocene to Early Miocene foreland basin deposits in northern India [83]Moreover, petrographic data from Dumri Formation sandstones indicate a shift to relatively lithic- and plagioclase-rich compositions, suggesting sediment sources with Greater Himalayan affinity [16]
Coupled with thermochronological constraints on the Early Miocene age of exhumation of the Greater Himalayan sequence (e.g., [47]), our provenance data suggest that the Dumri Formation was derived from lower Tethyan metasedimentary rocks during initial emplacement of the Main Central thrust sheet.Zircons from the Middle Miocene to Pliocene foreland basin deposits of the Siwalik Group and modern river sands in Nepal [16,41] exhibit an increase in the older age fraction (particularly the ~1800-Ma ages), reflecting the increase in availability of Lesser Himalayan zircons that coincided with deep erosion into the Lesser Himalayan duplex and emplacement of the Ramgarh and Main Boundary thrust sheets
Zircons from the Middle Miocene to Pliocene foreland basin deposits of the Siwalik Group and modern river sands in Nepal [16,41] exhibit an increase in the older age fraction (particularly the ~1800-Ma ages), reflecting the increase in availability of Lesser Himalayan zircons that coincided with deep erosion into the Lesser Himalayan duplex and emplacement of the Ramgarh and Main Boundary thrust sheetsHowever, Nd-isotopic data from the foreland basin deposits [5,6] and the Bengal fan [53,54] indicate that Greater Himalayan rocks have been the primary source of siliciclastic detritus since the Early Miocene.
However, Nd-isotopic data from the foreland basin deposits [5,6] and the Bengal fan [53,54] indicate that Greater Himalayan rocks have been the primary source of siliciclastic detritus since the Early Miocene.The fact that detrital zircons in modern river sands [41,42] of known Himalayan provenance exhibit age patterns similar to those documented in the post-Amile Tertiary rocks adds robustness to the interpretation of Himalayan zircon provenance
Rowley [8,15] noted that the Eocene section at Zhepure Mountain (Fig1) in southern Tibet consists of shallow-marine carbonate and fine-grained clastic rocks that lack evidence for rapid subsidence as expected for a basin in which thrust loading was the principal mechanism of flexural subsidence
This region is almost due north of our study area and therefore raises the question of how this apparently preorogenic section is related to the Eocene section in the Lesser Himalayan zone of Nepal, which we interpret to be synorogenicWe suggest that the Zhepure Mountain area lay on the crest of a shallow-marine flexural forebulge during Eocene time, while the study area in south-central Nepal lay in the back-bulge depositional zone of the foreland basin system [84]
We suggest that the Zhepure Mountain area lay on the crest of a shallow-marine flexural forebulge during Eocene time, while the study area in south-central Nepal lay in the back-bulge depositional zone of the foreland basin system [84]Southward migration of the forebulge wave relative to Indian lithosphere produced the ~20-My disconformity between the Bhainskati and Dumri Formations
This model can be tested by combining elastic flexural models with an Eocene palinspastic reconstruction of the Himalayan thrust belt at the approximate latitude of our study area (Fig10)
For Eocene time, a broken plate is probably the most realistic, insofar as the Tethyan oceanic slab probably detached soon after initial collision [88]The palinspastic reconstruction of the Himalayan thrust belt is based on regional balanced cross sections in Nepal [59] and southern central Tibet [22,23]
The Cretaceous–Paleocene strata of southern Nepal were derived from the northern Indian shield and possibly Cretaceous volcanic rocks of northeastern IndiaEocene strata were derived from recycled Tethyan sedimentary rocks that were exposed in the newly developed Himalayan thrust belt, with contributions from the Indus suture zone
Eocene strata were derived from recycled Tethyan sedimentary rocks that were exposed in the newly developed Himalayan thrust belt, with contributions from the Indus suture zoneBy Early Miocene time, sediment derived from the Tethyan and Greater Himalayan zones began to accumulate in the fluvial Dumri Formation
By Early Miocene time, sediment derived from the Tethyan and Greater Himalayan zones began to accumulate in the fluvial Dumri FormationIn Nepal, therefore, the transition
Although the exact age of this transition is not known because of ambiguities in Amile Formation biostratigraphy and the lack of age control in the lower part of the Bhainskati Formation, the change took place sometime before Middle Eocene time (N49 Ma)This implies that, unless significant along-strike transport of detritus occurred, the onset of Himalayan orogeny in Nepal was at most only slightly younger than it was in the Zanskar Himalaya to the northwest
In this case, the Eocene sandstones of Nepal have ultrastable compositions because the region was situated at equatorial latitudes during deposition [16]The durability of detrital zircons and stability of Nd isotopes even in the face of extreme weathering conditions [3] presents an ideal opportunity to assess provenance with isotopic methods.
