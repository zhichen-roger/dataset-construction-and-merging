Abstract – The Aptian stratigraphic record of the Alicante region consists of: a rudist and coral-rich carbonate platform of earliest Aptian age (Llopis Formation), with a discontinuous siliciclastic member at its top; followedby late Early, to Late Aptian hemipelagic marls andmarlstones (Almadich Formation); andthen by renewed carbonate platform development of Late Aptian to earliest Albian age (Seguilí Formation)
The same overall pattern of biotic turnover from the Early, to the Late Aptian is confirmed in other parts of Iberia and contiguous regions
Moreover, Iberian platforms of late Early Aptian age outside the present study area reveal a transitional phase with an increasing proportion of polyconitids in the outer platform-top to upper slope facies at the expense of caprinids
The siliciclastic influx at the top of the Llopis Formation implies a climatic shift from arid, to relatively more humid/pluvial conditions through the midEarly Aptian, as seen in several other Iberian sections
By contrast with these Iberian platforms, caprinids continued to dominate the outer platform-top zones of some central to southern Tethyan platforms until the close ofthe Early Aptian.This broadpalaeolatitudinal differentiation ofrudist associations within the Tethyan belt implies a climatic influence, whether exerted through thermal modulation of seawater pH and/or aragonite saturation, variation in nutrient flux, or any combination of these.

Within the broad context of interest in the greenhouse world of the Cretaceous, considerable attention has been paid to the remarkable oceanic, climatic and biotic changes that occurred during the Aptian, including the episodic growth and demise of Tethyan carbonate platforms
The two main platform developments in the study area chronostratigraphically encompass the early part of the Early Aptian (lower Bedoulian middle to upper Llopis Formation) and the late Late Aptian to earliest Albian (upper Gargasian to lower Albian Seguilí Formation)
In a final discussion section, we also review the macrobiotic constitution of selected platform developments outside the study area that represent the intervening late Early Aptian interval elsewhere in Spain, in order to characterize the pattern of faunal turnover in Iberian platforms throughout the Aptian
1a) are made of sedimentary units deposited on the Southern Iberian Palaeomargin (SIP) during the Alpine tectonic cycle (Triassic to early Miocene) (García-Hernández et al., 1980; Vera, 2001, 2004)
The initiation of seafloor spreading in the North Atlantic, which started very early in the Cretaceous, led to a decrease in the sinistral movement between Iberia and Africa that had prevailed during part of the Jurassic (Ziegler, 1988), and to a phase of rapid anti-clockwise rotation of Iberia relative to Europe that would culminate in seafloor spreading in the Bay of Biscay from middle Aptian times onwards (Olivet, 1996; Vergès and García-Senz, 2001)
That extensional tectonism experienced a strong phase during the latest Jurassic to the Hauterivian, followed, during the Barremian–Aptian, by an interval of lesser tectonic movements but larger subsidence rates, which favoured the development of wide and thick carbonate platforms (including the Urgonian facies) in the shallow areas of the basins (GarcíaHernández et al., 1980; Vilas et al., 2001; García-Hernández et al., 2001, 2003; Martín-Chivelet et al., 2002; Vera, 2004; Castro et al., 2008).
Basin analysis of the Prebetic platform (Vilas et al., 1993; Martín-Chivelet et al., 2002), has allowed the characterisation of the Early Cretaceous tectonosedimentary evolution of the Prebetic area, which was controlled by persistent, multiepisodic, extensional tectonics until the late Albian, when tectonic subsidence gave way to a generalized, complex, thermal subsidence
Within this interval, the Aptian represents a main tectonosedimentary episode (K4, Martín-Chivelet et al., 2002; Alonso-Chaves et al., 2004), bounded by two major discontinuities linked to extensional tectonic events that resulted in significant changes in basin palaeogeography and subsidence patterns
This Aptian tectonosedimentary episode corresponds to a second-order sedimentary cycle in the sense of Hardenbol et al
During the Aptian, carbonate and siliciclastic sedimentation alternated in the proximal parts of the Prebetic, whereas towards the more distal parts of the platform, well represented in outcrops in the province of Alicante, shallow-marine carbonates and hemipelagic sediments alternate, representing the transition towards basinal settings (Castro et al., 2008).
The Aptian stratigraphic record of the Prebetic of Alicante is represented by three formations, defined from the Alicante outcrops (Castro, 1998): the Llopis Formation, made up of shallow marine limestones with rudists and corals, locally with a siliciclastic member at its top (Lower Aptian of early Bedoulian age), the Almadich Formation, composed of hemipelagic marls and marlstones (Lower-Upper Aptian of late Bedoulian to early Clansayesian age) and the Seguilí Formation, with shallow marine limestones (Upper Aptianlowermost Albian of late Gargasian to earliest Albian age) (Fig.2)
2.1 Earliest Aptian Llopis Formation platform 2.1.1 Sierra de Mariola
2 and not considered further in this work), of Late Barremian age and containing scattered rudist debris (Fig
This unit is succeeded by the coral- and rudist-rich basal units of the main, carbonatedominated (Urgonian facies) middle member, of earliest Aptian age (Fig
We interpret this overall biofacies trend as broadly progradational, with the more disturbed, rudist/coral facies in the lower beds representing the more energetic external platform and the succeeding rudist-dominated beds having been more internally situated  in keeping both with the large-scale bedding and facies anatomy directly visible in the Sierra de Mariola, described above, and with the typical relative distributions of Cretaceous corals and rudists observed elsewhere (Skelton et al., 1997)
darderi (Astre, 1933) has been identified at Sierra de la Muela, to the west of the study area, in upper Barremian beds (FenerciMasse et al., 2011)
This pattern of rudist distribution on the platform top is consistent with that found in previous studies of Tethyan platforms of Early Aptian age (Fenerci-Masse, 2006; Skelton and Gili, 2012).
10), then by a marked decrease up to the top of the Lower Cretaceous (Castro et al., 2014)
In combination, these data indicate an early Aptian (Bedoulian) age for the top of the Llopis Formation (Castro, 1998; Castro et al., 2001).
While the youngest ammonites found in the lowermost beds of the Llopis Formation in the Sierra de Mariola can be assigned a Late Barremian, Feriaudianus Zone age (Castro 1998, p
astarte Fallot and Termier), the association at the base of the slightly more distal section of this formation in the Sierra de la Solana, immediately south-east of the Sierra de Seguilí, encompasses a terminal Barremian to earliest Aptian range in age (Castro 1998, p
So, although the orbitolinid and rudist taxa cited in Table 1 might otherwise be considered to allow a relatively broad Late Barremian to Early Aptian possible age bracket (e.
g., Clavel et al., 2013) for the middle to upper members of the Llopis Formation, the ammonite data cited above further constrain it to the Early Aptian.
The Cau section, located 10km to the south of the Seguilí section, and deposited in a more distal location within the Prebetic platform, records the complete Lower Aptian in the hemipelagic facies of the Almadich Formation (Castro, 1998; Aguado et al., 1999), and has provided a distinctive C-isotope stratigraphy, with recognition of the isotope segments defined by Menegatti et al
Three main phases of carbonate platform development are recorded from the mid-Gargasian up to the earliest Albian (Figs
And as in the lower Aptian Llopis Formation platform, tabular platform-top beds again show a pattern of repeated cyclic regression, involving dense rudist and/or chondrodont floatstones (e.g., Figs
(2018) from the lower Aptian of the Gargano Peninsula in SE Italy
This type of facies is best developed and shows larger specimens in the Clansayesian and lowermost Albian levels, and has also been described in sections from the upper Aptian of the Basque-Cantabrian basin (Gómez-Pérez et al., 1999; Millán et al., 2014)
the most prominent macrofossils in the Seguilí Formation are rudists, though with a strikingly altered cast with respect to the lower Aptian examples: thus, caprinids, previously so prominent, are now absent, while large requieniids (e.g., Pseudotoucasia santanderensis [Douvillé, 1889]; Figs
2), in order to gain a fuller picture of the changes in Iberian carbonate platforms during the Aptian
4.2 Aptian carbonate platform development beyond the Alicante region
The same overall pattern of biotic turnover from the Early to the Late Aptian has been documented in carbonate platforms in other parts of Iberia and contiguous regions (Masse, 1989; Masse et al., 1998; Skelton, 2000; Fenerci-Masse, 2006; Skelton and Gili, 2012)
In the southern Lusitanian Basin of Portugal, for example, the outer platform-top facies of the Ponta Alta Member of the Crismina Formation, of earliest Aptian (early Bedoulian) age, contains abundant and diverse caprinids, (Skelton and Masse, 1998; Burla et al., 2008; Huck
Further north, the distal platform-top facies of the “U2” Urgonian limestones in the North Provencal Platform likewise contains a rich and diverse caprinid fauna (Masse and FenerciMasse, 2011), while requieniids and monopleurids are distributed throughout the platform interior facies  though a recent revision of the ammonite biostratigraphy of that region re-assigns these U2 limestones to the Martelites sarasini Subzone of latest Barremian, rather than earliest Bedoulian age (Frau et al., 2018).
On the other hand, platform deposits of Late Aptian (to earliest Albian) age, entirely lacking caprinids, but with large requieniids (especially Pseudotoucasia) and polyconitids, as well as monopleurids and radiolitids, have been recorded from numerous localities elsewhere in Iberia, for example from Portugalete (Bilbao), as described in the classic palaeontological account of Douvillé (1889), to the Maestrat Basin in NE Spain (Malchus, 1998), as well as in SE Spain, in relatively more proximal settings to the north and west of the present study area (Masse et al., 1998).
These examples, particularly those situated within, or partly within the furcata Zone, reveal a transitional phase between the typical early Bedoulian (and/or latest Barremian), and the Late Aptian rudist faunas discussed above
To summarise, in Iberian carbonate platforms, caprinids, with largely aragonitic shells (having a calcitic outer shell layer of only sub-millimetric thickness; Skelton and Gili, 2012) dominated external platform-top rudist associations in the latest Barremian and early Bedoulian, but they were replaced by a consortium of large-shelled requieniids, polyconitids and radiolitids, together with Chondrodonta, all with relatively thicker (few to several mm) calcitic outer shell layers, in the Late Aptian
That the distributions of individual Early Cretaceous rudist genera were indeed susceptible to climatic influence has already been demonstrated by Masse and Fenerci-Masse (2008).
(2018) of the classic “U2” rudist limestones in the North Provencal Platform, from a previously supposed early Bedoulian age (Masse and Fenerci-Masse, 2011) to the latest Barremian, thus requires critical consideration
The Aptian stratigraphic record of the internal Prebetic zone in the Alicante region consists of three formations:
the Llopis Formation, of earliest Aptian age, comprising shallow marine limestones with rudists and corals, locally with a thin siliciclastic member at its top;
the Almadich Formation, of late Early, to Late Aptian age, composed of ammonite-bearing hemipelagic marls and marlstones;
the Seguilí Formation, of Late Aptian to earliest Albian age, with shallow marine limestones again containing rudists and corals
Building-out of the Seguilí Formation carbonate platform over the hemipelagic Almadich Formation took place in three steps (sequences), during the Late Aptian to earliest Albian
The same overall pattern of biotic turnover from the Early to the Late Aptian has been documented for carbonate platforms in other parts of Iberia and contiguous regions
Additionally, Iberian platforms of late Early Aptian age outside the present study area  hence intermediate in age between the Llopis and Seguilí Formations  reveal a transitional phase between these successive rudist faunas
Compared to the earliest Aptian examples, they show an increasing abundance of polyconitids in the outer platform-top to upper slope facies at the expense of caprinids, which became more localized prior to their “Lazarus”-style disappearance at the close of the Early Aptian.
The siliciclastic influx locally preserved at the top of the Llopis Formation platform implies a climatic shift from arid to relatively more humid/pluvial conditions through the mid-Early Aptian, similar to that inferred for several other Iberian sections
By contrast with the Iberian platforms, the outer platform-top zones of some central to southern Tethyan platforms remained dominated by caprinids until the close of the Early Aptian
