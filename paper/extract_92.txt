The Triassic–Jurassic sediments around the South China Craton show remarkable similarities in provenance signatures, revealing a syntectonic sedimentary zone extending from Korea to West China that probably developed in response to the subduction of the Palaeo-Pacific PlateIt is proposed that a westward-draining transcontinental palaeoriver system probably had existed across the Yangtze Block since the Middle Triassic, which might have originated from the eastern Cathaysia Block and shed detritus through the Yueshan, Jianghan and Sichuan basins to the Songpan–Ganzi Basin.
