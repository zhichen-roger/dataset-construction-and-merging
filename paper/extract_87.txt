Regional comparison of these new detrital zircon results with published data from Carboniferous and Permian sedimentary rocks in various terranes of Mexico and Central America, Appalachian foreland basins, Ouachita orogenic belt, midcontinent of United States, and Fort Worth Basin (Texas), indicates that most sediment influx to the Permian Basin during the earlyPermian (Wolfcampian and Leonardian) was derived from basement or recycled upper Paleozoic strata associated with Gondwanan and peri-Gondwanan terranes in modern Mexico and Central America

Data of Mississippian sandstones in Ouachita orogenic belt are from McGuire (2017).Group E detrital zircon ages (1300–1600 Ma) are most likely derived from the Granite-  Rhyolite Province (1300–1500 Ma) of the midcontinent (Bickford et al., 1986) and have been shown to be dominant in Leonardian strata in the Ancestral Rocky Mountains, such as the Paradox Basin (Lawton et al., 2015)

Although the distance from the midcontinent basement province to the Permian Basin is short, only 9 percent and 7 percent of detrital zircon ages in Wolfcampian and Leonardian samples, respectively, could be derived from this sourceThis is likely attributable to the fact that Granite-Rhyolite Province rocks were mostly buried in the midcontinent region and only exposed and eroded in local Ancestral Rocky Mountains basement uplifts.

Because detrital zircons with Pan-African ages are commonly reported in late Paleozoic strata in Mexico and Central America (Krogh et al., 1993; Lopez et al., 2001; Keppie et al., 2006; Weber et al., 2006; Weber et al., 2007; Martens et al., 2010) but very few are reported in late Paleozoic clastic wedges of Appalachian foreland (Thomas et al., 2004; Becker et al., 2006; Park et al., 2010), WC3 core-rim age pairs suggest the Mexican and Central American source.Lastly, one significant detrital zircon age cluster for Leonardian samples is characterized by 280–770 Ma rims and 340–2000 Ma cores (LC1 in Fig

If the large-scale transcontinental rivers made them all the way to Permian Basin, it is almost impossible that the fluvial systems preferentially deliver Group C zircons but don’t deliver the Group D zircons (notice the low proportion of Group D zircons in Leonardian samples and the same proportions of Group C and Group D zircons in Wolfcampian samples)Mississippian and Pennsylvanian sandstones in the Ouachita foredeep and the Fort Worth Basin also show distinct similarities in terms of proportions of main age groups and consistence of several age modes with Wolfcampian sandstone in the Permian Basin (Fig

Hence, it is possible that Wolfcampian sandstones either shared a similar age source terrane or were partially recycled from Carboniferous strata associated with the Fort Worth Basin and Ouachita orogenic beltPennsylvanian Fort Worth Basin sandstone provenance has been linked to the Appalachian foreland and/or Sabine terrane, a Gondwanan terrane incorporated in the Ouachita orogen during Alleghanian transpression (Alsalem et al., 2017)

This recycling process is consistent with westward progradation of sediment from the Fort Worth Basin and Eastern Shelf to the Midland Basin during Pennsylvanian and early Permian by fluvial and deltaic systems (Brown et al., 1990; Wright, 2011) and south to north deep-water sediment delivery systems in the south of the Permian Basin (Hamlin, 2009)Detrital zircon age peaks in Group B (350–500 Ma) and Group C (500–850 Ma) from Pennsylvanian sandstones in the Fort Worth Basin are also very similar to detrital zircon age peaks observed in the Santa Rosa Formation in southern Mexico, suggesting that the Maya terrane might be the ultimate source region and tectonic hinterland for both of these late Paleozoic depositional sequences.

Maya terrane, Fort Worth Basin, and Ouachita orogenic belt acted as major source regions for the Permian BasinDuring Leonardian times, during the waning stages of the AlleghanianOuachita-Marathon shortening in the southwestern United States, the relative proportions of Grenvillian sources, possibly from the Appalachian system and Ouachita orogenic belt, significantly decreased with a concomitant increase of Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic detrital zircon age components derived from Gondwanan and peri-Gondwanan terranes of Mexico and Central America such as Maya, Coahuila, Oaxaquia, and Mixtecan terranes.
