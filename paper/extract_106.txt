The Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm has an age not older than Langhian and geometrically lies above the Argille Varicolori Fm of the north-western corner of the Val Marecchia NappeThe field study did not enable us to establish whether the Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm evidences a sudden change in the sedimentation, marking the beginning of the foredeep stage in the basin in which the Argille Varicolori Fm deposited, or whether it represents an Epiligurian unit sedimented unconformably on the Argille Varicolori Fm after its deformation

In conclusion, from the data available, the most probable interpretation considers the Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm as a Langhian, or younger, Epiligurian unit, sedimented in a thrust-top basin, located on the Val Marecchia Nappe, during the orogenic transport of this nappe towards the Adriatic foreland.The Poggio Carnaio Sandstone Fm was supplied from the erosion of a source area consisting of prevailing metamorphic rocks (mainly phyllites and metasediments), acidic plutonites, Ligurian-like and HP/LT ophiolitic complexes and pelagic sedimentary covers (micritic limestones, shales, cherts, siltstones, etc.)

However, according to our data, the origin of the siliciclastic supply which fed the Oligo-Miocene turbiditic successions of Northern Apennines appears to represent a problem generally underestimated in the proposed models of the Northern Apennines evolutionWe believe that this problem can be solved only in a regional framework wider than this orogenic sector

The clastic supply of the Northern Apennines is usually related to the erosion of the chain of the Alps, but it is difficult to admit a provenance of a huge amount of siliciclastic supply, continuous from the late Oligocene to the Messinian, from the Alpine ChainMoreover, an abundant siliciclastic supply is present also in the Central and Southern Apennines, where it is locally characterized by large boulders, as the m3-sized blocks of granitoids in the Messinian deposits near Campobasso (CARRARA & SERVA, 1982).

Moreover, an abundant siliciclastic supply is present also in the Central and Southern Apennines, where it is locally characterized by large boulders, as the m3-sized blocks of granitoids in the Messinian deposits near Campobasso (CARRARA & SERVA, 1982).In conclusion, the Alps, and also the Sardinia-Corsican Massif, cannot be considered the source areas for most of the clastic formations of Northern Apennines (Macigno, Cervarola, Marnoso-arenacea, Laga Fms, etc.), as instead admitted

Our data imply that units similar to the Pennidic and Australpine Units of the Alps and Calabria-Peloritani Arc, at present fully eroded, probably represented the geometrically highest units in the Palaeo-Apennine Chain and fed the siliciclastic supply for the Oligo-Miocene turbiditic successions, including the Poggio Carnaio Sandstone basinOn the other hand, the hypothesis that the Alpine Chain was an orogenic belt formerly continuous from the Alps to the Calabria-Peloritani Arc, later dismembered by the opening of the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian basin, has been widely shared, as in HACCARD et alii (1972), ALVAREZ et alii (1974), and ALVAREZ (1976)

The hypothesis of Pennidic and Australpine units at the top of the Palaeo-Apennine Chain is also supported by the occurrence, just in the Northern Apennines, of gravels and pebbles of granitoids, augengneisses, amphibole-gneisses, amphibolites, garnetsillimanite gneisses and granulites, in some foredeep successions (PANDELI et alii, 1997) and mainly in the Pliocene conglomerates of the Adriatic piedmont belt.This research was supported by MIUR-PRIN 06 research project 2006 «Cenozoic clastic sedimentation in the southern branch of the Tethys in the Betic-Rifian Arc and northern Apennines: consequences for the palaeogeographic and palaeotectonic evolution of the central-western Mediterranean»
