The main age clusters for these zircon grains are Ediacaran to Palaeozoic with an additional peak at 1.3–0.9 Ga and they can be correlated with ‘Grenvillian’ age, and the Brasiliano, Pampean, and Famatinian orogeniesThe zircon data reveal main transport from the nearby Ordovician Famatinian arc and related rocks
The zircon data reveal main transport from the nearby Ordovician Famatinian arc and related rocksThe Silurian sandstone units are more comparable with Cambrian units, with Brasiliano and Transamazonian ages (2.2–1.9 Ga) being more common, because the Silurian deposits were situated within or east of the (extinct) Famatinian arc
The Silurian sandstone units are more comparable with Cambrian units, with Brasiliano and Transamazonian ages (2.2–1.9 Ga) being more common, because the Silurian deposits were situated within or east of the (extinct) Famatinian arcHence, the arc acted as a transport barrier throughout Palaeozoic time
Intense magmatism accompanied the evolution of an Ordovician magmatic arc (e.gPankhurst et al
After relative tectonic and magmatic quiescence during Silurian to Devonian time (Bahlburg & Hervé 1997), arc magmatism reoccurred during the Carboniferous to Permian periods (e.gBreitkreuz et al
Furthermore, two microplates are assumed to have collided with the central proto-Pacific South American margin during the Palaeozoic era: the Cuyania–Precordillera terrane during Middle to Late Ordovician time (e.gRamos et al
1986; Keller 1999; Thomas & Astini 2003) and the Chilenia terrane during Middle Devonian time (e.gRamos et al
During this time the climate varied and included two periods of glaciation during the Late Ordovician to early Silurian and Late Devonian to Late Carboniferous (e.gDíaz-Martínez & Grahn 2007; Gulbranson et al
We use detrital U–Pb zircon age distributions of Cambrian (Augustsson et al2011) and Ordovician to Permian sandstone to identify their source areas
2011) and Ordovician to Permian sandstone to identify their source areasThe data are combined with cathodoluminescence (CL) and backscattered electron (BSE) imaging to reveal the magmatic or metamorphic origin of the zircon grains and their abrasional regime (zoning, shape, degree of roundness; e.g
The Ediacaran to Palaeozoic development of the south–central Andean continental margin started after the amalgamation of Gondwana during Neoproterozoic time and the corresponding Brasiliano (Pan-African) orogeny between c750 and 500 Ma, a phase of intense granitoid magmatism and metamorphism in South America (e.g
In northwestern Argentina, the Early Cambrian Pampean orogeny took place along the Gondwanan margin (Rapela et al1998)
The Pampean orogeny was followed by intrusion of Cambrian, postorogenic granitoid bodies such as the Santa Rosa de Tastil and Cañaní batholiths (Augustsson et al2011; Escayola et al
Subsequently, the magmatic arc of an Ordovician orogeny (Fig1) possibly extended from Venezuela in the north to southern Patagonia in the south (Pankhurst et al
In the south–central Andes, the corresponding Famatinian orogeny had been initiated by Late Cambrian time and arc magmatism continued at least until middle Ordovician time (Fig2; e.g
The following relative tectonic and metamorphic quiescence is attributed to a subductionfree period, which lasted until the Carboniferous period in the south–central Andes (e.gBahlburg & Hervé 1997; Bahlburg et al
Indications exist for post-orogenic Devonian igneous activity in the Eastern Sierras Pampeanas (Grosse et al2009, and references therein)
The reinitiation of subduction in the south–central Andes is marked by increased intrusive and extrusive calc-alkaline activity particularly around the Carboniferous–Permian transition, but possibly already during Early Carboniferous time (Fig2; Breitkreuz et al
The Permian period was a time of intense igneous activity in northern Chile and northwestern Argentina (e.gDonato & Vergani 1985; Damm et al
Furthermore, both in southern and central Chile and Argentina and in Peru Permian calc-alkaline igneous rocks occur (e.gCarlier et al
Late Neoproterozoic to Palaeozoic deposition starts with turbiditic slope sediment of the Ediacaran to Early Cambrian Puncoviscana Formation and equivalents, extending from southernmost Bolivia to central Argentina (Fig1; e.g
The Puncoviscana Formation is overlain unconformably by the tidaldominated Middle to Upper Cambrian siliciclastic Mesón Group, which extends from southern Bolivia to northwestern Argentina (Kumpa & Sanchez 1988; Augustsson et al2011)
The emergence of the Famatinian arc resulted in the formation of the marine Lower Ordovician Cordón de Lila Igneous and Sedimentary Complex (CISL, Complejo Ígneo-Sedimentario del Cordón de Lila; Niemeyer 1989) in northern Chile in a forearc to intra-arc setting (e.gNiemeyer 1989; Zimmermann et al
A retro-arc foreland basin developed to the east during or soon after peak volcanic activity during Middle Ordovician time (Bahlburg 1991)The Ordovician basin extended north into Bolivia (e
The Ordovician basin extended north into Bolivia (eg., Egenhoff 2007), with the Ordovician successions being deformed during the Famatinian orogeny (e.g
g., Egenhoff 2007), with the Ordovician successions being deformed during the Famatinian orogeny (e.gNiemeyer 1989)
470–420 Ma (Middle to Late Ordovician time) in northern Chile and northwestern Argentina (Lucassen et al2011)
In this study, deposits of the foreland basin are represented by the Middle Ordovician Lower Turbidite System of the Puna Turbidite System in northwestern Argentina (Bahlburg 1990; Bahlburg et al1990), which is mainly composed of marine, turbiditic sandstone and pelite (Bahlburg 1990).
The development of a passive continental margin caused stable shelf conditions for shallow-water sedimentation during Silurian time (e.gBahlburg & Hervé 1997; Astini et al
The Quebrada Ancha Formation at Cordón de Lila in Chile within the belt of Ordovician magmatic rocks marks the westernmost occurrence of Silurian successions in northern Chile and northwestern Argentina (Fig1)
It is coeval with the Salar del Rincón Formation in westernmost Argentina, a shallow-marine siliciclastic unit with quartz-rich sandstone (Donato & Vergani 1985; Benedetto & Sánchez 1990) and with a depositional age around the Ordovician–Silurian transition (Isaacson et al1976; Rubinstein & Vaccari 2004)
In northwestern Argentina the Late Ordovician to Early Silurian glacial period is documented by the existence of the glacial lower member of the Zapla Formation (e.gGrahn & Gutiérrez 2001; Astini et al
The Silurian units in Argentina were deposited on the extinct Famatinian arc, on its eastern fringe, or to the east of the former arc.During Devonian time, kilometre-thick marine, turbiditic sequences formed along the tectonically passive margin of Gondwana, west of the former Famatinian arc (Bahlburg &

Sandstone and pelite of the Middle Devonian to Lower Carboniferous Zorritas Formation in easternmost Chile represent the transition from tidal to deltaic conditions (Niemeyer et al1997b; Isaacson & Dutro 1999)
Towards the end of the Carboniferous period, the deposits in the Cordillera de la Costa in Chile (El Toco and Sierra del Tigre formations) were affected by folding during the Toco tectonic event (Bahlburg & Hervé 1997; Niemeyer et al1997a).
The Sierra Argomedo Formation of poorly defined Devonian to Carboniferous age represents the shallow-marine part of a basin of pre- to post-Toco event age (Breitkreuz 1985; Marinovic et al1995)
Detrital zircon dating indicates an Early Carboniferous maximal depositional age for the upper part of the Sierra Argomedo Formation (this study)It mainly contains pelite and some sandstone with metre-thick volcanic or subvolcanic intercalations that are interpreted as flows or sills (Breitkreuz 1985; Marinovic et al
After emergence of the Carboniferous–Permian arc, a continental depositional regime prevailed in westernmost Argentina with the fluvial Cerro Oscuro Formation (Donato & Vergani 1985; Galli et al2010)
It is separated from the Late Ordovician to early Silurian Salar del Rincón Formation by an angular unconformity and is composed mainly of red sandstone and conglomerate (Donato & Vergani 1985)An angular unconformity, caused by the Toco event, also is present between the Devonian Sierra del Tigre Formation and the lower Permian Cerro de Cuevitas Formation in western Chile (Niemeyer et al
An angular unconformity, caused by the Toco event, also is present between the Devonian Sierra del Tigre Formation and the lower Permian Cerro de Cuevitas Formation in western Chile (Niemeyer et al1997a)

Zircon grains having oscillatory and sector zoning, typical for magmatic growth, are dominant in all sandstone samples (75– 98 percent; Table 1) and particularly in the Ordovician Puna TurbiditeSystem (87RG3), the Silurian Salar del Rincón Formation (SdR138), and the Devonian units (CC-08-135, QC-08-39, CP-08-09; >90 percent)
System (87RG3), the Silurian Salar del Rincón Formation (SdR138), and the Devonian units (CC-08-135, QC-08-39, CP-08-09; >90 percent)Most grains are subangular to subrounded (60 to >90 percent in single samples)
Euhedral zircon grains make up 8–28 percent, with the largest amounts (24–28 percent) in the Upper Ordovician to lower Silurian Quebrada Ancha Formation (CL-08-73), the Devonian El Toco Formation (CP-08-09) and the Carboniferous Cerro Oscuro Formation (CO-128; Table 1)The lowest amounts (up to 10 percent) occur in the Ordovician CISL (CL-08-66), the Silurian Lipeón and Zapla formations (AT-04, 02-66) and the Permian Cerro de Cuevitas Formation (CC-08-139)
The lowest amounts (up to 10 percent) occur in the Ordovician CISL (CL-08-66), the Silurian Lipeón and Zapla formations (AT-04, 02-66) and the Permian Cerro de Cuevitas Formation (CC-08-139)Rounded zircon grains make up only 9–15 percent in most samples (Table 1)
Grains from the Devonian Sierra del Tigre and the Permian Cerro de Cuevitas formations from the same sampling locality are particularly similar: they have the same mean length of 80 µm and are dominated by magmatic (>80 percent), subangular to subrounded (70 percent) and oval grains (50 percent), but the younger unit has a slightly higher proportion of metamorphic, rounded and round grainsMost grains in all analysed sandstone samples display only one growth zoning regardless of the roundness of the grains
All analysed sandstone samples contain 45–80 percent zircon grains with Ediacaran to Palaeozoic age that can be related to the Brasiliano (c750–500 Ma; e.g
2010), Pampean (Early Cambrian, probably ending at 520–490 Ma; e.g.Rapela et al

Sandstone of the mainly Silurian units to the east in Argentina (Salar del Rincón, Zapla, and Lipeón formations; SdR-138, 02-66, AT-04) also contains 10–20 percent Transamazonian-age zircon grains (2.2–1.9 Ga); the Salar del Rincón Formation sandstone (SdR-138) has a pronounced peak at c2.1 Ga (n = 5; Figs 4 and 5)
Other age clusters occur at 900–730 Ma (particularly in the Ordovician Puna Turbidite System, the Silurian Lipeón Formation and the Carboniferous partof the Zorritas Formation; 87RG3, AT-04, MS-08-60; 10 percent each) and 1.9–1.3 Ga (particularly in the Ordovician CISL, the Silurian Zapla Formation and the Permian Cerro de Cuevitas Formation: CL-08-66, 02-66, CC-08-139; 10–12 percent each), but without distinct peaks (Fig

The coeval deposits to the west in Chile (Quebrada Ancha Formation; CL-08-73) are more similar to the Ordovician sandstone samples with a Pampean or Famatinian age peak at c510 Ma (n = 7)
The Devonian deposits (Sierra del Tigre, El Toco, and Zorritas formations; CC-08-135, CP-08-09; QC-08-39) are dominated by Pampean to Famatinian age clusters at 530–510 and c470 Ma, as well as at 440–430 Ma, (n = 4–10; Fig
Similar to the Devonian units, the Carboniferous upper part of the Sierra Argomedo Formation in Chile (SA-08-125) is dominated by Pampean or Famatinian ages with a main age cluster at c490 Ma (n = 7; Fig

The age spectrum for the Permian unit (Cerro de Cuevitas Formation; CC-08-139) is dominated by Brasiliano (c600 Ma, n = 6) and Famatinian peaks (c
Hence, the spectrum is rather similar to that from the Devonian Sierra del Tigre Formation (CC-08-135) from the same sampling locality in the Cordillera de la Costa in ChileThe youngest age peaks always are in accordance with the estimated depositional ages or they are older (Table 3).
The large abundance of Late Cambrian to Ordovician ages implies that the Famatinian magmatic arc acted as a major source for detrital material throughout Palaeozoic time (Figs 1 and 6)The age peaks correlate with the timing for Famatinian activity (Table 3), because both peak magmatic activity and medium- to high-grade metamorphism were reached at 490–460 Ma in the Puna region of northwesternmost Argentina (Lucassen et al
Diamictite of possible Neoproterozoic age in northernmost Chile (Sierra Limón Verde) also is dominated by zircon of ‘Grenvillian’ age (Morandé et al2012)
To the south, Cambrian orthogneiss at c26°S in the Puna contains abundant inherited zircon of both ‘Grenvillian’ and c
(2007) also suggested a north–south-directed magmatic arc of Neoproterozoic age based on a back-arc-related ophiolite dated at 647 ± 77 Ma in the Eastern Sierras Pampeanas (whole-rock Sm–Nd).Local ‘Grenvillian-age’ sources are supported by the Devonian El Toco Formation and Permo-Carboniferous units in northern Chile (not studied here), which contain detrital zircon grains of c
Local ‘Grenvillian-age’ sources are supported by the Devonian El Toco Formation and Permo-Carboniferous units in northern Chile (not studied here), which contain detrital zircon grains of c1 Ga age with a mantle-influenced Hf-isotope signature (positive εHf values; Bahlburg et al
Ordovician to Devonian sandstone from southern Peru and northwestern Bolivia contains abundant zircon of ‘Grenvillian’ age with a mantle εHf signature (Reimann et al2010), and therefore equivalent parent rocks probably have been present in the central Andean region
Early Carboniferous rhyolite (350-340 Ma) occurs at 27–28°S in the southern Puna (Martina et al2011)
Middle Devonian to Early Carboniferous (c390–330 Ma) igneous activity interpreted to be post-orogenic or extension-related is also recorded (Grosse et al
shear-related metamorphic activity took place during Early Devonian time at c400 Ma (Höckenreiner et al
Longshore drift is in accordance with the scarcity of pre-Famatinian ages in the only analysed fluvial sandstone, the Carboniferous Cerro Oscuro FormationHere, apparently no or little transport from Brasiliano-dominated areas took place
Dominant north-directed currents also are in accordance with the transportation paths for Ordovician retro-arc foreland basin deposits in the southern Puna (Zimmermann & Bahlburg 2003).Longshore drift from far in the north is unlikely because of (1) the crustal Nd-isotope signatures for the ‘Grenvillian-age’ material in the Sunsás belt and the Peruvian part of the Arequipa–Pampia terrane (Santos et al
2.0–1.7 Ga) in addition to Ordovician arc intrusive rocks (Damm et al1990; Wörner et al
We also rule out the area of the Brasília belt in central Brazil with the Goiás Massif and the Goiás–Crixás Archean Block with main ages of >2.5, 1.8–1.5, and 0.8–0.6 Ga (Fig1; e.g
Previous studies have postulated main transport from the Famatinian arc for the Ordovician and Devonian units studied here because of the presence of volcanic detritus, palaeocurrent directions, and mafic geochemical influences (Breitkreuz 1985; Niemeyer 1989; Bahlburg 1990; Bahlburg & Breitkreuz 1993; Niemeyer et al1997b; Pérez et al
Long-lived local transport is in accordance with the Ordovician–Silurian age peak that is particularly distinct in some of the Silurian and Devonian sedimentary units, because granitoid bodies related to the igneous Faja Eruptiva Oriental in northwestern Argentina probably are of c440 Ma age (Bahlburg et al
Volcanic detritus in the Late Carboniferous, continental Cerro Oscuro Formation has earlier been assumed to be derived from the younger Carboniferous–Permian arc (Galli et al2010), but the zircon ages indicate that the extinct Famatinian arc was a major source
Accordingly, the zircon ages in the lower Permian Cerro de Cuevitas Formation can be explained by recycling of the Sierra del Tigre Formation owing to the similarities in age distributionThe grain size and morphology, with the high amounts of rounded and round grains in the Permian unit, also are in accordance with recycling
The grain size and morphology, with the high amounts of rounded and round grains in the Permian unit, also are in accordance with recyclingHence, the dominance of Famatinian-age grains indicates continuous transport from the same, nearby geographical region
The turbiditic Devonian El Toco and Sierra del Tigre formations have dominant palaeocurrent directions that indicate axial transport from the north in addition to the Famatinian arc source directly to the east (Fig2; Bahlburg & Breitkreuz 1993; Niemeyer et al
The limited occurrence of zircon grains with ‘Grenvillian’, Pampean, and Famatinian ages from the Silurian units in Argentina, deposited in a central position and to the east of the former arc, points to less input from the Famatinian arc and related rocksThe abundance of Transamazonian ages indicates that the main transportation path may have emanated from the Río de la Plata craton in the east (Figs 1 and 6), where igneous and metamorphic rocks of 2.2–2.0 Ga age are common (e.g
Transamazonian-age zircon occurs not only in crystalline rocks of the Río de la Plata craton, but also in small amounts in the metasedimentary Ediacaran to Cambrian Puncoviscana Formation and equivalents and in the discordantly overlying siliciclastic Cambrian Mesón GroupThe Puncoviscana Formation is dominated by detrital zircon with ages of 1.2–1.0 Ga and 670–610 Ma and commonly also 550–520 Ma, as well as some material of c
The amount of Transamazonian zircon grains in the Puncoviscana Formation is much smaller than in the Silurian units in Argentina (Fig5)
Therefore, it is unlikely to have shed large amounts of detritus into the Silurian basinsHence, the Cambrian and Silurian deposits in Argentina represent a different transport system than the one to the west of the Famatinian arc
Hence, the Cambrian and Silurian deposits in Argentina represent a different transport system than the one to the west of the Famatinian arcOrdovician strata in the area of the Eastern Sierras Pampeanas also contain Transamazonian-age zircon grains (La Cébila and Suri formations; Rapela et al
Ordovician strata in the area of the Eastern Sierras Pampeanas also contain Transamazonian-age zircon grains (La Cébila and Suri formations; Rapela et al2007; Verdecchia et al
2009), as well as in Devonian to Permian units at 26–32°S in Chile (Willner et al2008), and in upper Palaeozoic to Triassic strata at 31–52°S (Hervé et al
2008), and in upper Palaeozoic to Triassic strata at 31–52°S (Hervé et al2003, 2013; Augustsson et al
Because of the large north–south extent of the Ordovician arc and its position along the margin of Gondwana it is unsurprising that it was a barrier for transport from the interior of the continent towards the western coastal areaDuring times of active tectonism, sediment from the interior of the continent may have been trapped on the continental side of foreland basins
The arc remained as a combined detritus feeder and detritus barrier from the time of its formation until at least the emergence of the younger magmatic arc during Carboniferous timeContinuous arc erosion is in accordance with estimated exhumation of rocks with Ordovician peak-metamorphic ages and Precambrian protoliths in northern Chile from the Ordovician period until late Palaeozic time (Lucassen et al
Continuous arc erosion is in accordance with estimated exhumation of rocks with Ordovician peak-metamorphic ages and Precambrian protoliths in northern Chile from the Ordovician period until late Palaeozic time (Lucassen et al2000)
It also agrees with slow exhumation rates of <1 mm a−1 until Early Carboniferous time in the Sierras Pampeanas (de los Hoyos et al2011).
The only exception to the feeder–barrier function of the extinct Famatinian arc may have occurred during the Silurian period.Among the Silurian units only the Quebrada Ancha Formation in Chile, with a dominance of Pampean and Famatinian zircon ages, was deposited in a western–central position in relation to the former Famatinian arc
Among the Silurian units only the Quebrada Ancha Formation in Chile, with a dominance of Pampean and Famatinian zircon ages, was deposited in a western–central position in relation to the former Famatinian arcIt contains palaeotransport directions corresponding to transport from the arc (Navarro et al
Both the occurrence of Famatinian arc detritus to the west and the Palaeozoic exhumation estimates are in agreement with continued erosion of the fossil arc during Silurian time (Fig6; Lucassen et al
In this case, the Quebrada Ancha Formation in Chile probably represents only a fragment of a much more extensive, unpreserved north–south-stretching (Late Ordovician to) Silurian sedimentary belt.The Western Sierras Pampeanas have been assumed to be part of the allochthonous Cuyania–Precordillera (e.g
If the southern transport model, which involves zircon transport from the Western Sierras Pampeanas from late Cambrian and throughout Palaeozoic time, is correct, it implies that the Western Sierras Pampeanas were attached to Gondwana, supporting the existence of Arequipa–Pampia (Bahlburg et al2000).
The apparent change in transportation path of Silurian age appeared after the assumed docking of the Cuyania–Precordillera terrane west of the Sierras Pampeanas during Middle to Late Ordovician time (Figs 1 and 6; e.gRamos et al
470 Ma has been taken as evidence for a position in the vicinity of the Famatinian arc during Early to Middle Ordovician time (Fanning et al2004; Thompson et al
Instead, ages of 1.5–1.0 Ga are prevalent in Cambrian to Silurian units (Finney et al2004, 2005; Gleason et al
The Chilenia terrane is estimated to have collided with Gondwana along the western margin of Cuyania–Precordillera during Middle Devonian time (Fig1; e.g
We are not aware of any exposures from Chilenia proper, but Carboniferous to Permian accretionary wedge deposits in the area are marked by ‘Grenvillian’, Brasiliano, Pampean, and Famatinian detrital zircon ages (Willner et al2008; Bahlburg et al
The Silurian shift in apparent transportation paths coincides with the Late Ordovician to early Silurian ice age that caused glaciation in several parts of Gondwana (e.gDíaz-Martínez & Grahn 2007; Ghienne et al
The glacial deposits of the Zapla Formation are chemically more mature than the younger Silurian strata (Abre et al2005)
Marked climatic changes occurred repeatedly during Palaeozoic time, as the South American part of Gondwana was affected by glaciation during both Late Ordovician to early Silurian and Late Devonian to Late Carboniferous timesSimilarly, both the palaeomagnetic and palaeoclimatic apparent polar wander paths for South America indicate continent movement roughly from low to high to low latitudes during Palaeozoic time (Scotese & Barrett 1990; Tomezzoli 2009; Font et al
The scarcity of Transamazonian-age zircon grains in all but the Cambrian and Silurian units may give the impression that, after emergence of the Ordovician Famatinian arc, transport from the continent interior towards its western (south–central Andean) margin took place during Silurian time onlyThis biased view most probably is caused by the sampling of sedimentary rocks in different plate-tectonic and geographical positions, particularly in relation to the Ordovician magmatic arc
This biased view most probably is caused by the sampling of sedimentary rocks in different plate-tectonic and geographical positions, particularly in relation to the Ordovician magmatic arcThe shallow-water Silurian units with continent-interior material were the only ones that were situated in a palaeogeographical position that may have promoted input of large amounts of corresponding detritus
The shallow-water Silurian units with continent-interior material were the only ones that were situated in a palaeogeographical position that may have promoted input of large amounts of corresponding detritusThe arc blocked further sediment transport to the western margin
The difference in age spectra for Silurian units indicates that care must be taken when interpreting zircon age populations from a sedimentary succession in a confined areaDirect comparison of sedimentary units in a temporal perspective may be invalid if the units occur in basins that were situated in different tectonic settings or in different positions in relation to main erosional barriers (but in similar tectonic settings)
Similarly, Krippner & Bahlburg (2013) studied Pleistocene Rhine sand and demonstrated that a complete orogenic cycle (the Alps) can be overlooked with zircon age data.Renewed tectonic activity in the dominant source areas may cause recycling of first-cycle sedimentary rocks with zircon age distributions that are indistinguishable from those of younger, poly-cycle deposits
The age spectra of the Silurian units in the south–central Andes resemble zircon populations of Early Palaeozoic sandstone and quartzite along the north Gondwana margin now exposed in Germany (see Gerdes & Zeh 2006; Bahlburg et al2010)
