We infer that the Lhasa River is an ancient feature that transported sediment to the subduction zone in Late Cretaceous time and persisted during India-Asia collision.et al., 1994; Cai et al., 2012; Orme and Laskowski, 2016; Metcalf and Kapp, 2017, 2019)

Between 105 and 53 Ma, a retroarc fold-andthrust belt developed in the central Lhasa terrane that accommodated >55 percent shortening, creating a relatively high-elevation mountain belt analogous to the modern Andes and Late Cretaceous North American Cordillera (Kapp et al., 2007; Leier et al., 2007)Contemporaneous sedimentary rocks are the primary record of the development of the convergent margin, including the growth of a forearc basin between ca

In addition, DZ geochronology enables comparison of Late Cretaceous sediment transport with that of the modern Tibetan PlateauIf Late Cretaceous sediment transport pathways are analogous to those of the modern drainages, then the simplest interpretation is that the pathway is long-lived, and the Late Cretaceous equivalent is antecedent.

Source 5 age-probability peaks are readily explained by Early Jurassic igneous rocks (i.e., the Zedong arc southeast of Lhasa city), Triassic igneous rocks related to rifting of the Lhasa terrane from Australia (Zhu et al., 2011) or earliest Gangdese arc magmatism (Wang et al., 2018), and Paleozoic to Mesozoic strata of the Lhasa terrane (e.g., Leier et al., 2007; Gehrels et al., 2011)The 220–200 Ma age-probability peaks in the trench basin samples are rare in the forearc basin samples, except for minor occurrences in Lazi group A samples (8/10), all from the Upper Cretaceous Xigaze Group

If correct, sediment must have dispersed across the Gangdese magmatic arc during Late Cretaceous time to reach the trench basin without significant dilution, largely bypassing the forearc basinThese criteria appear to require a broad catchment area in the central-eastern Lhasa terrane, a confined sediment transport pathway across the magmatic arc, and axial transport along the southern Lhasa terrane margin to at least as far west as Dênggar (Fig

The modern Lhasa River fits the first two criteria: It has a large catchment area (32,800 km2; Prasch et al., 2013) in the central-eastern Lhasa terrane that includes the rare Late Triassic exposures, and it flows to the southwest along a constricted fluvial valley (<5 km wide), transecting the Gangdese magmatic arcIt discharges into the Yarlung River,
