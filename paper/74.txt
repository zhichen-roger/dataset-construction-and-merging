Likely water types from which the quartz overgrowths could have precipitated in the Upper Jurassic sandstones are meteoric water, marine water or basinal water, with estimated d18O values respectively of 7 percent (Hamilton et al., 1987; Hudson & Andrews, 1987), 1.2 percent (Shackleton & Kennett, 1975) and +2 to +5 percent (Egeberg &Aagaard, 1989; Wilkinson et al., 1992)
This range in pore-fluid d18O values suggests a mixing of porewater of isotopic composition similar to Upper Jurassic marine water (1.2 percent) with pore-water of isotopic composition similar to Upper Jurassic meteoric water (7 percent)The influence of marine water is feasible since the Brae Formation sandstones are marine deposits
The re-calculated d18O porewater compositions point towards a larger component of Upper Jurassic meteoric water (7 percent; Hamilton et al., 1987; Hudson & Andrews, 1987)Given the mid-fan setting of the sandstones, this seems less likely than the pore-water compositions calculated by using average Th values.
In the oil zone, authigenic quartz precipitated from a mixing of pore-waters with O isotope compositions similar to Upper Jurassic marine and meteoric waterIn the water zone, pore-water O isotope compositions become more enriched in 18O as a result of water-rock reactions
