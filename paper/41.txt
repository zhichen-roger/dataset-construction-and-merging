The Ancestral Lhasa River: A Late Cretaceous trans-arc river that drained the proto–Tibetan PlateauAndrew K
Late Cretaceous trench basin strata were deposited in the subduction zone that consumed Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere along the southern margin of the proto–Tibetan PlateauWe conducted detrital zircon (DZ) U-Pb geochronology on six trench basin samples (n = 1716) collected near Dênggar, Tibet (∼500 km west of Lhasa), to assess the provenance of these rocks and reconstruct Late Cretaceous sediment transport pathways
We conducted detrital zircon (DZ) U-Pb geochronology on six trench basin samples (n = 1716) collected near Dênggar, Tibet (∼500 km west of Lhasa), to assess the provenance of these rocks and reconstruct Late Cretaceous sediment transport pathwaysThey contained DZ ages that point to a unique source around Lhasa city, north of the Late Cretaceous Gangdese magmatic arc
They contained DZ ages that point to a unique source around Lhasa city, north of the Late Cretaceous Gangdese magmatic arcThe modern Lhasa River catchment contains the requisite sources, and its main trunk transects the Gangdese magmatic arc, joining with the Yarlung River at a barbed junction at the India-Asia suture
We infer that the Lhasa River is an ancient feature that transported sediment to the subduction zone in Late Cretaceous time and persisted during India-Asia collision.et al., 1994; Cai et al., 2012; Orme and Laskowski, 2016; Metcalf and Kapp, 2017, 2019)
Between 105 and 53 Ma, a retroarc fold-andthrust belt developed in the central Lhasa terrane that accommodated >55 percent shortening, creating a relatively high-elevation mountain belt analogous to the modern Andes and Late Cretaceous North American Cordillera (Kapp et al., 2007; Leier et al., 2007)Contemporaneous sedimentary rocks are the primary record of the development of the convergent margin, including the growth of a forearc basin between ca
In addition, DZ geochronology enables comparison of Late Cretaceous sediment transport with that of the modern Tibetan PlateauIf Late Cretaceous sediment transport pathways are analogous to those of the modern drainages, then the simplest interpretation is that the pathway is long-lived, and the Late Cretaceous equivalent is antecedent.

We present data (n = 1716) from six DZ samples from Late Cretaceous (ca92–87 Ma) trench basin strata located near the town of Dênggar, ∼500 km west of Lhasa city (Fig
Mesozoic and early Cenozoic igneous rocks of the Lhasa terrane are highlighted due to their importance for detrital zircon provenance analysisXigaze Group forearc basin sample locations are shown in green (Orme et al., 2015; Orme and Laskowski, 2016), whereas Rongmawa Formation (trench basin) samples are shown in pink (this study; Metcalf and Kapp, 2019)
Group A samples display similar age-probability peaks and relative abundance to the trench basin samples, whereas group B is dominated by Early to middle Cretaceous ages (Fig2).
Based on these provenance similarities and Late Cretaceous MDAs for all trench basin samples, we interpret that they comprised an interrelated trench basin (Fig1).
Source 5 age-probability peaks are readily explained by Early Jurassic igneous rocks (i.e., the Zedong arc southeast of Lhasa city), Triassic igneous rocks related to rifting of the Lhasa terrane from Australia (Zhu et al., 2011) or earliest Gangdese arc magmatism (Wang et al., 2018), and Paleozoic to Mesozoic strata of the Lhasa terrane (e.g., Leier et al., 2007; Gehrels et al., 2011)The 220–200 Ma age-probability peaks in the trench basin samples are rare in the forearc basin samples, except for minor occurrences in Lazi group A samples (8/10), all from the Upper Cretaceous Xigaze Group
The 220–200 Ma age-probability peaks in the trench basin samples are rare in the forearc basin samples, except for minor occurrences in Lazi group A samples (8/10), all from the Upper Cretaceous Xigaze GroupBedrock sources for 220–200 Ma ages are rare in the Lhasa terrane
In contrast, the remaining Xigaze Group samples are dominated by Late Jurassic to Paleocene age-probability peaks that are readily explained by more widespread Late Jurassic to Paleocene igneous rocks of the Gangdese magmatic arc (Figs1 and 4).
Trench basin samples and Lazi forearc basin group A samples require a source region with Paleozoic and Mesozoic Lhasa terrane sedimentary rocks and Late Triassic to Early Jurassic igneous rocks (i.e., source 5; Fig2)
If correct, sediment must have dispersed across the Gangdese magmatic arc during Late Cretaceous time to reach the trench basin without significant dilution, largely bypassing the forearc basinThese criteria appear to require a broad catchment area in the central-eastern Lhasa terrane, a confined sediment transport pathway across the magmatic arc, and axial transport along the southern Lhasa terrane margin to at least as far west as Dênggar (Fig
The modern Lhasa River fits the first two criteria: It has a large catchment area (32,800 km2; Prasch et al., 2013) in the central-eastern Lhasa terrane that includes the rare Late Triassic exposures, and it flows to the southwest along a constricted fluvial valley (<5 km wide), transecting the Gangdese magmatic arcIt discharges into the Yarlung River,
