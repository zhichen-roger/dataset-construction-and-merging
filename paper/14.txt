Oligocene–Miocene Kailas basin, southwestern Tibet: Record of postcollisional upper-plate extension in the Indus-Yarlung suture zoneDepartment of Geosciences, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721, USA
Oligocene–early Miocene time along the Indus-Yarlung suture zone in southwestern TibetThe >2.5-km-thick basin-fi lling Kailas Formation consists of a lower coarse-grained proximal conglomerate and more distal fl uvial sandstone member, a lacustrine shale and sandstone member, and an upper redbed clastic member
The Indus-Yarlung suture zone formed when the Indian continental landmass collided with the southern fl ank of Eurasia during late Paleocene– early Eocene time (Besse et al., 1984; Garzanti et al., 1987; Leech et al., 2005; Green et al., 2008)Along much of the length of the suture zone, rocks of the northern (Tethyan) Himalayan thrust belt and ophiolitic mélange were juxtaposed by the south-dipping Great Counter thrust against rocks of the Gangdese magmatic arc complex (Heim and Gansser, 1939; Burg et al., 1987; Yin et al., 1999; Murphy and Yin, 2003)
Resting unconformably upon the Gangdese arc rocks in the footwall of the Great Counter thrust is a several-kilometer-thick middle Cenozoic alluvial-fl uvial-lacustrine deposit (Heim and Gansser, 1939) referred to by several different names locally along the suture zoneAitchison et al
In this paper, we report the results of an investigation of the Oligocene–Miocene Kailas Formation (Cheng and Xu, 1986) along the Indus-Yarlung suture in southwestern Tibet (Fig1A); this unit is the type example of the Gangrinboche conglomerates
The Tibetan Plateau and its southward-fl anking Himalayan rampart have developed in the context of northward subduction of Indian Neotethyan lithosphere beneath the Eurasian plate, climaxing with the early Cenozoic collision between the two continental landmasses (Argand , 1924;GSA Bulletin; July/August 2011; v
The Gangdese arc is a complex of calc-alkaline batholiths and related volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks that formed as a Cordilleran-style magmatic arc along the southern fl ank of the Lhasa terrane in response to subduction of Tethyan oceanic lithosphere from Cretaceous to Eocene time (Allégre et al., 1984; Pan, 1993; Kapp et al., 2007; Pullen et al., 2008); igneous activity within the arc continued during the early stages of the IndoEurasian collisionThe feature that separates the Gangdese arc and related forearc rocks from the Himalayan thrust belt is the Indus-Yarlung suture
Where dated, ophiolitic fragments are J urassic– Cretaceous (Gopel et al., 1984; Zhou et al., 2002; Malpas et al., 2003; Miller et al., 2003; Ziabrev et al., 2003)These ophiolitic rocks were obducted onto the northern Indian margin during Late Cretaceous–Paleocene (Burg and Chen, 1984; Girardeau et al., 1984; Searle et al., 1987; Malpas et al., 2003; Ding et al., 2005) and possibly Eocene (Davis et al., 2002) time
These ophiolitic rocks were obducted onto the northern Indian margin during Late Cretaceous–Paleocene (Burg and Chen, 1984; Girardeau et al., 1984; Searle et al., 1987; Malpas et al., 2003; Ding et al., 2005) and possibly Eocene (Davis et al., 2002) timeThe Tethyan Himalaya is composed of generally southwardverging thrust sheets of unmetamorphosed Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks (Burg et al., 1987; Ratschbacher et al., 1994; Murphy and Yin, 2003), locally disrupted by large domal structures involving mylonitic orthogneiss and paragneiss that were exhumed from midcrustal depths during middle to late Miocene time (Lee et al., 2000, 2004, 2006; Murphy et al., 2002; Lee and Whitehouse, 2007)
The Tethyan Himalaya is composed of generally southwardverging thrust sheets of unmetamorphosed Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks (Burg et al., 1987; Ratschbacher et al., 1994; Murphy and Yin, 2003), locally disrupted by large domal structures involving mylonitic orthogneiss and paragneiss that were exhumed from midcrustal depths during middle to late Miocene time (Lee et al., 2000, 2004, 2006; Murphy et al., 2002; Lee and Whitehouse, 2007)The northward-verging Great Counter thrust is the northernmost major thrust system in the Tethyan Himalaya (Heim and Gansser, 1939; Burg et al., 1987; Ratschbacher et al., 1994; Yin et al., 1999; Murphy and Yin, 2003)
(2002) correlated the Kailas Formation with Upper O ligocene–Lower Miocene clastic rocks that crop out along nearly the entire length of the IndusYarlung suture (e.g., the Qiuwu, Dazhuqu, and Luobusa Formations; see also Yin et al., 1999).At Mount Kailas, the Kailas Formation rests unconformably upon the Gangdese batholith (Gansser, 1964)
Miocene slip on the Karakoram fault offset the rocks of the Ayi Shan ~65 km to the northwest relative to the Kailas Range (Murphy et al., 2000; Valli et al., 2007)Thus, during late  Oligocene–Miocene time, the rocks exposed today in the Ayi Shan were probably located directly beneath the western part of the Kailas Range and were probably experiencing rapid exhumation in the footwall of the Ayi Shan detachment fault (Fig
Thus, during late  Oligocene–Miocene time, the rocks exposed today in the Ayi Shan were probably located directly beneath the western part of the Kailas Range and were probably experiencing rapid exhumation in the footwall of the Ayi Shan detachment fault (Fig5B; Zhang et al., 2010).
during the latest Oligocene and early MioceneOur U-Pb ages are consistent with, but slightly older than, biotite and plagioclase 40Ar/39Ar intercept ages reported by Aitchison et al
The older than 100 Ma ages exhibit peaks in the Late Archean, Mesoproterozoic, Neoproterozoic, and early to middle PaleozoicAlthough some aspects of the older than 100 Ma grain populations resemble documented detrital zircon ages of Lhasa terrane rocks (Leier et al., 2007), statistically rigorous comparison is not possible because of the small numbers of grains in our older than 100 Ma data sets
It is also noteworthy that none of the Kailas detrital zircon age distributions bears much resemblance to detrital zircon age spectra obtained from the Himalayan thrust belt (Parrish and Hodges, 1996; DeCelles et al., 2000, 2004; Gehrels et al., 2003, 2006; Amidon et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2005) or from Cenozoic strata of the central Lhasa terrane (DeCelles et al., 2007a).Modal sandstone compositions in terms of standard ternary diagrams are illustrated in Figure 15
During deposition of the red-bed member, Tethyan source terranes became more important, supplying limestone, sandstone/quartzite, and chert clasts from the Paleozoic-Mesozoic sedimentary succession in the hanging wall of the South Kailas thrust systemThe detrital zircon age spectra are dominated by age clusters that are typical of the Gangdese arc, with peaks in the ca
We also analyzed samples of modern and Quaternary soil carbonate from the Kailas region and from the Nima area in central Tibet (DeCelles et al., 2007b) in order to calibrate a modern baseline relationship between elevation and isotopic values.All carbonate samples were heated at 150 °C for 3 h in vacuo and processed using an automated sample preparation device (Kiel III) attached directly to a Finnigan MAT 252 mass spectrometer at the University of Arizona
The lower δ18Occ values in the Kailas Formation paleosol carbonates compared to those in local modern soils could at fi rst glance be taken to indicate higher paleoelevations in this region during the early MioceneHowever, the most negative modern values of –13‰ to –14.5‰ are actually comparable to ancient values in the –15‰ to –18‰ range after accounting for the modest isotopic effects (~2‰–3‰) of warmer, and largely ice-free conditions in the early Miocene (Shackleton and Kennett, 1975; Zachos et al., 1994; Bowen and Wilkinson, 2002)
However, the most negative modern values of –13‰ to –14.5‰ are actually comparable to ancient values in the –15‰ to –18‰ range after accounting for the modest isotopic effects (~2‰–3‰) of warmer, and largely ice-free conditions in the early Miocene (Shackleton and Kennett, 1975; Zachos et al., 1994; Bowen and Wilkinson, 2002)The higher and more dispersed δ18Occ values in modern soils probably also refl ect the arid modern climate (greater soil evaporation) compared to a more humid early Miocene climate, as suggested by the abundance of organic material in the main body of the Kailas Formation
The higher and more dispersed δ18Occ values in modern soils probably also refl ect the arid modern climate (greater soil evaporation) compared to a more humid early Miocene climate, as suggested by the abundance of organic material in the main body of the Kailas FormationThis difference in climate is fi rmly supported by the carbon isotope results
respiration rates and more plant cover during the early Miocene.Thus, the oxygen isotope data suggest that the paleoelevation of the Kailas Formation during deposition of the red-bed member was essentially the same as the modern elevation (>4500 m)
Barring such tests, several considerations provide some confi dence in the results: The paleosol carbonate nodules we analyzed are uniformly micritic, burial depth in the Kailas red-bed member was probably modest (e.g., less than 2 km), and both our carbon and oxygen isotope results are quite similar to those from early Miocene paleosols at Nima in central Tibet, from which we also concluded that paleoelevations stood at >4500 m at that time (DeCelles et al., 2007b).The measured sections and additional fi eld observations demonstrate that the Kailas Formation coarsens northward toward its basal contact with the Kailas magmatic complex
The timing of extension would be no older than late Oligocene (ca26 Ma) and no younger than slip on the Great Counter thrust, which was completed by ca
Late Oligocene–early Miocene extension in the Kailas basin is consistent with evidence for rapid exhumation in the footwall of the Ayi Shan detachment at that time (Zhang et al., 2010), which would have been located directly beneath the Kailas basin during its development (Fig5B)
the better-known east-west extension that formed north-striking graben in Tibet beginning in late Miocene time (e.g., Harrison et al., 1995; Murphy et al., 2002; Garzione et al., 2003; Kapp and Guynn, 2004; Saylor et al., 2009).The origin of the Kailas basin has remained enigmatic ever since Gansser’s observations were fi rst published (Heim and Gansser, 1939; Gansser, 1964)
Lithofacies in the red-bed member are similar to those in the roughly contemporaneous Nima Basin of central Tibet, which is documented to have been at high paleoelevation by late Oligocene time (DeCelles et al., 2007a, 2007b)The abrupt change from an essentially noncalcareous to a highly calcareous depositional environment in the red-bed member is unlikely to have been simply a matter of changing provenance, because carbonate clasts and calcite cement are also present in the lower part of the Kailas Formation
More thorough paleoaltimetry studies indicate that the Zhada Basin to the west (Saylor et al., 2009), Thakkhola graben to the southeast (Garzione et al., 2000a), and the Oiyug Basin to the east (Currie et al., 2005) were all at high elevation (>4000 m) by middle to late Miocene timeWe infer that the red-bed member of the Kailas Formation was deposited when the Great Counter thrust became active and began to supply sediment from elevated highlands to the south, and the Kailas basin began to structurally invert and gain elevation, culminating in its present very high elevation (~4.7–6.7 km)
The general paucity of clasts derived from the Tethyan Himalaya to the south is remarkable because the Tethyan thrust belt was certainly active during the E ocene–Oligocene (Ratschbacher et al., 1994; Hodges, 2000; Murphy and Yin, 2003; DeCelles et al., 2004; Aikman et al., 2008)(2) We found no evidence for progressive tilting of bedding characterizing contractional growth structures (e.g., Anadòn et al., 1986) in the Kailas Formation, neither in proximity to the South Kailas thrust system, nor along its northern outcrop border where it rests unconformably on top of the Kailas magmatic complex
Defi nitive assessment of the regional signifi cance of midCenozoic extension in the Indus-Yarlung suture zone requires more detailed basin analyses in the Gangrinboche conglomerates.Independent data from sediment provenance, depositional facies, paleontology, biostratigraphy, geochronology, and petrology suggest that the Indo-Eurasia collision occurred during late Paleocene to early Eocene time (e.g., Garzanti et al., 1987; Searle et al., 1987; Rowley, 1998; di Sigoyer et al., 2000; DeCelles et al., 2004; Najman et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2005; Leech et al., 2005; Chung et al., 2005; Green et al., 2008) and that crustal shortening in the Himalayan thrust belt propagated southward from the suture zone beginning at that time

after the youngest known marine sedimentary rocks were deposited (Garzanti et al., 1987; Willems et al., 1996; Rowley,  1998; Zhu et al., 2005; Green et al., 2008), Mediterranean-style, convergent-margin tectonics controlled by relative rates of convergence and subduction provide a useful framework for understanding Oligocene–Miocene extension in the southern part of the Eurasian plate.If Indian continental lithosphere, several hundred kilometers of which could have been underthrust beneath the Lhasa terrane after the initial Eocene hard collision and Neotethyan slab break-off event (e.g., DeCelles et al., 2002; Kohn and Parkinson, 2002; Guillot et al., 2003; Ding et al., 2005; Kapp et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2009), were to begin foundering into the mantle such that a rolling hinge line migrated southward relative to Indian lithosphere (Ding et al., 2003), then the subduction rate would equal the sum of the absolute values of true Indo-Eurasia convergence and the rate of hinge-line rollback

Available data suggest that such a situation existed in the Indus-Yarlung suture zone during the middle CenozoicMolnar and Stock (2009) calculated a middle Cenozoic (ca
Molnar and Stock (2009) calculated a middle Cenozoic (ca45–20 Ma) convergence rate of ~59 mm/yr between northwestern India and Eurasia
during latest Eocene–Oligocene time, the subduction rate would have been ~84 percent greater than the rate of convergenceCapi tanio et al
Early to middle Miocene activation of several major thrust systems in the Himalaya, including the Main Central, Ramgarh, and Great Counter thrusts (which together accommodate at least 300 km of shortening), refl ects this new mode of hard collision.This explanation for the kinematics of the Kailas basin is advantageous because it does not require post-Eocene oceanic subduction outboard of an irregular northern Indian continental margin; it can be reconciled with regional petrologic, metamorphic, structural, and sedimentological data sets; and a drastic revision in the timing of initial Indo-Eurasia collision (Aitchison et al., 2007) is unnecessary

(2010a) noted that the distribution of fast anomalies beneath western Tibet is consistent with two slab break-off events, and their reconstruction suggests that these events were coeval with the events we postulate (Eocene and late Oligocene– early Miocene) based on surface dataSimilar timing of slab break-off and/or lithosphere removal events is derived from petrol ogical studies of Eocene–Miocene igneous rocks in the Lhasa terrane (e.g., Miller et al., 1999; Chung et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2009).
Similar timing of slab break-off and/or lithosphere removal events is derived from petrol ogical studies of Eocene–Miocene igneous rocks in the Lhasa terrane (e.g., Miller et al., 1999; Chung et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2009).Numerous workers have suggested that the development and subsequent exhumation to midcrustal depths of eclogites in the northern Himalayan thrust belt during Eocene time required initial subduction by slab-pull forces, followed by buoyant rise when the Neotethyan oceanic lithospheric slab broke off and foundered into the mantle (Chemenda et al., 2000; O’Brien et al., 2001; Kohn and Parkinson, 2002; de Sigoyer et al., 2000; Guillot et al., 2003; Leech et al., 2005)

Our explanation of middle Ceno zoic tectonics along the Indus-Yarlung suture suggests that a second signifi cant episode of slab break-off occurred during early Miocene timeUnlike the Eocene break-off event, the Miocene event involved continental Indian lithosphere
Unlike the Eocene break-off event, the Miocene event involved continental Indian lithosphereIt is possible that the Indo-Eurasian collisional orogeny operated in two different modes, depending on whether subducted Tethyan/Indian lithosphere was foundering by rollback (soft collision), or underthrusting at low angle beneath Tibet (hard collision; Fig
The Kailas Formation is late Oligocene to early Miocene in age, and was deposited in alluvial-fan, low-sinuosity fl uvial, and deep lacustrine depositional systemsKailas Formation lakes were narrow, deep, and localized along the Indus-Yarlung suture zone
In contrast, the uppermost part of the stratigraphic section contains abundant paleosol carbonate and redbed paleosols, similar to previously documented Oligocene–Miocene lithofacies in the central part of the Tibetan Plateau from which we have obtained carbon and oxygen isotope data that are consistent with very high paleoelevation by late Oligocene timeWe tentatively suggest that the Kailas basin developed at comparatively low elevations until deposition of the uppermost part of the Kailas Formation.
