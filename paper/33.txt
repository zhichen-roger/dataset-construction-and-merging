Recently obtained sedimentological, biostratigraphic, petrographic, geochemical and geochronological data on Cretaceous to Paleogene strata in the Cuojiangding area (Zhongba county, south Tibet) shed new light on the tectonic evolution of the southern margin of the Lhasa Block during closure of Neotethys and initial collision with IndiaThe uppermost Cretaceous Padana and Qubeiya formations, deposited in deltaic to inner shelf environments, and representing the final filling of the Xigaze forearc basin, were unconformably overlain by the Quxia and Jialazi formations, deposited in fan-delta
The uppermost Cretaceous Padana and Qubeiya formations, deposited in deltaic to inner shelf environments, and representing the final filling of the Xigaze forearc basin, were unconformably overlain by the Quxia and Jialazi formations, deposited in fan-deltaenvironments during the Paleocene/earliest Eocene

Petrographic data and U–Pb ages of detrital zircons document the progressive unroofing of the Gangdese arc, which remained the dominant source of detritus throughout the Late Cretaceous to PaleogeneDetrital Cr-spinels in the Quxia and Jialazi formations are geochemically similar to those in Cretaceous Xigaze forearc strata but different from those hosted in Yarlung Zangbo ophiolites, suggesting that the latter were not exposed to erosion in the considered time window
Detrital Cr-spinels in the Quxia and Jialazi formations are geochemically similar to those in Cretaceous Xigaze forearc strata but different from those hosted in Yarlung Zangbo ophiolites, suggesting that the latter were not exposed to erosion in the considered time windowSandstone petrography, Cr-spinel-geochemistry, U–Pb age spectra and Hf isotopic ratios of detrital zircons in the Quxia and Jialazi formations match those in Paleogene sediments deposited on the distal (Sangdanlin and Zheya formations) and proximal Indian margin (Enba and Zhaguo formations), suggesting that the Quxia and Jialazi formations documents syncollisional fan-deltas deposited on top of the nascent Himalayan orogenic belt
Sandstone petrography, Cr-spinel-geochemistry, U–Pb age spectra and Hf isotopic ratios of detrital zircons in the Quxia and Jialazi formations match those in Paleogene sediments deposited on the distal (Sangdanlin and Zheya formations) and proximal Indian margin (Enba and Zhaguo formations), suggesting that the Quxia and Jialazi formations documents syncollisional fan-deltas deposited on top of the nascent Himalayan orogenic beltIn this scenario, the onset of the India–Asia collision predates deposition of the Quxia and Jialazi formations and is thus constrained as younger than 66 Ma and older than 58 Ma.
Cessation of marine sedimentation and first arrival of Asian (Gangdese) detritus on the Indian margin is documented in both Tingri and Saga areas of southern Tibet to have occurred in the Early Eocene (Blondeau et al., 1986; Zhu et al., 2005; Najman et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011; Hu et al.,2012), which confirms a minimum age of ~50 Ma for the India–Asia initial collision, although this age is debated by other researchers (e.g., Wang et al., 2002; Aitchison et al., 2007)
development of a flexural bulge in the outer Indian margin has been constrained biostratigraphically at the Paleocene/Eocene boundary (~56 Ma; Garzanti et al., 1987; Garzanti, 2008)Such an age for collision onset corresponds closely with the onset of India–Asia faunal exchange (occurred at ~54 Ma according to Clementz et al., 2011), with the possible initiation of deformation of the Indian margin (Ratschbacher et al., 1994; Ding et al., 2005), and with the age of NW Himalayan eclogites (Guillot et al., 2003; Leech et al., 2005).
Asian-derived detritus in Paleogene Tethyan Himalayan sandstones (Enba Formation in Tingri and Sangdanlin Formation in Saga) (Zhu et al., 2005; Najman et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2012; JZhang et al., 2012; Q.H
Zhang et al., 2012; DeCelles et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014), however, indicates that at ~55 Ma India collided with the Lhasa Block earlier attached to Eurasia, thus ruling out the idea of a double Cenozoic collisionNo geological evidence of oceanic suturing and collision later than 55 Ma has ever been reported either in the north between the Gangdese arc and the Lhasa Block (DeCelles et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014), or in the south between a “Tethyan Himalayan” terrane and India, as recently suggested by van Hinsbergen et al
Forearc-basin successions displaying the classic shallowing-upward trend from turbidites to shelfal and fluvio-deltaic sediments during the late Early to Late Cretaceous are well developed along the Himalayas (Wang et al., 2012; An et al., 2014; Orme et al., 2015), including the Indus forearc basin in Ladakh (Garzanti and Van Haver, 1988) and the Xigaze forearc basin in South Tibet (Liu et al., 1988; Einsele et al., 1994; Dürr, 1996; Wang et al., 2012; An et al., 2014; Orme et al., 2015) (Fig1).
The Cuojiangding area of the Zhongba county (South Tibet) is one location where Paleogene marine strata at the top of the Cretaceous Xigaze forearc basin are best exposed (e.gLiu et al., 1988; Ding et al., 2005) (Figs
In this study, we combine sedimentological and biostratigraphic data on the Upper Cretaceous to lowermost Eocene succession of the Cuojiangding area, with sandstone petrography, detrital zircon U–Pb geochronology, and detrital Cr-spinel geochemistry to reconstruct the paleotectonic evolution of the southern margin of Asia during transition from Neo-Tethyan subduction to the earliest stages of the India–Asia collision.Fig
The Lhasa Block north of the Gangdese arc includes Paleozoic to Cretaceous strata with volcanic intervals and common Jurassic to Cretaceous igneous rocks (Kapp et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2011)Significant thrusting prior to the India–Asia collision (Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al., 2007) and associated retroarc-foreland-basin development were inferred to have taken place during the Late Cretaceous (Leier et al., 2007a; Sun et al., 2015)
Significant thrusting prior to the India–Asia collision (Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al., 2007) and associated retroarc-foreland-basin development were inferred to have taken place during the Late Cretaceous (Leier et al., 2007a; Sun et al., 2015)The Gangdese magmatic arc (southern Lhasa subterrane) is composed of Late Triassic to Paleogene granitoid batholiths (Chung et al., 2005; Chu et al., 2006; Wen et al., 2008; Ji et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2011), intruding Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata, and unconformably overlain by the Paleogene Linzizong volcanic succession (Mo et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014).
The Gangdese magmatic arc (southern Lhasa subterrane) is composed of Late Triassic to Paleogene granitoid batholiths (Chung et al., 2005; Chu et al., 2006; Wen et al., 2008; Ji et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2011), intruding Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata, and unconformably overlain by the Paleogene Linzizong volcanic succession (Mo et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2009; Zhu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014).The Xigaze forearc basin was filled by turbiditic sandstones and interbedded mudrocks during the Albian to Santonian (Einsele et al., 1994; Dürr, 1996; Wan et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1999, 2012), and by shelfal to deltaic deposits during the Campanian– Maastrichtian (Liu et al., 1988; Wang et al., 2012; An et al., 2014), as described in more detail below.
The Xigaze forearc basin was filled by turbiditic sandstones and interbedded mudrocks during the Albian to Santonian (Einsele et al., 1994; Dürr, 1996; Wan et al., 1998; Wang et al., 1999, 2012), and by shelfal to deltaic deposits during the Campanian– Maastrichtian (Liu et al., 1988; Wang et al., 2012; An et al., 2014), as described in more detail below.The Yarlung Zangbo suture zone marks the contact between India and Asia, and includes ophiolites and tectonic mélange with serpentinite or shale matrix (Cai et al., 2012; Chan et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015).
The southern Tethyan Himalaya is characterized by shallow-water shelf carbonates and terrigenous Paleozoic to Eocene strata (e.gJadoul et al., 1998; Garzanti, 1999; Hu et al., 2010), whereas the northern Tethyan Himalaya is dominated by deeper-water Mesozoic to Paleogene outer shelf, continental slope and rise deposits (X.H
Jadoul et al., 1998; Garzanti, 1999; Hu et al., 2010), whereas the northern Tethyan Himalaya is dominated by deeper-water Mesozoic to Paleogene outer shelf, continental slope and rise deposits (X.HLi et al., 2005).
Biostratigraphic studies dated the Ngamring Formation at the late Albian–Coniacian, and subdivided it into five megasequences (Wan et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2012)Extensive detrital-zircon U–Pb–Hf data confirmed provenance from the Gangdese arc (Wu et al., 2010; Aitchison et al., 2011; Orme et al., 2015)
(2014) documented in detail how sedimentation in the forearc basin began with abyssal cherts of late Barremian–Aptian age in the south (Chongdui Fm.) and reefal limestones of late Aptian–earliest Albian age in the north (Sangzugang Fm.), and how the thick overlying turbidites of the Ngamring Fmare capped by shelfal, deltaic and eventually fluvial sediments of the Padana Formation, documenting the final filling of the basin by Campanian time.
are capped by shelfal, deltaic and eventually fluvial sediments of the Padana Formation, documenting the final filling of the basin by Campanian time.The studied section is located near the glacier lake of Cuojiangding, and geologically belongs to the Xigaze forearc unit (Qian et al., 1982;
1b and 2), the Upper Cretaceous Padana Formation and the overlying Qubeiya Formation are unconformably followed by the Paleogene Quxia and Jialazi formations (Liu et al., 1988; Ding et al., 2005) (Fig3)
nov., indicating a late Campanian ageThe youngest detrital zircon ages of the 09CJD03 sample from the top of the Padana Formation are 74 ± 1 Ma, 75 ± 1 Ma, 76 ± 1 Ma and 79 ± 1 Ma with discordances of 8 percent, 13 percent, 0 percent and 1 percent, respectively
YDZ, YSG and YC1σ ages are also close to 74 Ma (Table 1), consistent with the late Campanian depositional age of the unit.The Qubeiya Formation (~200 m thick in the Quxia A section; Fig
4c, f), bivalves, ammonites, gastropods and crinoids, indicating Maastrichtian age and deposition on the inner shelf (Liu et al., 1988; Sun and Wang, 2001; Wan et al., 2001).In this study we retrieved rich benthic foraminiferal assemblages including Lepidorbitoides minor, L
minor with quadriserial peri-embryonic arrangement and small number of adauxiliary chambers, in association with Orbitoides medius and Omphalocyclus, indicates a late Maastrichtian age (Fig5).
The YDZ, YSG and YC1σ ages are also ~66 Ma (Table 1), which indicates the early Paleocene as the maximum depositional age of the Quxia Formation.The nature and geometry of the stratigraphic contact between the Qubeiya Formation and the overlying Quxia Formation remains uncertain because of poor outcrop conditions
Abundant fossils include larger benthic foraminifera, bivalves, gastropods and corals of Paleocene to early Eocene age (Liu et al., 1988; Wan et al., 2001).In the lower Jialazi Formation (unit 15 of the Quxia section), larger benthic foraminiferal assemblages including Daviesina langhami, Lockhartia haimei, L
conditi, Ranikothalia bermudezi and Smoutina cruysi indicate the late Paleocene (early Thanetian, late SBZ3 zone of Serra-Kiel et al., 1998)The foraminiferal assemblages that we retrieved from the overlying units 16–18 are dominated by the larger benthic foraminifera Miscellanea yvettae, M
This varied fauna indicates a latest Paleocene age (late Thanetian, SBZ 4 zone, late P4 zone; 57–56 Ma).In the upper Jialazi Formation (units 24–25 of the Quxia section and the Jialazi section), larger benthic foraminifera include Assilina leymeriei, A
sibetica, indicating an earliest Eocene age (Ypresian; SBZ5 zone; early P5 zone; 56–55 Ma) (Fig5)
Cr-spinels were found throughout Upper Cretaceous and Paleogene strata in the Cuojiangding area (Appendix Table 3)In the Padana Formation they have Mg# [Mg/(Mg+Al)] value between 0.29 and 0.61, with corresponding Cr# [Cr/(Cr+Al)] varying from 0.49 to 0.71 (0.87 in one grain)
It is noteworthy that Crspinels from the Paleogene Quxia and Jialazi formations are similar to those in Cretaceous Xigaze forearc strata, but distinct from those in Yarlung Zangbo ophiolites (see Hu et al., 2014 and references therein) (Fig8).
Zircons are all Cretaceous in age (104–74 Ma), excepting one Mesoproterozoic grain (1200 ± 13 Ma with discordance of 0.1 percent)The main age clusters are around 84 Ma and 92 Ma (Fig
Most zircons (94 percent) are Cretaceous in age (100–65.5 Ma), but 5 percent are Jurassic (163– 146 Ma) and one Neoproterozoic (775 ± 10 Ma) (Fig9)
Among them, 76 percent (n = 96) are Jurassic to Paleogene and mainly fall into three groups: 54–70 Ma (n = 14), 72–128 Ma (n = 69) and 147–186 Ma (n = 10) (Fig9; Table 1)
Pre-Ordovician zircons are also common (23 percent; n = 29) and define four clusters: 503–555 Ma (n = 4), 877–1299 Ma (n = 14), 1427–1667 Ma (n = 6), 1817–1828 Ma (n = 2), with oldest grains of 2513 Ma and 2142 Ma (Fig9)
Biostratigraphic and geochronological dating converge to indicate conclusively that deposition of the Jialazi Formation took place very close to the Paleocene/Eocene boundaryThe weighted-mean plateau whole-rock 40Ar/39Ar ages of 62.6 ± 0.6 Ma and 62.0 ± 1.0 Ma from the two tuff layers in the lower Jialazi Formation and a weighted-mean zircon U–Pb age of 62.0 ± 2.2 Ma from one tuff sample (n = 11; Ding et al., 2005) are only apparently in contrast with the youngest age peak of 54.9 ± 0.7 Ma that we have obtained, because the weighted age in Ding et al
However, youngest detrital-zircon U–Pb ages indicate a maximum deposition age of 66 Ma (Maastrichitian– Danian boundary) for the Quxia Formation, which is coherent with the late Maastrichtian age of the underlying Qubeiya FormationThe minimum age of the Quxia Formation is constrained by the deposition age of the overlying lower Jialazi Formation, containing larger benthic foraminifera of late SBZ3 (58–57 Ma) age in unit 15 of the Quxia section
Potential sources of Cr-spinel in the Gangdese region include: 1) the Xietongmen ultramafic and mafic rock suite of debated origin, found 10 km north of the Xigaze forearc basin (Gao et al., 2003; Li et al., 2003); 2) the E/W trending and ≥60 km long Sumdo ultramafic eclogite belt of Permian age, exposed in the eastern Lhasa Block and interpreted as a dismembered ophiolite (Chen et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2009)Cr-spinels in the Quxia and Jialazi formations are unlikely to have been recycled from uplifted Cretaceous Xigaze forearc strata (Ngamring and Padana formations), because very few sandstone pebbles occur in the Quxia conglomerate, and sedimentary lithic grains (Fig
Cr-spinels in the Quxia and Jialazi formations are unlikely to have been recycled from uplifted Cretaceous Xigaze forearc strata (Ngamring and Padana formations), because very few sandstone pebbles occur in the Quxia conglomerate, and sedimentary lithic grains (Fig7b) are quite rare in Quxia and Jialazi sandstones.
The Padana sandstones were derived mostly from Cretaceous volcanic rocks of the largely undissected Gangdese arc in the southern Lhasablock, as indicated by dominant volcanic rock fragments (Fig
Beside zircons of Cretaceous age (100–65.5 Ma), a few Jurassic zircons appear (5 percent between 146 and 163 Ma), suggesting deepening of erosion into Jurassic magmatic rocks of the arc massifVolcanic grains decrease further in the Jialazi sandstones, where quartz increases at the expense of feldspars and detrital zircons display a much wider age range (76 percent between 54 and 186 Ma, 23 percent older than Ordovician)
Volcanic grains decrease further in the Jialazi sandstones, where quartz increases at the expense of feldspars and detrital zircons display a much wider age range (76 percent between 54 and 186 Ma, 23 percent older than Ordovician)We can thus safely conclude that the Jialazi Formation was derived not only from Jurassic to Paleogene arc rocks, but also from much older siliciclastic rocks of the Lhasa terrane, where Pre-Ordovician zircons occur in abundance (Leier et al., 2007b)
We can thus safely conclude that the Jialazi Formation was derived not only from Jurassic to Paleogene arc rocks, but also from much older siliciclastic rocks of the Lhasa terrane, where Pre-Ordovician zircons occur in abundance (Leier et al., 2007b)Our data thus robustly document progressive unroofing of the Gangdese arc and Lhasa block, from undissected stage in the latest Cretaceous (Padana Formation), to partially dissected stage in the Paleocene (Quxia formations), and final transition to dissected stage close to the Paleocene/Eocene boundary (Jialazi Formation).
Our data thus robustly document progressive unroofing of the Gangdese arc and Lhasa block, from undissected stage in the latest Cretaceous (Padana Formation), to partially dissected stage in the Paleocene (Quxia formations), and final transition to dissected stage close to the Paleocene/Eocene boundary (Jialazi Formation).The Sangdanlin succession of the northern Tethyan Himalaya (exposed in fault contact with the surrounding mélange near Saga, ~25 km south of the Yarlung Zangbo ophiolites; Fig
11), overlain by 40–50 m-thick red cherty mudrocks of Paleocene age (Ding, 2003; Wang et al., 2011; DeCelles et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014)Above, the 125-m-thick Paleocene Sangdanlin Formation (Ding, 2003; DeCelles et al., 2014) includes quartzo-lithic volcaniclastic turbidites containing chert, shale/siltstone and phyllite grains, overlain by similar quartzo-lithic volcaniclastic turbidites interbedded with gray mudrocks and cherts (Zheya Formation; Wang et al., 2011)
Above, the 125-m-thick Paleocene Sangdanlin Formation (Ding, 2003; DeCelles et al., 2014) includes quartzo-lithic volcaniclastic turbidites containing chert, shale/siltstone and phyllite grains, overlain by similar quartzo-lithic volcaniclastic turbidites interbedded with gray mudrocks and cherts (Zheya Formation; Wang et al., 2011)U–Pb age spectra displayed by detrital zircons in both Sangdanlin and Zheya formations indicate provenance from the Lhasa terrane (Wang et al., 2011; DeCelles et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014).
1a), the lower Eocene terrigenous Enba Formation (Wang et al., 2002) overlies shallow-water limestones of the Zongpu Formation with slightly angular disconformity (Hu et al., 2012; Fig11) and is largely derived from Gangdese arc rocks of the Asian margin (Wang et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2005; Najman et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2012)
The age of the Enba Formation is constrained by calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifera as early Eocene (53.5–50.4 Ma; zones NP11–12 and P7–8; Zhu et al., 2005; Najman et al., 2010).Very similar framework petrography (Fig
The Paleogene Quxia and Jialazi formations, overlying the uppermost Cretaceous Padana and Qubeya formations (Fig12a), may be interpreted either as the continuation of the Xigaze forearc succession (Model 1; Fig
According to this interpretation, the supposedly angular unconformity between the Qubeiya and Quxia formations and the sedimentological changes within the Quxia and Jialazi formations must have resulted from changes in the dynamics of Neo-Tethyan oceanic subduction, as other unconformities documented in forearc basins worldwide (e.g., Neogene Cascadia forearc in western North America; McNeill et al., 2000; Cretaceous Yezo forearc in Japan; Ando and Tomosugi, 2005)The Qubeiya/Quxia unconformity, corresponding to a time gap potentially including much of Paleocene time (66–58 Ma), may be correlated with the angular unconformity between strongly deformed Mesozoic strata and overlying Linzizong volcanic succession in south
The Qubeiya/Quxia unconformity, corresponding to a time gap potentially including much of Paleocene time (66–58 Ma), may be correlated with the angular unconformity between strongly deformed Mesozoic strata and overlying Linzizong volcanic succession in southSerra-Kiel et al
This is the scenario favored here, based on the following geological evidence: 1) dramatic change from shallow shelf environments (Qubeiya Formation) to debris-flow sedimentation in fan-delta settings (Quxia Formation; Liu et al., 1988; Ding et al., 2005); 2) increasing supply from Paleozoic rocks of the Lhasa continental margin as recorded by appearance of abundant zircons older than the Ordovician in the Jialazi Formation, indicating accelerated erosional unroofing of the southern Lhasa block; 3) palynofloral assemblages in the Quxia Formation (with a climax of bisaccate pollens typical of conifers living in cool mountain areas; Li et al., 2008), indicating considerable elevation of the Gangdese arc; 4) provenance similarities of the Quxia and Jialazi formations with the Sangdanlin and Zheya formations of the northern Tethys Himalaya (Wang et al., 2011; DeCelles et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014) and with the Enba and Zhaguo formations of the southern Tethys Himalaya (G.BLi et al., 2005; Hu et al., 2012; Q.H
The uncertainty remains on the origin of environmental change close to the Paleocene/Eocene boundary from proximal fan-delta deposition dominated by debris-flow conglomerates to distal fan-delta shallow-marine sedimentationThis transgression may reflect either regional tectonic causes or possibly even global eustatic control associated with latest Paleocene–early Eocene greenhouse warming (Zachos et al., 2008).
This transgression may reflect either regional tectonic causes or possibly even global eustatic control associated with latest Paleocene–early Eocene greenhouse warming (Zachos et al., 2008).Integrated stratigraphic, sedimentological, petrographic, geochronological and geochemical data on the uppermost Cretaceous to Paleogene succession exposed in the Cuojiangding area of southern Tibet allowed us to unravel the tectonic events immediately preceding and associated with the earliest evolution of the Himalayan Orogen
Integrated stratigraphic, sedimentological, petrographic, geochronological and geochemical data on the uppermost Cretaceous to Paleogene succession exposed in the Cuojiangding area of southern Tibet allowed us to unravel the tectonic events immediately preceding and associated with the earliest evolution of the Himalayan OrogenThe deltaic Padana Formation and the overlying inner-shelf Qubeiya Formation document the filling stage of the Xigaze forearc basin at the close of the Cretaceous
The deltaic Padana Formation and the overlying inner-shelf Qubeiya Formation document the filling stage of the Xigaze forearc basin at the close of the CretaceousA tectonic event is testified by the Quxia and overlying Jialazi formations, deposited in fan-delta settings
A latest Paleocene–earliest Eocene age (57–54 Ma) for the Jialazi Formation is robustly constrained by foraminiferal assemblages and radiometric dating of interbedded tuff layers.Sandstone petrography, paleocurrents, U–Pb age spectra and Hf isotopic ratios of detrital zircons indicate provenance from the Gangdese arc throughout the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene, with rapid unroofing of its plutonic roots during deposition of the Quxia Formation
Sandstone petrography, paleocurrents, U–Pb age spectra and Hf isotopic ratios of detrital zircons indicate provenance from the Gangdese arc throughout the Late Cretaceous to Paleogene, with rapid unroofing of its plutonic roots during deposition of the Quxia FormationErosion finally cut into deeper-seated older rocks of the Lhasa Block during deposition of the Jialazi Formation
Detrital Cr-spinels from the Upper Cretaceous to Paleogene succession in Cuojiangding area compare well with those contained in Xigaze forearc strata but poorly with those in Yarlung Zangbo ophiolites, confirming provenance from the Lhasa terrane.The dramatic change from shelfal sedimentation in the latest Cretaceous (Padana and Qubeiya formations) to fan-delta sedimentation in the Paleocene/Eocene (Quxia and Jialazi formations), and the close affinity in sandstone petrography, Cr-spinel geochemistry, U–Pb ages and Hf ratios of detrital zircons in the Jialazi Formation and both Sangdanlin + Zheya formations of the northern Tethys Himalaya and Enba + Zhaguo formations of the southern Tethys Himalaya testify in favor of paleogeographic Model 2
