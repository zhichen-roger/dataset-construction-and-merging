The California arc formed as a consequence of prolonged Mesozoic subduction beneath the former passive margin of western North America (Saleeby et al., 1992)The arc is composed of a northern, continent-fringing arc segment primarily exposed in the Sierra Nevada, and a southern, continental arc segment exposed in the Salinian Block, Mojave Desert, and Transverse Ranges

The Cretaceous intrusive history of this arc has been intensely studied, but questions remain for the arc as a whole, which can be addressed from the detrital recordSignifi cant ambiguities include the interplay between prolonged subduction and the apparent pulsed nature of magmatism, and the petrogenetic relationships between exposed plutons and volcanic rocks now largely removed by erosion.

About a third of the detrital zircons yield Archean to Mesoproterozoic ages, indicating that sediment was derived from the continental segment of the arc.In order to systematically compare melt compositions through time in detrital zircons derived from variably fractionated zircon suites, we grouped arc-derived detrital zircons within 10 m.y

Long-term high Th/U is a characteristic of the Proterozoic crustal framework of the continental segment of the California arc (Wooden and Miller, 1990), so the relatively high Th/U that characterizes magmatic pulses suggests enhanced involvement of fertile crustal rocks during times of high magma production (Ducea and Barton, 2007)Hughes and Mahood (2008) showed that caldera-forming eruptions indicative of voluminous magmatism in modern arc crust are associated with moderately high normal convergence rates and are favored in compressional upper plate settings, consistent with our suggestion that pulse magmas record crustal involvement above that of the background magma fl ux

Low U/Yb in Jurassic time may record reduced ingress of slab-derived fl uid, which when coupled with low Th/U and high Yb/Gd indicates that minimal crustal involvement may be related to phases of large-scale extension or transtension during l1 compared to l2 (Saleeby et al., 1992)Additional detrital records of this type, particularly longitudinal transects that compare forearc to retro-arc records, are likely to provide higher-resolution records of melt variations and greater insights into the evolution of this long-lived, asymmetrical continental and continent-fringing arc system.
