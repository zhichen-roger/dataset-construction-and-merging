Successions preserved in eastern North America indicate that Cambrian to early Ordovician oceanic volcanic arcs and suprasubduction ophiolites were obducted and accreted onto Laurentia (Baie Verte Oceanic Tract), followed by subduction-polarity flip and development of the 488–456 Ma Notre Dame magmatic arc within the Laurentian accretionary margin (van Staal et al1998, and references therein)

It has been generally believed that Connemara arrived in its outboard position to the south of the South Mayo Trough by post-460 Ma strike-slip terrane amalgamation, to provide a southern sediment source of metamorphic clasts for the late Ordovician or early Silurian Derryveeny Formation (Hutton 1987; Graham et al1991)

The observation that the upper Bunnacunneen sample has an older Ordovician maximum than the basal sample is considered to represent unroofing of the Connemara–Notre Dame arc and concomitant supply of material containing older zircons.The Archaean and Proterozoic grains in all samples are consistent with a Laurentian source (Cawood et al

The southern provenance from a terrane with Notre Dame arc and Laurentian signatures suggests that the Connemara terrane lay to the south of the South Mayo Trough during middle Ordovician times.The U–Pb zircon age of 470.6  1.0 Ma, the geochemical similarity of the Bunnacunneen granite clasts to the Connemara granitic orthogneisses, and the southerly position of the orthogneisses and the likely southerly derivation of the clasts, suggest that rocks related to the orthogneiss suite were the source of the clasts
