These data support the view that the Shiqiao–Pingshang low-grade metasedimentary rocks originated from the North China Craton, and underwent deformation in the Permian during subduction of the South China Craton (Yangtze block) beneath the North China CratonThis requires that the low-grade metasedimentary rocks were overthrust for several tens of kilometres onto the South China Craton, explaining why source materials from the North China Craton are common in Triassic to Jurassic sedimentary basins
This requires that the low-grade metasedimentary rocks were overthrust for several tens of kilometres onto the South China Craton, explaining why source materials from the North China Craton are common in Triassic to Jurassic sedimentary basinsThe Sulu ultrahigh-pressure (UHP) metamorphic terrane is part of the Qinling–Dabie–Sulu orogenic belt in east–central China (Fig
1a) and represents a continent–continent collisional orogen that evolved from the Permian to Triassic (Yin & Nie 1993; Hacker et al2000; Ratschbacher et al
2005) because zircon U–Pb protolith ages of 760  9 to 802  3 Ma and whole-rock Rb–Sr isochron ages of 232  8 Ma for metamorphism obtained from these rocks are equivalent to the Neoproterozoic protolith and Triassic metamorphic ages of the UHP rocks in the Dabie– Sulu belt (Dong et al1997; Schmid et al
The UHP metamorphism at Sulu occurred in the middle Triassic at 240–220 Ma, based on Sm–Nd, U–Pb and Ar–Ar investigations (Li et al1993, 2000; Ames et al
Recent SHRIMP U–Pb zircon and Ar–Ar dates show that the HP metamorphism at Sulu took place in the Late Permian at c253 Ma, reflecting the onset of subduction of the South China Craton beneath the North China Craton (Xu et al
(3) Late Neoproterozoic–Cambrian algal fossils have been found in the Shiqiao–Pingshang low-grade metasedimentary rocks (SBGMR 1987, 1997), and a Late Neoproterozoic (Sinian) age of 620  14 Ma was obtained from phyllite by the whole-rock Rb–Sr method (Song & Song 1997).Analyses of major element oxides and trace elements were carried out at the Analytical Institute in the Hubei Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources, Wuhan
Importantly, no Neoproterozoic ages were identified in the zircon populations of either sample, even though the metasedimentary rocks were deposited during the Sinian (Late Neoproterozoic) and in the Sulu area at the northern margin of the South China Craton.Fig

The basement rocks of the North China Craton and South China Craton record very different thermal–magmatic histories prior to amalgamation in the Early Mesozoic (Bruguier et al1997; Hacker et al
In the North China Craton, Precambrian basement rocks are dominated by Neoarchaean granitoids and orthogneisses (mostly tonalite–trondhjemite–granodiorite) and Palaeoproterozoic metasedimentary sequences (Jahn & Zhang 1984; Jahn & Ernst 1990; Zhao et al2000, 2002, 2005; Kusky & Li 2003; Zhai & Liu 2003; Wilde & Zhao 2005; Wilde et al
The South China Craton, especially the Yangtze block, is characterized by young basement with Meso- to Neoproterozoic agesThis was subjected to major thermal events at 1100–1000 and 850–700 Ma (Li, Z
Precambrian basement in the South China Craton is characterized by the widespread occurrence of 820–740 Ma bimodal igneous rocks that evolved in a rift setting (Hacker et al1998, 2000; Li, Z
Therefore, Neoproterozoic rift magmatism is regarded as an important signature in distinguishing the South China Craton from the North China Craton (Hacker et al1998, 2000; Ratschbacher et al
Based on this and the fact that Neoproterozoic magmatic ages are absent in the Shiqiao–Pingshang low-grade metasedimentary rocks, although they are located in the Sulu UHP belt, we conclude that the most likely source for the Shiqiao–Pingshang low-grade metasedimentary rocks is from the southern edge of North China Craton, rather than the northern edge of the South China Craton.Relationship between low-grade metamorphic and UHP rocks
On the other hand, Neoproterozoic ages between 650 and 850 Ma are common in the UHP rocks, but are absent in the Shiqiao–Pingshang low-grade metasedimentary rocks(5) New SHRIMP zircon U–Pb dates show that the peak of UHP metamorphism was between 240 and 220 Ma (Leech et al
However, there is no evidence to show that they underwent Triassic UHP metamorphism from either SHRIMP zircon or Ar– Ar muscovite dating.The age of 265 Ma for muscovite from the quartz schist at Shiqiao has not previously been recorded from the Sulu UHP belt
To test this hypothesis, it is necessary to examine data from the various Triassic to Jurassic sedimentary basins that developed around the Dabie–Sulu beltThe presence of coesite- and diamond-bearing UHP metamorphic rocks in the Dabie–Sulu belt suggests that a huge crustal section was buried, uplifted and then denuded (Nie et al
Most material eroded from the Dabie–Sulu belt appears to have accumulated in the Triassic Songpan–Ganzi Basin (Nie et al1994, 1995; Bruguier et al
1a), although some material also accumulated in several Jurassic–Cretaceous sedimentary basins that evolved around the Dabie–Sulu belt during postcollisional exhumation (Grimmer et al2003; Li, R
For the middle to late Triassic Songpan–Ganzi Basin (Fig1a), volumetric comparisons between the basin fill and the amount of material removed to exhume the UHP rocks (Nie et al
In the Jurassic to Cretaceous Hefei Basin and the Jurassic foreland Qianshan Basin (Fig1a), adjacent to the Dabie–Sulu belt, most sediments were also derived from the UHP orogen (Grimmer et al
The provenance of the Jurassic sediments is also a key issue in constraining the evolution and palaeogeographical reconstruction of HP–UHP rocksIn the Hefei Basin, Li, R
(2005) reported that the major component in the Jurassic sediments was derived from the exhumed Dabie beltZircon ages from 2700– 1890 Ma were present though not abundant (Fig
One problem is to explain why so much North China Craton source material is found in these basins and why so few materials are from the UHP rocks, especially in the Triassic Songpan– Ganzi BasinMaterial from the Dabie–Sulu orogenic belt, involving erosion of the UHP rocks, would be expected to mainly provide 740–780 and 220–240 Ma detrital zircons, but this is not the case
The rocks of North China Craton affinity would thus overlie the orogen and these were the first materials to be eroded during Triassic to Jurassic time and therefore provided most of the material fill in the Triassic to Jurassic basins.A tectonic model of continental subduction in the Dabie– Sulu belt
the Shiqiao– Pingshang low-grade metasedimentary rocks) and other rocks of North China Craton affinity (now eroded and deposited in the Triassic–Jurassic basins; Nie et al1994, 1995; Bruguier et al
Most became detritus that was transported into the Middle–Late Triassic Songpan–Ganzi Basin (Nie et al1994; Bruguier et al
Thus, detrital zircons with ages of 2700–1900 Ma are of North China Craton affinity and are now found in these Mesozoic basins.Post-collisional denudation (,200 Ma) (Webb et al
Erosion continued and the detritus was transported into the evolving Jurassic basins adjacent to the Dabie–Sulu belt (Fig1a) (Grimmer et al
As a result, detrital zircons recording the age of both UHP metamorphism and the North China Craton source can be found in the Jurassic Qianshan and Hefei basins (Fig10e)
Most overthrust North China Craton rocks were denuded between the Triassic and the present day, and only a small portion was preserved owing to their being tectonically interleaved with the UHP rocksAs a result, the remaining rocks of North China Craton affinity occur as the Shiqiao–Pingshang low-grade metasedimentary unit in the Dabie–Sulu UHP belt, in tectonic contact with the UHP rocks (Fig
Neoproterozoic (Sinian) low-grade metamorphic rocks (Shiqiao– Pingshang low-grade metasedimentary rocks) occur at Shiqiao and Pingshang, in the Sulu UHP belt, and consist of metasandstone, phyllite, slate, quartzite and quartz schistThe major and trace element data indicate deposition in a passive margin basin at the southern edge of the North China Craton
This explains why the Shiqiao– Pingshang low-grade metasedimentary rocks are interleaved with UHP rocks and why North China Craton source materials are common in the Triassic to Jurassic basins adjacent to the Dabie– Sulu belt, especially in the Songpan–Ganzi Basin.This study was funded by grants from the Natural Science Foundation of China (40272100, 40672148 and 40739905)
