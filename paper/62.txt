Here we assess the redox mineralization of copper and lead selenide phases in the cores of reduction spheroids in Devonian sedimentary red bedsWe propose that the selenide mineralization occurred as descending meteoric fluids, supplied with selenium from Carboniferous coal seams, migrated through a major fault plane into underlying sandstones where localized, microbially-induced reducing conditions prevailed

The geology of the island is dominated by KBF sandstone, with the overlying younger Lower Carboniferous strata on the SW of the islandTwo distinct sets of dykes transect the island: ENE–WSW-trending doleritic and tholeiitic dykes of late Carboniferous age, and NW–SE-trending Palaeogene basaltic–andesitic dykes related to the Mull Dyke Swarm (Monro 1999)
Two distinct sets of dykes transect the island: ENE–WSW-trending doleritic and tholeiitic dykes of late Carboniferous age, and NW–SE-trending Palaeogene basaltic–andesitic dykes related to the Mull Dyke Swarm (Monro 1999)Several minor faults occur on Great Cumbrae, and the major Great Cumbrae Fault (GCF) runs approximately NNE–SSW through the centre of the island (Fig
The Carboniferous strata that occur on Great Cumbrae are restricted to the Kinneswood Formation and Clyde Sandstone Formation, exposed on the SW of the island around Kames Bay (Fig1)
Occurrences range from the mid-Proterozoic (Spinks et al2010) and throughout the Phanerozoic, but they are widely present in Permo-Triassic sandstones (Hofmann 1990, 1991)

In Scotland there are several documented examples of red beds containing reduction spheroids: in the Mesoproterozoic Stoer Group of Stoer Bay (Spinks et al2010); the Neoproterozoic Torridon Group of Rubha Réidh north of Gairloch (Spinks 2012); the Devonian Lower Old Red Sandstone of Gamrie (Van Panhuys-Sigler et al
2010); the Neoproterozoic Torridon Group of Rubha Réidh north of Gairloch (Spinks 2012); the Devonian Lower Old Red Sandstone of Gamrie (Van Panhuys-Sigler et al1996) and Easter Ross (Parnell 1985; Parnell & Eakin 1987); the Carboniferous of North Berwick (Hofmann 1993); and the Triassic of Gruinard Bay (Evans 1982; Spinks 2012).
1996) and Easter Ross (Parnell 1985; Parnell & Eakin 1987); the Carboniferous of North Berwick (Hofmann 1993); and the Triassic of Gruinard Bay (Evans 1982; Spinks 2012).Reduction spheroids form in red beds as a result of secondary reduction of the haematite or goethite which coats the clastic grains
Recent studies have attributed the formation of reduction spheroids and core mineralization to the presence of microbial activity in both Proterozoic and Phanerozoic red beds (Spinks et al2010)
Isotopic fractionation of the sulphur species in pyritic cores of reduction spheroids in Triassic red beds indicates microbial formation (Spinks et al2010)
The earliest movements of the GCF likely occurred in the Late Devonian or Early Carboniferous, with repeated reactivation on a kilometre scale up to and including the emplacement of the Hebridean Igneous Province in the Palaeogene (Young & Caldwell 2013)Selenide mineralization also occurs close to faults and between the Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous strata elsewhere in the Midland Valley
Selenide mineralization also occurs close to faults and between the Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous strata elsewhere in the Midland ValleyMercury and silver-bismuth selenides are present as inclusions in pyrobitumen (Parnell 1988b) along the fault zone of the Ochil Fault between Lower Devonian volcanics and Carboniferous Coal Measures near alva, Scotland (Hall et al
Mercury and silver-bismuth selenides are present as inclusions in pyrobitumen (Parnell 1988b) along the fault zone of the Ochil Fault between Lower Devonian volcanics and Carboniferous Coal Measures near alva, Scotland (Hall et al1982).
The pre-volcanic Carboniferous stratigraphy in the Firth of Clyde area is complex and is characterized by a series of fault-bound micro-basinsThe Kinneswood Formation that overlies the mineralized reduction spheroid-bearing Upper Devonian KBF sandstone (Fig
The Kinneswood Formation that overlies the mineralized reduction spheroid-bearing Upper Devonian KBF sandstone (Fig2) on Great Cumbrae and regionally, contains numerous beds of both dark grey organicrich, and red mudstones (Paterson et al
Coal-bearing Carboniferous strata nearby on NE arran have been reddened, likely during the Permo-Triassic, to a depth of around 180 m (Bailey 1926; Wang 1992), and some coal beds in ayrshire on the mainland have been extensively reddened (Mykura 1960)Like the reddening of organic-rich facies close to selenide ore veins (Stanley et al
2002), the reddening of Carboniferous strata in the Firth of Clyde area may indicate the mobilization of a source of selenium, with subsequent migration and mineralization in a reducing environment.Selenium-enriched mudstones and coals of the Lower Carboniferous may thus have provided a source of selenium and/or metallic cations to the underlying Devonian sandstones in highly oxidized surface waters, allowing mineralization of the reduction spheroid cores via microbial reduction
Selenium-enriched mudstones and coals of the Lower Carboniferous may thus have provided a source of selenium and/or metallic cations to the underlying Devonian sandstones in highly oxidized surface waters, allowing mineralization of the reduction spheroid cores via microbial reductionThe selenium content of soils associated with the Old Red Sandstone in Scotland is expected to be low (Sharman 1960), emphasizing the anomalous nature of the selenium-bearing occurrence in Cumbrae
1000 ppm of selenium are present in copper minerals in Devonian red beds in SW Ireland (Coghlan et al1963)
2007), and the selenide mineralization in the Ochil Fault between the Carboniferous Coal Measures and Lower Devonian volcanic rocks suggest that selenium-rich fluids migrated into the Old Red Sandstone on a regional scaleThe likely source of the uranium in the reduction spheroid cores was also in the organic-rich lithologies
The highly oxidizing meteoric water needed for selenium mobilization, transportation and subsequent mineralization could have been generated as a consequence of the high atmospheric oxygen concentration during the Carboniferous and Permian (Holland 2006).Copper and lead selenide mineralization in the cores of reduction spheroids on Great Cumbrae occurred as a result of localized microbially-induced reducing conditions within the host sandstones, similar to those observed in roll-front uranium deposits
The presence of selenides associated with the junction between Devonian and Carboniferous strata at several localities in the British Isles may suggest a widespread selenium mineralization system in rocks of that age.The authors would like to thank Clive Rice for supplying control samples from argentina, Chris Stanley and Richard Pattrick for constructive comments that improved the manuscript.
