Abstract: Avalonia is the largest accreted crustal block in the Appalachian orogen and comprises a collection of late Neoproterozoic volcano-sedimentary sequences that are overlain by a Palaeozoic platformal sedimentary successionDetrital zircons from the Conception Group are dominated by 570–620 Ma ages and contain a significant component generated by erosion of coeval igneous arc-volcanic rocks
Overlying samples from the Cuckold and Crown Hill formations are dominated by Neoproterozoic populations with ages between 600 and 650 Ma and are interpreted to be derived from the underlying calc-alkaline arc-plutonic rocksEarly Palaeozoic platform units are dominated by c
620 Ma zircons with lesser Mesoproterozoic and Palaeoproterozoic zirconsThe range of detrital zircon ages is inconsistent with a West African provenance and suggests that Avalonia originated along the Gondwanan margin of the Amazon craton
The influx of Mesoproterozoic and Palaeoproterozoic detritus in the Avalonian platform suggests a major change in tectonic regimeThe prominent change in provenance is interpreted to be related to separation of Avalonia from Gondwana during the Early Ordovician opening of the Rheic Ocean
The prominent change in provenance is interpreted to be related to separation of Avalonia from Gondwana during the Early Ordovician opening of the Rheic OceanThe Redmans Formation is interpreted to represent the rift–drift transition of the Rheic Ocean, which imposes important constraints on the palaeotectonic evolution of Avalonia.
Avalonia is the largest accreted crustal block in the Appalachian–Caledonian orogen and comprises Neoproterozoic–early Palaeozoic magmatic arc and sedimentary cover sequences that can be traced from the British Caledonides in England SW to Rhode Island (Fig1)
Lithostratigraphic, isotopic, faunal, and palaeomagnetic data indicate that Avalonia records a Neoproterozoic tectonomagmatic history that predates opening of the Iapetus Ocean and is considered to have formed as a Neoproterozoic arc-related terrane along an active margin of Gondwana (O’Brien et al1996; Murphy et al
Sometime between the latest Neoproterozoic and Early Silurian Avalonia rifted and separated from Gondwana as a microcontinent where it constituted the boundary between the expanding Rheic Ocean to the south and the contracting Iapetus Ocean to the north (van Staal et al1998; Murphy et al
palaeotectonic evolution of the major Neoproterozoic–early Palaeozoic continents.Despite its low abundance in sediments and sedimentary rocks, zircon is a common detrital constituent in many sedimentary rocks because it occurs in a wide spectrum of igneous rock types and is one of the few primary igneous minerals that can survive the highest grades of metamorphism and partial melting, as well as erosion, transportation, deposition and diagenesis, and thus can survive in the crust almost indefinitely (Mezger & Kro¨gstad 1997).
This study is the first zircon provenance analysis of Neoproterozoic–early Palaeozoic rocks from the type area of Avalonia in NewfoundlandWe herein demonstrate the ability of U–Pb detrital zircon geochronology to address two critical problems in Avalonia: (1) the timing of rifting of Avalonia from Gondwana; (2) the provenance and ultimate source craton in Gondwana of Avalonian sedimentary sequences.
2) comprises Neoproterozoic (c760–540 Ma), largely juvenile, low-grade arc-related volcano-sedimentary sequences and associated plutonic rocks that experienced a prolonged tectonic history before deposition of a terminal Neoproterozoic–early Palaeozoic cover of fine-grained platformal sedimentary rocks that contain Acado-Baltic faunas (Landing 1996; O’Brien et al
760–540 Ma), largely juvenile, low-grade arc-related volcano-sedimentary sequences and associated plutonic rocks that experienced a prolonged tectonic history before deposition of a terminal Neoproterozoic–early Palaeozoic cover of fine-grained platformal sedimentary rocks that contain Acado-Baltic faunas (Landing 1996; O’Brien et al1996)
The general evolution of Avalonia indicates a protracted and episodic geological history of tectonomagmatic and depositional events that define a four-phase succession comprising: (1) early phases of arc- and rift-related magmatism between 760 and 670 Ma; (2) a main phase (635–570 Ma) of arc volcanism with coeval sedimentary succession dominated by volcanogenic turbidites and cogenetic plutons; (3) rift-related intracontinental volcanism and interlayered clastic sedimentation that records the transition from an arc to a platform without collision between 570 and 545 Ma; (4) deposition of a Cambrian–Ordovician shale-rich platformal sedimentary succession (Nance et al2002).
2001) comprises a subaerial felsic to mafic volcanic sequence that is intruded by 630– 640 Ma plutonic rocks and unconformably overlain by Neoproterozoic marine siliciclastic rocks of the Conception GroupThe Hawk Hills tuff has traditionally been included with the younger Harbour Main Group; however, a U–Pb age from a felsic volcanic tuff sampled immediately below the sub-Conception Group unconformity yields a date of 729  7 Ma (Israel 1998), thereby negating any correlation with the younger volcanic arc sequences
Prior to the deposition of younger Neoproterozoic rocks, the Tickle Point Formation was intruded by granite and Gabbro of the 673  3 Ma Furby’s Cove Intrusive Suite (O’Brien et al1996).
Basal interfingering of the Conception Group with the Harbour Main Group, coupled with the occurrence of the Ediacaran index fossil Charnia in the top of the Conception Group, implies a depositional span of c50 Ma
Although sedimentation, which continued until the terminal Neoproterozoic, was accompanied by deformation and metamorphism expressed as local thrust faulting, gentle folding and low-grade (prehnite–pumpellyite) regional metamorphism (Calon 2001), there is no evidence for major regional orogenesis and crustal shortening.The arc–platform transition rocks are overlain by an undeformed, siliciclastic-dominated late Neoproterozoic–early Palaeozoic platform sequence
The arc–platform transition rocks are overlain by an undeformed, siliciclastic-dominated late Neoproterozoic–early Palaeozoic platform sequenceIn the latest Neoproterozoic– Early Cambrian, deposition was dominated by quartz arenite transgressive successions (Chapel Island and Random formations), which pass conformably upward into Middle to Late Cambrian shale and limestone sequences (Adeyton and Harcourt groups) locally accompanied by eruption of alkalic mafic volcanic rocks (Greenough & Papezik 1986)
In the latest Neoproterozoic– Early Cambrian, deposition was dominated by quartz arenite transgressive successions (Chapel Island and Random formations), which pass conformably upward into Middle to Late Cambrian shale and limestone sequences (Adeyton and Harcourt groups) locally accompanied by eruption of alkalic mafic volcanic rocks (Greenough & Papezik 1986)The top of the Avalonian platform is represented by the Early Ordovician Bell Island and Wabana groups, which record tidal-dominated sedimentation of micaceous sandstone, siltstone, oolitic hematite and quartz arenite (Ranger et al
The top of the Avalonian platform is represented by the Early Ordovician Bell Island and Wabana groups, which record tidal-dominated sedimentation of micaceous sandstone, siltstone, oolitic hematite and quartz arenite (Ranger et al1984).
U–Pb ages were obtained from single detrital zircon grains from six samples of Neoproterozoic–early Palaeozoic rocks from eastern Newfoundland in an attempt to constrain the tectonic evolution of Avalonia (Fig3)
A late Neoproterozoic age of deposition is suggested for the sequence as all three formations contain the Ediacaran fauna Charnia masoni (Narbonne & Gehling 2003) and a minimum age of deposition is constrained by a date of 565  3 Ma from a volcanic tuff in the Mistaken Point Formation (GDunning, cited by Benus 1988).
The youngest rocks of the Flat Rock Cove Formation overlie Conception Group strata with angular unconformity and constrain the age of faulting and deposition of the Signal Hill Group to the latest Neoproterozoic (Anderson et al1975).
On the Bonavista Peninsula the Crown Hill Formation is conformably overlain by the earliest Cambrian Random FormationFluvial and alluvial facies developed within molasse-like rocks of the Cuckold and Crown Hill formations are characteristic of braided river deposits interpreted to have developed in response to major uplift of Avalonia related to the Avalonian orogeny (King 1990).
The age of the Random Formation is earliest CambrianOn the Burin Peninsula the Random Formation conformably overlies the Chapel Island Formation, which contains the Global Stratotype Section and Point for the Neoproterozoic–Cambrian boundary at Fortune Head (Brasier et al
On the Burin Peninsula the Random Formation conformably overlies the Chapel Island Formation, which contains the Global Stratotype Section and Point for the Neoproterozoic–Cambrian boundary at Fortune Head (Brasier et al1994); elsewhere in eastern Newfoundland, the Random Formation underlies all exposed fossiliferous Cambrian strata in Avalonia.

The Mall Bay Formation is characterized by Neoproterozoic zircons that show one major cluster between 686  22 Ma and 581  14 MaFour older Meso- and Palaeoproterozoic components are present as single analyses of 1239  25, 1435  24, 1651  22, and 1823  36 Ma
The detrital zircon age distribution of the Briscal Formation of the Conception Group is similar to that of the Mall Bay Formation and is dominated by a zircon population that constitutes .90 percent of analyses and comprises Ediacaran zircons that range in age from 562 to 641 MaHowever, in the Briscal Formation this main group is separated by a Gap of 100 Ma from an older (c

Although making up less than 2 percent of the total, two analyses indicate the presence of Mesoproterozoic (1349  27 Ma) and Palaeoproterozoic (2160  24 Ma) components.Detrital zircons analysis of the Random Formation yielded ages from 64 zircons, of which 85 percent cluster in the range from 580 to 655 Ma

The new detrital zircon data from Neoproterozoic–early Palaeozoic rocks of Avalonia in Newfoundland demonstrate the temporal controls on zircon heterogeneity in the various sampled stratigraphic successionsThe data allow for the deduction of the changing tectonic regimes as the varied provenance can be correlated with discrete sources including contemporaneously generated Avalonian crust and older Gondwanan cratonic crustal sources.
570–620 Ma range, which corresponds to the period of main phase of magmatic activity in the adjacent Neoproterozoic Avalonian arcThe Conception Group is therefore interpreted to contain a significant detrital component generated by erosion of coeval igneous rocks formed in these arc sequences, which include the Harbour Main and Marystown groups
A minor cluster of older Neoproterozoic zircons between 660–680 Ma and c730 Ma can be attributed to erosion of the underlying early arc sequences (Furby’s Cove intrusive suite, Tickle Point Formation, and Hawke Hill tuff) of Avalonia
The overall coarsening- and thickening-upwards sequences of the Cuckold and Crown Hill formations (King 1990) indicate that deposition occurred in tectonically active fault-bounded basins controlled by major uplift of the underlying arc sequences during the latest Neoproterozoic Avalonian orogeny (Hughes 1970).The detrital zircon populations in the Random Formation are markedly similar to those in the underlying Crown Hill Formation (600–650 Ma) as both contain Palaeoproterozoic zircons
Early Cambrian transgressive quartz-rich sandstone sequences are present throughout Avalonia in Massachusetts, Maritime Canada, Wales and England (Landing 1996) and were deposited on shallow, wide, shelf platforms during eustatic sea-level rise (Sloss 1963).Similar to the Random Formation, quartzarenites of the Redmans Formation contain a dominant late Neoproterozoic population (c
Similar to the Random Formation, quartzarenites of the Redmans Formation contain a dominant late Neoproterozoic population (c620 Ma) and suggest direct derivation from the main arc plutonic suites
The presence of Mesoproterozoic zircons, mainly in the Redmans Formation (but an accessory component in other units) is consistent with the existence of a Mesoproterozoic (c1.0– 1.6 Ga) crustal component in the basement of Avalonia.
Zircons from sedimentary units in Avalonia show a wide age spectrum with well-defined Palaeoproterozoic, Mesoproterozoic and late Neoproterozoic (Ediacaran) agesAge patterns of detrital zircon data from main arc and transition samples in Avalonia are dominated by a unimodal population of Neoproterozoic zircons that almost certainly were locally derived from the underlying or adjacent arc sequences of Avalonia and deposited as first-cycle sediments
Age patterns of detrital zircon data from main arc and transition samples in Avalonia are dominated by a unimodal population of Neoproterozoic zircons that almost certainly were locally derived from the underlying or adjacent arc sequences of Avalonia and deposited as first-cycle sedimentsIn contrast, the sequences from the platform contain significant quantities of Mesoproterozoic (1.0–1.6 Ga) and Palaeoproterozoic (1.6–2.3 Ga) components
In contrast, the sequences from the platform contain significant quantities of Mesoproterozoic (1.0–1.6 Ga) and Palaeoproterozoic (1.6–2.3 Ga) componentsAlthough some of these zircons could have been derived from the underlying sequences as second-generation recycled zircons, the large population of zircons and absence of isotopic and geological data for an older basement component in the underlying units, however, suggest that the Meso- and Palaeoproterozoic zircons in the platform sequences were probably derived as first-cycle detritus from basement or from a crustal source that was external to Avalonia.
The Ediacaran zircons provide no palaeogeographical information as they overlap the known age range of underlying Avalonian igneous rocksThe older U–Pb detrital zircon ages, however, can be compared with potential source cratons that are characterized by Archaean to early Neoproterozoic tectonothermal activity
The older U–Pb detrital zircon ages, however, can be compared with potential source cratons that are characterized by Archaean to early Neoproterozoic tectonothermal activityThe detrital zircon population data presented herein to some extent match the age of tectonothermal events in Laurentia, Baltica and Gondwana; hence these cratons are potential sources for the zircons in the rocks of Avalonia.
Although Laurentia and Baltica have comparable geological histories during the Proterozoic, which suggest evolution as a single cratonic nucleus following the amalgamation of Archaean cratons between 1.8 and 1.9 Ga (Hoffman 1988; Gower et al1990), geological, lithological, faunal, palaeomagnetic and isotopic evidence indicates that Avalonia is a distinct terrane exotic to Laurentia (Williams 1964; Murphy & Nance 1989; Hibbard et al
The detrital zircon data also refute an eastern Laurentian–Baltica source because the analysed rocks in Avalonia contain zircons with ages of 2.0–2.4 Ga and 620–750 Ma, which correspond to major Palaeoproterozoic (2.0–2.4 Ga) and Neoproterozoic tectonic and crust-forming events that are noticeably absent from the geological record of eastern Laurentian and Baltica (Gower et al1990; Wardle et al
The Proterozoic detrital zircons match the age signatures of rocks found along the Neoproterozoic–early Palaeozoic West African and Amazonian margins of GondwanaThe presence of Meosproterozoic–early Neoproterozoic grains in Avalonia is, however, incompatible with a West African source, as the latter contains only minor occurrences of Mesoproterozoic (c
The presence of Meosproterozoic–early Neoproterozoic grains in Avalonia is, however, incompatible with a West African source, as the latter contains only minor occurrences of Mesoproterozoic (c1000 Ma) magmatism (de Wit et al
Mesoproterozoic and Palaeoproterozoic rocks are present along the Amazonian margin of Gondwana (Fig8) and correlate with the Sunsa´s–Aguape´ı (0.9–1.2 Ga), Rondoˆnia–San Ignacio (1.2– 1.4 Ga), Rio Negro–Jurena (1.5–1.75 Ga), and Trans-Amazonian (1.9–2.2 Ga) orogenic belts located along the periphery of the Archaean Amazon craton (Sadowski & Bettencourt 1996; Bettencourt et al
Current palaeotectonic models suggest that Avalonia formed along the Neoproterozoic margin of Gondwana and accreted to Ganderia (the leading edge of composite Laurentia) in the Late Silurian–Early Devonian during the Acadian orogeny (van Staal 2007)Opening of the Rheic Ocean separating Avalonia from Gondwana is therefore constrained to a period between the Neoproterozoic and Silurian
Opening of the Rheic Ocean separating Avalonia from Gondwana is therefore constrained to a period between the Neoproterozoic and SilurianHowever, there is considerable debate regarding the timing and extent of rifting of Avalonia within this interval
A Neoproterozoic age of separation was proposed by Landing (1996, 2005) based on contrasting Cambrian faunal assemblages and platform sequences between Newfoundland and Morocco, and interpretation of the Cambrian–Ordovician Gander Group as a slope and rise prism of the Avalonia microcontinentA Neoproterozoic separation of Avalo-
A Neoproterozoic separation of Avalo-nia from Gondwana is, however, inconsistent with a wide range of palaeomagnetic, faunal, isotopic and geological arguments (O’Brien et al
Avalonia is interpreted to have formed along the Amazonian margin of Gondwana and an Avalonia–Ganderia connection is unlikely because even though Ganderia and Avalonia have similar arc-dominated Neoproterozoic basement rocks, they have very distinct magmatic, depositional and tectonothermal histories (O’Brien et al1996; Hibbard et al
Separation during the Early Ordovician is supported by subsidence analysis (Prigmore et al1997), comparable faunal assemblages until the Tremadoc (Cocks et al
1997; Fortey & Cocks 2003) and palaeomagnetic data that indicate that Avalonia resided at high southerly latitude near Gondwana from the Middle Cambrian to the end of the Early Ordovician (van der Voo & Johnson 1985; Hodych & Buchan 1998; MacNiocaill, 2000; Hamilton & Murphy 2004)The zircon data presented herein are compatible with a younger timing of separation of Avalonia from Gondwana that occurred in the Early Ordovician (Fig
The zircon data presented herein are compatible with a younger timing of separation of Avalonia from Gondwana that occurred in the Early Ordovician (Fig9)
The absence of significant quantities of Mesoproterozoic and Palaeoproterozoic zircons in Ediacaran–Early Cambrian sequences of Avalonia suggest that zircons of these ages found in Ordovician rocks of the platform represent first-cycle detritus derived directly from Amazonia rather than second-generation recycled zircons from underlying sequencesThis interpretation requires that Avalonia lay adjacent to Gondwana throughout the Cambrian until deposition of the Redmans Formation in the Early Ordovician.
This interpretation requires that Avalonia lay adjacent to Gondwana throughout the Cambrian until deposition of the Redmans Formation in the Early Ordovician.Middle Cambrian to Middle Ordovician arc rift-related volcanic rocks in Newfoundland (Spread Eagle Gabbro), Wales (Rhobell volcanic complex), and England (Lake District arc) are generally considered to be related to Avalonia’s rifting and departure from Gondwana (Kokelaar 1988; van Staal et al
Middle Cambrian to Middle Ordovician arc rift-related volcanic rocks in Newfoundland (Spread Eagle Gabbro), Wales (Rhobell volcanic complex), and England (Lake District arc) are generally considered to be related to Avalonia’s rifting and departure from Gondwana (Kokelaar 1988; van Staal et al1998)
The Rheic Ocean may have opened in a manner analogous to the opening of the Iapetus Ocean, where protracted, multiple phases of Neoproterozoic rift-related magmatism were followed by later development of a Palaeozoic rift–drift transition (Williams & Hiscott 1987; Cawood et al2001; Waldron & van Staal 2001).
The Okinawa Trough is a back-arc basin in a prolonged early stage of rifting that formed in the Miocene by NW subduction of the Philippine sea plate causing extension of the Asian continental lithosphere behind the Ryukyu arc system (Shinjo et al1999).

However, the absence of significant volumes of Early Ordovician volcanic rocks in Avalonia suggests that rifting may have resulted from the propagation of an active, intraoceanic spreading ridge inboard to the edge of the Gondwanan margin in a manner analogous to the rifting of the Jan Mayen andAvalonia comprises a sequence of late Neoproterozoic volcanosedimentary sequences that are overlain by a Cambrian–Ordovician shale-rich platformal sedimentary succession
Avalonia comprises a sequence of late Neoproterozoic volcanosedimentary sequences that are overlain by a Cambrian–Ordovician shale-rich platformal sedimentary successionU–Pb ages of detrital zircons from Neoproterozoic rocks of the type area of Avalonia in eastern Newfoundland are dominated by Ediacaran populations with ages between 620 and 580 Ma that are interpreted to be derived from the underlying volcanic–plutonic rocks of the main Avalonian arc
U–Pb ages of detrital zircons from Neoproterozoic rocks of the type area of Avalonia in eastern Newfoundland are dominated by Ediacaran populations with ages between 620 and 580 Ma that are interpreted to be derived from the underlying volcanic–plutonic rocks of the main Avalonian arcThese rocks are inferred to have accumulated as a series of submarine fans in restricted faultbounded, arc-adjacent basins that grade upwards into terrestrial siliciclastic rocks deposited under subaerial fluviatile conditions without a significant change in provenance
Early Palaeozoic platform units show an overall up-section increase in Mesoproterozoic and Palaeoproterozoic zircons that are inconsistent with recycling from underlying Neoproterozoic rocksThe range of detrital zircon ages, combined with isotopic and sedimentological data, argues against Avalonia being proximal to West Africa and suggests that the former originated along the periphery of Amazonia
The rapid influx of Mesoproterozoic and older detritus in the upper sequences of the Avalonian platform suggests a major change in tectonic regime to expose older material that is temporally consistent with Avalonian basementWe conclude from the detrital zircon analysis that, if the rifting of Avalonia was marked by a change in provenance and the rapid influx of Palaeoproterozoic detritus in the upper sequences of the Avalonian platform, then separation of Avalonia from Gondwana and opening of the Rheic Ocean occurred during the Arenig
An Early Ordovician time of separation is also supported by stratigraphic, faunal, palaeomagnetic and tectonic data.There is close correspondence between lithology, depositional age and detrital zircon signatures of the Redmans Formation and Armorican Quartzite (Ranger et al
In this model Avalonia and Cadomia represent two different terranes with distinct basement rocks and contrasting Neoproterozoic histories (Samson & D’Lemos 1998; Samson et al2005; Murphy et al
The two terranes formed independent of one another on the Gondwanan margin but were juxtaposed along a Neoproterozoic suture prior to the Early Ordovician opening of the Rheic Ocean (Murphy et al2006; Linnemann et al
