All Silurian and older rocks of the Pearya terrane were folded during this event, and it was probably the fi rst time that the post–M’Clintock orogeny, Cape Discovery Formation and younger strata were folded (Trettin, 1998)A small porphyry intruded the northern Pearya terrane at 368 ±3 Ma (Trettin et al., 1992), which overlaps in age with both the youngest strata and detrital zircon within the Devonian clastic wedge (Anfi nson et al., 2012b).
