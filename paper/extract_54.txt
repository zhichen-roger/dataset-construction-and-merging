Concordant detrital zircon dates from Neoproterozoic to Paleozoic continental slope and trough deposits in northern Greenland indicate Late Archean and Paleoproterozoic sediment sourcesSignificant numbers of dates are, however, discordant and, together with a few apparently concordant dates, give ages younger than the depositional ages of overlying fossiliferous sediments

The discordance pattern implies partial or total radiogenic-Pb loss during the Middle Devonian, possibly facilitated by postdepositional fluid movementSuch timing of radiogenicPb loss is supported by results from a novel modeling method, which indicate that the greatest statistical similarity between concordant and discordant detrital populations occurs when Pb loss is constrained to the interval of 380–390 Ma, i.e., long after deposition
