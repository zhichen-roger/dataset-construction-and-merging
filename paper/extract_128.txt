While the evolution of this mountain belt is primarily driven by India-Asia convergence, several authors have suggested that its relief and erosion patterns have been strongly affected by the monsoon climate since the Miocene (e.g., Bookhagen and Burbank, 2006; Clift et al., 2008a, 2008b; Iaffaldano et al., 2011)Therefore, the Himalaya represents a unique natural laboratory where the interactions between tectonics, erosion, climate, and drainage evolution can be investigated

At the regional scale, the data are combined to discuss different scenarios of the evolution of the Yarlung-Brahmaputra drainage system since the mid-Miocene.Plate reconstructions and geologic data indicate that collision between the Indian and Asian continents began during the early Eocene (Yin and Harrison, 2000; Zhu et al., 2005; DupontNivet et al., 2010)

Plate reconstructions and geologic data indicate that collision between the Indian and Asian continents began during the early Eocene (Yin and Harrison, 2000; Zhu et al., 2005; DupontNivet et al., 2010)This collision caused signifi cant crustal shortening and thickening, resulting in the formation of the Tibetan Plateau and the Himalayan mountain belt (Hodges, 2000; Yin and Harrison, 2000)

From north to south, these are (1) the IndusYarlung suture zone, containing ophiolites of the Neotethys ocean and the Cretaceous–Tertiary Gangdese Batholith (also known as the Transhimalayan batholith) lying adjacent to the suture zone; (2) the Tethyan Himalaya Series, containing the Upper Proterozoic to Eocene sedimentary cover of the northern Indian margin; (3) the Higher (or Greater) Himalaya Series, composed of medium- to high-grade metamorphic crystalline rocks; (4) the Lesser Himalaya Series, mainly composed of low-grade Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks of the Indian plate as well as late Paleozoic–Mesozoic and Paleogene sedimentary rocks; and (5) the Sub-Himalaya, containing Neogene detrital sedimentary rocks of the Siwalik Group, derived from erosion of the orogen and incorporated into the propagating thrust wedge since the PlioceneThe Tethyan Himalaya Series domain is separated from the Higher Himalaya Series domain by the normal South Tibetan detachment system, whereas the other lithotectonic units are bounded by northdipping thrust fault systems branching off the Main Himalayan Thrust

Minimum Cenozoic shortening of 350 km was accommodated by these main thrusts and associated duplex systems in the eastern Himalaya (Yin et al., 2010; Long et al., 2011).The Yarlung-Brahmaputra River system, one of the major rivers of Asia, changes names twice along its 2900 km course from SW Tibet, across the eastern Himalayan syntaxis and into the Bay of Bengal (Fig

Others, however, have argued for long-term stability in the drainage patterns of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (e.g., Burg et al., 1998; Hallet and Molnar , 2001), and sediment provenance data from the Bengal Fan suggest that the Yarlung-Brahmaputra drainage system has remained stable and fl owed into the Bengal Fan since the mid-Miocene (Galy et al., 2010).Rapid erosion in the Namche Barwa massif currently provides between 46 percent and 60 percent of the sediment carried by the Siang River downstream of the Yarlung Gorge (Singh and FranceLanord, 2002; Stewart et al., 2008; Enkelmann et al., 2011)

The Neogene foreland basin deposits in Arunachal Pradesh are subdivided into the Dafl a, Subansiri, and Kimin Formations, based on sedimentary facies associations (Karunakaran and Rao, 1976; Kumar, 1997)These formations have been correlated with the lower, middle, and upper Siwalik Group, respectively, of the western and central parts of the Himalayan foreland basin (Yin, 2006)

To the south, the Siwalik Group is separated from the Quaternary deposits of the Brahmaputra fl oodplain by the Main Frontal thrust, while to the north, it is separated from the Lesser Himalaya Series by the Main Boundary thrust (e.g., Yin et al., 2010)Within the Kameng section, the Tipi thrust places the Dafl a Formation over the Kimin Formation (Fig

Finally,  there is no indication for eastward propagation of deformation and uplift in the eastern Himalaya during late Miocene– Pliocene times.A third scenario implies large-scale stability of the Yarlung-Siang-Brahmaputra drainage system since the late Miocene (Burg et al., 1998; Galy et al., 2010), with local changes only affecting its course in the eastern Himalayan foreland basin after 7 Ma (Fig

Therefore, these results do not support the hypothesis of a deceleration in thrusting and exhumation rates in the eastern Himalaya since the mid-Miocene, linked to potential transfer of shortening to the Shillong Plateau (Clark and Bilham, 2008)Surface uplift of the Shillong Plateau does not appear to strongly affect longterm exhumation rates in the eastern Himalaya, and, therefore, the proportion of tectonic shortening accommodated by this structure may be limited, as previously suggested by Biswas et al

Keeping in mind the loss of resolution when estimating very rapid exhumation rates from lag times (e.g., Garver et al., 1999; Rahl et al., 2007), the recorded late Miocene exhumation rates appear to be signifi cantly slower than the Quaternary rate of up to 10 km/m.yinferred from in situ thermochronology in the Namche Barwa massif by Burg et al
