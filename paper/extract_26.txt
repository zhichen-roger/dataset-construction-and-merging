Previous studies suggested that the GHS and THS can be distinguished from the LHS by Sr–Nd–Hf isotopic and detrital zircon geochronological differences, with the GHS and THS yielding less negative εNd values and containing abundant Neoproterozoic–Paleozoic (~1.0 Ga and ~0.5 Ga) detrital zircon, whereas the LHS yielding more negative εNd values and containing no detrital zircon younger than 1.6 Ga (Parrish and Hodges, 1996; Ahmad et al., 2000; DeCelles et al., 2000; Argles et al., 2003; Richards et al., 2005, 2006; Mottram et al., 2014)On the basis of these isotopic differences, the GHS was interpreted as an accreted terrane tectonically consolidated with the Greater India during early Paleozoic time (DeCelles et al., 2000; Gehrels et al., 2003) or as distal and proximal basins on the Indian margin (Myrow et al., 2003, 2010; McQuarrie et al., 2008, 2013; Yin et al., 2010a; Long et al., 2011; McKenzie et al., 2011; Webb et al., 2013; Mottram et al., 2014).

On the basis of these isotopic differences, the GHS was interpreted as an accreted terrane tectonically consolidated with the Greater India during early Paleozoic time (DeCelles et al., 2000; Gehrels et al., 2003) or as distal and proximal basins on the Indian margin (Myrow et al., 2003, 2010; McQuarrie et al., 2008, 2013; Yin et al., 2010a; Long et al., 2011; McKenzie et al., 2011; Webb et al., 2013; Mottram et al., 2014).In the Eastern Himalayan Syntaxis, detrital zircon age spectra of the quartzites from the Namche Barwa Complex are remarkably similar to those of the coeval rocks in the upper LHS in Arunachal (Yin et al., 2006) and cratonic successions (Alwar Group, Ganga Group, the upper Vindhyan Group, and Shillong Group) in northern India (Malone et al., 2008; McKenzie et al., 2011, 2013; Turner et al., 2014) (Fig

Therefore, we propose that the Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic orthogneisses in the Namche Barwa Complex represents the crystalline basement of the Indian craton, and the metasedimentary rocks represent the distal deposits along the continuous north Indian margin during Neoproterozoic–Cambrian.In this study, detrital zircons from the Namche Barwa Complex and Nyingchi Complex show similar age spectra, with major age populations of 1.00–1.20 Ga, 1.30–1.45 Ga, 1.50–1.65 Ga and 1.70–1.85 Ga (Fig

The Mesoproterozoic (1.3–1.5 Ga) rift could be related to separation of India from east Antarctica corresponding to the breakup of Columbia supercontinent (Upadhyay, 2008, and references therein)Therefore, the 1.30–1.45 Ga detrital zircons most likely were derived from the southeastern India and South Lhasa terrane itself

In addition, the Rayner, Rauer, and Maud Provinces of Eastern Antarctica contain abundant Mesoproterozoic basement rocks (Myrow et al., 2010, and references therein), and thus could also be possible sources for the 1.00–1.20 Ga grains in our samplesTherefore, we considered that the 1.00–1.20 Ga grains were most likely derived from the Late Mesoproterozoic orogens (e.g., ADMB, CITZ and EGO) in southern Indian Shield, South Lhasa terrane, and probably Eastern Antarctica (Fig

The 618–604 Ma metamorphism and ~500 Ma magmatism correspond to the protracted Prydz orogenesis between the eastern India, northwest Australia, and northeast of East Antarctica during Late Neoproterozoic–Cambrian (600–500 Ma) (Fig10) (Dong et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013b; Yin et al., 2010a; this study)

They considered that the ~1170 Ma detrital zircons were derived from the AFO in southwest Australia, and thus suggested that the Lhasa terrane was located adjacent to the Northwest Australia during the Late Precambrian–Early PaleozoicAccording to this paleogeographic scenario (Zhu et al., 2011a), the Carboniferous–Permian sedimentary rocks in Lhasa terrane should contain abundant Archean zircon grains because the river systems draining from AFO would pass through the Archean Yilgarn craton
