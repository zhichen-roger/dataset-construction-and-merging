Abstract: Detrital zircons from pre-orogenic Upper Ordovician to Devonian low-grade metasedimentary rocks have been dated by laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA–ICP-MS) to: (1) constrain the variations of zircon age populations within the autochthonous sequences of NW Iberia; (2) compare U–Pb detrital zircon ages with previous data; (3) test the hypothesis of the Armorica microplate as a peri-Gondwanan terrane separated from GondwanaThe similarity in the ages of detrital zircons found in the Palaeozoic samples studied here to those published for the Upper Proterozoic, Lower Cambrian and Lower Ordovician sediments of NW Iberia argues against the separation of Armorica, and points to a common source area for all of the Palaeozoic detrital formations of NW Iberia, the West African craton and the surrounding Pan-African belts

The existence of Armorica as a separate microplate was proposed by Van der Voo (1982, 1988) to account for the similar apparent polar wander paths for the Armorican Massif and Gondwana until the Cambrian, but a difference in latitude of 30–408 during the Devonian (Van der Voo 1979, 1982, 1988; Perroud et al1984)

The marked scarcity of recycled Cambro-Ordovician zircons (representing granitoids and coeval volcanic rocks) and, in particular, the absence of 490–460 Ma ages that could represent the erosion of the Ollo de Sapo volcanic rocks argues against the reworking of older depositsThe fact that these rocks were not supplying detritus to the sedimentary basin is consistent with the geological observation that they always appear covered by the younger deposits, with little or no discontinuity until the Devonian.
