The Ferron Sandstone Member of the Mancos Shale in the western Henry Mountains of south-central Utah records repeated progradation of flood-dominated deltas (so-called ‘‘Notom Delta’’ of previous workers)into a shallow sea of the Cretaceous Western Interior Basin of North AmericaFacies analysis indicates a suite of delta-top, delta-front, prodelta, and marine shelf deposits, which are arranged in crudely coarsening-upward cycles in the lower half of the Ferron Sandstone

Indeed, the Holocene and modern Burdekin River Delta is considered an excellent planform, process, and facies analog for the Ferron Notom deltasDeltaic complexes that are asymmetric in planform need not be constructed primarily from deflection of beach ridges, but as in the case of the Notom Ferron Sandstone, and modern Po and Burdekin Deltas, may reflect directional growth of delta lobes

Rather, a single model which incorporates a degree of natural heterogeneity such as is exemplified by the Holocene Burdekin River Delta may be a more parsimonious explanation for such intervals.The stratigraphy of the Ferron Sandstone in the depositional strike orientation (north–south) shows a series of laterally extensive delta front sandstone bodies the boundaries of which are concordant with the top of the unit and with a series of bentonite beds in the underlying Tununk Shale
