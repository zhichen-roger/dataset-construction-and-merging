Age and nature of the late Early Cretaceous Zhaga Formation, northern Tibet: constraints on when the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean closedCollege of Earth Sciences, Jilin University, Changchun, PR China
The rhyolite yields a concordia age of 118 Ma, and the greywacke yields nine age peaks of 247, 330, 459, 541, 611, 941, 1590, 1871, and 2482 Ma, indicating that the Zhaga Formation formed during the late Early Cretaceous and the provenance of its detritus was the Qiangtang areaThese data, combined with the Early Cretaceous ocean islands, indicates that the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean must have been open during the late Early Cretaceous
These data, combined with the Early Cretaceous ocean islands, indicates that the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean must have been open during the late Early CretaceousWe conclude that the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean closed after the late Early Cretaceous and not during the Late Jurassic or the early Early Cretaceous as proposed by previous workers.
We conclude that the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean closed after the late Early Cretaceous and not during the Late Jurassic or the early Early Cretaceous as proposed by previous workers.Keywords: Bangong–Nujiang suture zone; timing of ocean closure; Early Cretaceous; Zhaga Formation; Mugagangri Group

The Duolong Cu–Au porphyry copper deposit, which formed during the Early Cretaceous, has estimated resources of 7 Mt fine copper and 120 t fine gold (Li et al2011b, 2013)
Some scholars consider that the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean closed between the Late Jurassic and the early Early Cretaceous (Wang et al2002; Chen et al
Other scholars argue that the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean was still subducting during the Early Cretaceous (Li et al2013; Fan et al
The presence of unconformities between the Middle Jurassic Dejiguo Group, the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Shamuluo Group, the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Dongqiao Group, and ophiolites led previous researchers to suggest that the Bangong–Nujiang NeoTethys Ocean closed between the Late Jurassic and the early Early Cretaceous (Wang et al2002; Chen et al
However, more recent research reports the discovery of remnants of Early Cretaceous ocean islands in this area, implying that the ocean closed after the early Early Cretaceous (Zhu et al2006; Fan et al
We obtained a concordia age of 118 Ma from rhyolite interlayers within the unit, indicating that the Zhaga Formation formed during the late Early CretaceousThe Early Cretaceous is a critical period in the controversy regarding the closure of the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean, and the analysis of the depositional environment and provenance of the Zhaga Formation presented in this article provides an important framework for reconstructing the tectonic evolution of the ancient ocean
The Early Cretaceous is a critical period in the controversy regarding the closure of the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean, and the analysis of the depositional environment and provenance of the Zhaga Formation presented in this article provides an important framework for reconstructing the tectonic evolution of the ancient oceanFurthermore, the correlation of the Zhaga Formation with the Mugagangri Group, based upon similarities in rock assemblages and the characteristics of the flysch deposits, provides a framework for clarifying the tectonic evolution of the Mugagangri Group.
The Jurassic Mugagangri Group consists of bathyal to abyssal flysch deposits that formed within the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean and is dominated by greywacke and shale lithologies (Wang et al2002; Cao et al
The Middle Jurassic Sewa Formation consists of bathyal canyon deposits that formed in the Bangong– Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean and is dominated by channel conglomerates and greywackeThe Early Cretaceous Zhaga Formation is newly defined in this article and is dominated by greywacke and shale lithologies similar to those of the Mugagangri Group (Figure 2a).
The Early Cretaceous Zhaga Formation is newly defined in this article and is dominated by greywacke and shale lithologies similar to those of the Mugagangri Group (Figure 2a).The Dongco ophiolite is dominated by metamorphic peridotite, gabbro, and basalt
The ophiolite is an important remnant of the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean in this part of the suture zone and formed during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous (Qiu et al2004; Bao et al
The rhyolite of the Zhaga Formation yields a LA–ICP– MS zircon U–Pb weighted mean age of 118 Ma (Figure 4a and 4b), indicating that this formation was formed during the	late	Early	Cretaceous.	In	summary,	the	ZhagaFormation records late Early Cretaceous bathyal to abyssal turbidite deposition in the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean.
Formation records late Early Cretaceous bathyal to abyssal turbidite deposition in the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean.The Zhaga Formation was deposited in the Bangong– Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean, which was located between the Lhasa block and the Qiangtang area (consisting of the southern Qiangtang–Baoshan block, the LSLSZ, and the northern Qiangtang–Qamdo block; see Figure 1a)
The deposits were interpreted to record an Ordovician continental rift event (Jie et al2015)
The Ordovician continental rift event in the southern Qiangtang–Qamdo block, the expansion of the Longmuco– Shuanghu–Lancangjiang Ocean, and the Caledonian movement in the northern Qiangtang–Qamdo block could each have produced new zircons at ~459 Ma, and therefore, the 459 Ma peak age of detrital zircons from the Zhaga Formation indicates that the provenance region of the Zhaga Formation was the Qiangtang area.The Longmuco–Shuanghu–Lancangjiang Ocean began subducting at about 350 Ma and finally closed before 214 Ma (Li 1987; Li et al
The detrital zircons of the Early Cretaceous Zhaga Formation do not yield peak ages matching this period, indicating that the provenance region of the Zhaga Formation was not the Lhasa blockIn summary, the provenance of the Zhaga Formation was the Qiangtang area to the north.
Early to Middle Jurassic trace fossils, corals, bivalves, and gastropods are found in the western segment of the BNSZ, near Rutog County (Jiangxi Institute of Geological Survey 2005; Xie et al2009)
These fossils are predominantly Early to Middle Jurassic in age, with a small number of Late Jurassic examplesAlthough occurrences are rare, the fossils indicate a Jurassic age for the Mugagangri Group
Although occurrences are rare, the fossils indicate a Jurassic age for the Mugagangri GroupHowever, most of the deposits have no age constraints; although the Mugagangri Group is widely distributed, only a few sites contain fossils (Figure 7)
(2014b) collected coral fossils of Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age from the Mugagangri Group (Fan et al2014b)
The Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous coral fossils and the 118 Ma zircon U–Pb age indicates that some parts of the Mugagangri Group may be Early Cretaceous in ageThe timing of flysch deposition in the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean may therefore have extended from the Jurassic into the Early Cretaceous.
The timing of flysch deposition in the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean may therefore have extended from the Jurassic into the Early Cretaceous.The timing of closure of the Bangong–Nujiang NeoTethys Ocean is controversial
The occurrence of unconformities between the Middle Jurassic Dejiguo Group, the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Shamuluo Group, the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Dongqiao Group, and ophiolites led previous researchers to suggest that the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean closed between the Late Jurassic and the early Early Cretaceous (Wang et al2002; Chen et al
However, recent findings, including the discovery of the Early Cretaceous Tarenben (>100 km2) and Zhonggang (>400 km2) ocean islands, suggest that the ocean may have closed after the early Early Cretaceous (Zhu et al2006; Fan et al
If the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean had still existed during the Early Cretaceous, there should be sedimentary strata of this age recording deposition from the shallow-marine realm to the deep-sea basinIn the BNSZ, the Langshan Formation records shallow-marine deposition (Bureau of Geology and Mineral Exploration of Tibet Province 1993) but lacks evidence of deep-sea deposition
Evidence presented here shows that during the late Early Cretaceous, shallow-marine, bathyal, and deep-sea sedimentary environments coexisted in the Bangong– Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean, indicating that it was still a relatively complete ocean basin at this timeThe provenance of the Zhaga Formation was the Qiangtang area to the north, and the formation does not contain detritus from the Lhasa block to the south, indicating that the Bangong– Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean was sufficiently large to have completely separated the Qiangtang and Lhasa areas during the late Early Cretaceous (Figure 8)
The provenance of the Zhaga Formation was the Qiangtang area to the north, and the formation does not contain detritus from the Lhasa block to the south, indicating that the Bangong– Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean was sufficiently large to have completely separated the Qiangtang and Lhasa areas during the late Early Cretaceous (Figure 8)The Bangong– Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean must therefore have closed after the late Early Cretaceous, considerably later than the Late Jurassic and the early Early Cretaceous timings of closure proposed by previous scholars (Wang et al
The Bangong– Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean must therefore have closed after the late Early Cretaceous, considerably later than the Late Jurassic and the early Early Cretaceous timings of closure proposed by previous scholars (Wang et al2002; Chen et al
We propose that the unconformities between the Middle Jurassic Dejiguo Group, the Late Jurassic toEarly Cretaceous Shamuluo Group, the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Dongqiao Group, and the ophiolites are related to the closure of a back-arc basin of the Bangong– Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean
Early Cretaceous Shamuluo Group, the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous Dongqiao Group, and the ophiolites are related to the closure of a back-arc basin of the Bangong– Nujiang Neo-Tethys OceanIsland-arc volcanic rocks older than the unconformities occur in the areas where the unconformities are observed (Fan et al
The Zhaga Formation records bathyal to abyssal turbidite deposition in the Bangong–Nujiang NeoTethys Ocean during the late Early CretaceousSediment provenance was the Qiangtang area to the north.
The late Early Cretaceous Zhaga Formation was identified from the Mugagangri Group and contains similar rock assemblages to this groupThis indicates that some parts of the Mugagangri Group are Early Cretaceous in age and that the timing of flysch deposition in the Bangong–Nujiang NeoTethys Ocean may have continued from the
This indicates that some parts of the Mugagangri Group are Early Cretaceous in age and that the timing of flysch deposition in the Bangong–Nujiang NeoTethys Ocean may have continued from theDuring the late Early Cretaceous, shallow-marine, bathyal, and deep-sea depositional environments coexisted in the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean, suggesting that the ocean was a relatively complete ocean basin at this time
During the late Early Cretaceous, shallow-marine, bathyal, and deep-sea depositional environments coexisted in the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean, suggesting that the ocean was a relatively complete ocean basin at this timeProvenance studies indicate that the Qiangtang area to the north was the source of sediments deposited in the Zhaga Formation
The Zhaga Formation does not contain material derived from the Lhasa block to the south, indicating that the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean was sufficiently large to have completely separated the Qiangtang and Lhasa blocks during the early Late CretaceousTherefore, the timing of closure of the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean must have been later than the late Early Cretaceous and did not occur during the Late Jurassic to early Early Cretaceous as proposed by previous scholars.
Therefore, the timing of closure of the Bangong–Nujiang Neo-Tethys Ocean must have been later than the late Early Cretaceous and did not occur during the Late Jurassic to early Early Cretaceous as proposed by previous scholars.We thank Ms Xu Feng for drafting the figures and Prof Dong Yongsheng, Mr Yang Hantao, Mr Zhang Xiuzheng, Mr Hu Peiyuan, and Mr Wu Hao for their help in the field.
