The BNSZ is a relic of the Mesozoic Meso-Tethys Ocean(Sengör, 1979; Yin and Harrison 2000; Pan et al
Two models have been proposed to explain the subduction of the Bangong–Nujiang oceanic crust: northward subduction, as inferred mainly from the presence of a belt of Jurassic–Early Cretaceous arc–magmatic rocks in the South Qiangtang terrane (Allègre et al1984; Yin and Harrison 2000; Guynn et al
2015) and bidirectional subduction, as inferred from the presence of a Jurassic–Early Cretaceous arc–magmatic belt in the South Qiangtang terrane and arc–magmatic rocks mainly of Early Cretaceous age in the North Lhasa terrane (Zhu et al2009a, 2011b, 2013, 2016; Pan et al
Jurassic–Early Cretaceous strata are widely distributed in the BNSZ and in the area to the north of the zoneThese rocks contain important information about the evolution of the Bangong–Nujiang Ocean.
We use this information and zircon Hf isotope data to reconstruct the Mesozoic tectonic framework and evolution of the Bangong–Nujiang Ocean.The BNSZ separates the South Qiangtang terrane to the north from the North Lhasa terrane to the south
The suture zone contains ophiolitic rocks and Jurassic flysch that are unconformably overlain by the Early Cretaceous Shamuluo Formation (Pan et al2012; Wang et al
Mafic rocks in these ophiolitic rocks are of Jurassic–Early Cretaceous age and are of both mid-ocean ridge basalt and oceanic island basalt type (Wang et al2016)
The Jurassic flysch, which is called the Muggargangri Group, consists of deformed deep-sea turbidites containing dismembered ophiolitic fragments (Kapp et al2003, 2005b)
Cambrian metasedimentary rocks intruded by Ordovician granites are exposed in the south Qiangtang terrane, and are in tectonic contact with younger Carboniferous– Jurassic strata (Pullen et al2010)
Jurassic marine strata, mainly sandstone and limestone, are widespread in the South Qiangtang terrane (Zeng et al2006; Zhang et al
2012), and have been intruded by Jurassic andCretaceous intermediate–felsic rocks (Li et al
Cretaceous intermediate–felsic rocks (Li et al2014b)
The Lhasa terrane consists primarily of Precambrian crystalline basement, Palaeozoic to Mesozoic sedimentary strata, and Palaeozoic to Cenozoic magmatic rocksOn the basis of differences in the basement rock and sedimentary cover, the Lhasa Terrane can be divided into northern, central, and southern subterranes, separated by the Shiquan River–Nam Tso Mélange Zone and the Luobadui–Milashan Fault, respectively (Zhu et al
2011b) covered by Middle Triassic–Cretaceous sedimentary rocks with abundant Early Cretaceous volcanic rocks and associated granitoids (Pan et al2004; Zhu et al
The sedimentary cover in the northern Lhasa subterrane is mainly Jurassic–Cretaceous in age with minor Triassic components (Pan et al2004)
Voluminous Mesozoic volcanic rocks in this subterrane are exposed within the Lower Cretaceous volcaniclastic sequence that extends for ~1200 km from Rutong (80°E) to Nagqu (92°E)The Mesozoic plutonic rocks, which are mainly dated at the Early Cretaceous (ca
The Mesozoic plutonic rocks, which are mainly dated at the Early Cretaceous (ca130–110 Ma) (Zhu et al
2011b), are mainly confined to the western (such as Rutog and Yanhu) and eastern parts (such as Baingoin, Nagqu, and Sangba) of this subterrane and generally occur as large batholiths intruding the Jurassic–Lower Cretaceous sedimentary sequences.This study focuses on Jurassic–Cretaceous sedimentary rocks within the BNSZ and the southern margin of the Qiangtang terrane
This study focuses on Jurassic–Cretaceous sedimentary rocks within the BNSZ and the southern margin of the Qiangtang terraneSamples were collected from Jurassic and Cretaceous strata in the western part of the BNSZ, Gerze County, central Tibet (Figure 1(c))
Samples were collected from Jurassic and Cretaceous strata in the western part of the BNSZ, Gerze County, central Tibet (Figure 1(c))Samples GZ-08, GZ-16, and GZ-18 are from the Jurassic Muggargangri Group and samples GZ-09, GZ-10, and GZ-12 are from the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous Shamuluo Formation, both of which are within the BNSZ
Samples GZ-08, GZ-16, and GZ-18 are from the Jurassic Muggargangri Group and samples GZ-09, GZ-10, and GZ-12 are from the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous Shamuluo Formation, both of which are within the BNSZSamples GZ-01 and GZ-04 were obtained from the Jurassic Sewa Formation in the north of the BNSZ
Samples GZ-01 and GZ-04 were obtained from the Jurassic Sewa Formation in the north of the BNSZAll samples were obtained from outcrops
The Shamuluo Formation consists of interstratified sandstone and siltstone with shale and fossil-rich limestone of Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age (Xia and Liu 1997; Pan et al2004; Zhang 2004; Wang et al
Lake to the east of Gerze county) suggests that the age of the Sewa Formation is Early–Middle Jurassic (Zeng et al2006), and thus equivalent in age to the
Mesozoic ages (249 ± 3 Ma, 249 ± 3 Ma, 235 ± 2 Ma, 225 ± 3 Ma, 225 ± 2 Ma, 177 ± 2 Ma, 160 ± 1 Ma, 154 ± 2 Ma) were obtained from eight zircons in these samples, and two of these zircons yielded usable εHf(t) values: a 177-Ma zircon that has a εHf(t) value of 13.26, and a 160-Ma zircon that has aFigure 4
Zircons from samples 09-GZ-09, 09-GZ-10, and 09-GZ-12 are similar to those from the Muggargangri Group except the occurrence of the Early Cretaceous age population, and also display rounded shapes and small sizes (<100 µm long) in CL imagesOscillatory zoning is visible in most zircons
In total, these U–Pb ages from the three samples include 16 Mesozoic values (249 ± 3 Ma, 244 ± 3 Ma, 241 ± 2 Ma, 238 ± 3 Ma, 225 ± 3 Ma, 222 ± 3 Ma, 217 ± 4 Ma,113 ± 2 Ma)
The εHf(t) values of nine zircons from these Mesozoic zircons are varied, from −18.95 to 6.95.The CL images reveal zircons with different sizes and shapes in samples 09-GZ-01 and 09-GZ-04
These two samples yield 74 Mesozoic ages ranging from Middle Triassic to Late Jurassic, mainly in Middle–Late Jurassic, from which we obtained 58 εHf(t) values that vary from −8.81 to 2.37, with most being weakly positive.The youngest age of detrital zircons can be used to constrain the maximum depositional age, especially if both magmatism in the source region and sedimentation in the appropriate depocenter were continuous (Dickinson and Gehrels 2009; Wu et al
Scarce fossils within the Muggargangri Group indicate an Early to Middle Jurassic age (Zeng et al2006; Cao et al
(2015b) have established the Early Cretaceous Zhaga Formation from the Muggargangri GroupBased on the similar rock assemblages and sedimentary structures, they infer that the Zhaga Formation is simply the Early Cretaceous representative of the Muggargangri Group and suggest the
Based on the similar rock assemblages and sedimentary structures, they infer that the Zhaga Formation is simply the Early Cretaceous representative of the Muggargangri Group and suggest theage of the Muggargangri Group is continuous from the Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (Fan et al
age of the Muggargangri Group is continuous from the Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (Fan et al2015a)
This Middle Jurassic age is consistent with the evidence from the fossil record, such as corals (Zeng et al2006; Cao et al
The arc magmatism in the south edge of the South Qiangtang terrane is extensive in the Late Jurassic (see following sections)If the age of the Muggargangri Group is continuous from the Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, there should be Late Jurassic zircons in the Muggargangri Group
If the age of the Muggargangri Group is continuous from the Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, there should be Late Jurassic zircons in the Muggargangri GroupTherefore, we suggest the maximum depositional age of the
Muggargangri Group is likely to be late Middle Jurassic (ca163 Ma).
Abundant fossils in the Shamuluo Formation indicate a Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age (Chen et al2004; Zeng et al
Moreover, the lack of 130–110 Ma zircons in the Shamuluo Formation also hints that the maximum depositional age of the Shamuluo Formation is Early Cretaceous (ca135 Ma), because the 130–110 Ma magmatism in both South Qiangtang terrane and North Lhasa terrane is extensive (Figure 1(b))
Previous studies that used palaeontological data (such as ammonites) concluded that the age of the Sewa Formation is Early to Middle Jurassic (Zeng et al2006; Wang et al
This early Late Jurassic age is slightly younger (approximately 8 Ma) than previous estimates based on palaeontology, possibly because of the large errors on the paleontological data; therefore, we conclude that the maximum depositional age of the Sewa Formation is Late Jurassic (ca156 Ma).
A small difference in the age populations between the Shamuluo Formation and the Muggargangri Group is the presence of Early Cretaceous (~135 Ma) ages in the Shamuluo Formation, which is absent from the Muggargangri GroupConsidering the palaeogeographic position of the Bangong–Nujiang Ocean, we compare the age spectra of these two formations with the age spectra of the Lhasa terrane (Leier et al
2011), Triassic strata in the South Qiangtang terrane (Gehrels et al2011), the South
Considering the position of the Sewa Formation, we infer that these Jurassic materials were derived from the Jurassic plutons and volcaniclastic remnants of the arc–magmatic belt in the South Qiangtang terrane(Zhang et al2012; Li et al
Considering the continuous subduction of oceanic crust during the Jurassic, the Shamuluo Formation may reflect a residual marine-basin setting.The Sewa Formation shows a coarsening-upward sequence
During the Middle Jurassic, sediments derived from the South Qiangtang terrane were deposited in a deep-sea basin and formed the Muggargangri GroupDuring the Late Jurassic, deposition of the Sewa Formation (to the north of the Muggargangri Group) on the continental shelf of the South Qiangtang terrane commenced
During the Late Jurassic, deposition of the Sewa Formation (to the north of the Muggargangri Group) on the continental shelf of the South Qiangtang terrane commencedMeanwhile, the continental margin arc developed quickly and formed a highland that acted
Due to cease of the arc build up caused by the cease of magmatism (140–130 Ma, as described in the following sections) and subsequent erosion of the continental arc in the Early Cretaceous, sediments derived from the South Qiangtang terrane unconformably covered the Muggargangri Group to form the Shamuluo Formation.Evolution of the Bangong–Nujiang Ocean during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous

Nujiang	Ocean	opened	before/in	Triassic,	ranging from Carboniferous to Triassic (Kapp et al2003; Ren and Xiao 2004; Pan et al
Closure of the Bangong–Nujiang Ocean was likely due to collision between the Lhasa and Qiangtang terranes during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, although some authors have proposed that the Bangong–Nujiang Ocean closed after the Early Cretaceous (Bao et al2007; Fan et al
Stratigraphic and structural evidence, and models of mantle dynamics indicate that the Lhasa Terrane had already collided with the Qiangtang Terrane during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (Allègre et al1984; Dewey et al
Evidence about the northward subduction seems to be abundant, which includes Jurassic–Early Cretaceous arc magmatic rocks in the South Qiangtang terrane (Zhang et al2012; Li et al
The southward subduction has been proposed based mainly on arc magmatic rocks mainly of Early Cretaceous age in the North Lhasa terrane (Zhu et al2009a, 2011b; Zhu et al
Based on the source of the Muggargangri Group and the Shamuluo Formation in the BNSZ, and the lack of the Jurassic arc magmatic rocks in the North Lhasa terrane, we proposed the Jurassic northward subduction of the Bangong–Nujiang Ocean although we cannot exclude a possible southward subduction.Detrital zircons younger than 200 Ma from all the studied rocks, mainly from the Sewa Formation, generally yield a 170–150 Ma age cluster (age peak at ca
Thus, the detrital zircons record information about Jurassic–Early Cretaceous arc magmatism in the South Qiangtang terrane.The consistency of the age distributions of detrital and magmatic zircons indicates that the main period of arc magmatism occurred at 170–150 Ma
Besides, the abundance of Jurassic arc-derived zircons in the Sewa Formation compared to the diverse populations present in the Muggargangri Group samples further implies the flare-up of arc magmatism in Late JurassicIn addition, although the arc magmatism was reported as early as Middle–Late Triassic (Chen 2015; Zeng et al
In addition, although the arc magmatism was reported as early as Middle–Late Triassic (Chen 2015; Zeng et al2015; Zhang et al
2015), both the Middle–Late Triassic detrital and igneous zircons are rare (Figure 10)Considering the relatively abundant Early Jurassic detrital and igneous zircons (Figure 10), we suggest that the earliest prevalent arc magmatism took place during the Early Jurassic (Figure 12), which is conformed by the age of the ophiolites in the BNSZ dated mainly in the Early– Middle Jurassic (Wang et al
Considering the relatively abundant Early Jurassic detrital and igneous zircons (Figure 10), we suggest that the earliest prevalent arc magmatism took place during the Early Jurassic (Figure 12), which is conformed by the age of the ophiolites in the BNSZ dated mainly in the Early– Middle Jurassic (Wang et al2016).
The Early Cretaceous magmatic gap (140–130 Ma) in the South Qiangtang terrane (Li et al2014b) is illustrated in Figure 10(b)

(b) Age spectra of Jurassic–Early Cretaceous arc magmatic rocks in south edge of South Qiangtang terrane (Li et al2014; Hao et al
(c) Age spectra of Mesozoic magmatic rocks in Lhasa terrane(McDermid et al2002; Chu et al
U–Pb ages of Jurassic–Early Cretaceous detrital zircons and igneous zircons from the South Qiangtang terrane and Lhasa terraneData of the igneous zircons in the South Qiangtang terrane is from (Li et al
In addition, the mainly northern detrital source of the Shamuluo Formation possibly indicates that the topography of the Qiangtang terrane was higher than that of the Lhasa terrane, caused by northward subduction of the Bangong–Nujiang oceanic crust during the JurassicMoreover, this conclusion is supported by the transition in sedimentary facies in the Nima area from marine to non-marine at 125–118 Ma (Kapp et al
2007) and the development of an Early Cretaceous (ca125 Ma) peripheral foreland basin system in the North Lhasa terrane associated with the Lhasa–Qiangtang collision (Leeder et al
As for the late Early Cretaceous (120– 108) OIB-type basaltic rocks and interbedded limestones within the BNSZ, which have been interpreted to indicate the presence of ocean islands and are then the key evidence of the collision after the Early Cretaceous (Fan et al2014; Zhang et al
Although this study cannot completely exclude the possibility that the Bangong–Nujiang Ocean still opened during the Early Cretaceous, combined with the stratigraphic, structural, and magmatic evidence described above, we tend to think that the Lhasa– Qiangtang collision took place in the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, most likely 140–130 Ma.Consequently, if collision did take place at 140–130 Ma, the late Early Cretaceous (125–100 Ma) magmatic rocks on both sides of the BNSZ (Figure 1(b)) were possibly related to events that occurred after closure of the ocean (Xu et al
Consequently, if collision did take place at 140–130 Ma, the late Early Cretaceous (125–100 Ma) magmatic rocks on both sides of the BNSZ (Figure 1(b)) were possibly related to events that occurred after closure of the ocean (Xu et al1985; Harris et al
We suggest that the late Early Cretaceous magmatic rocks could be produced by slab break-off or lithospheric delamination during this period, which is supported by the presence of ca.110 Ma A-type granites identified in the middle segment of the BNSZ (Qu et al2012) and high crustal temperature indicated by the felsic magmatic rocks in the North Lhasa terrane (Harris et al
In addition, the εHf(t) values of the Late Mesozoic detrital zircons from all samples vary from –18.95 to 13.26 with the majority of them being weakly positive, which are similar to those of the Late Mesozoic arc magmatic rocks in the South Qiangtang terraneThus, U–Pb ages and Hf isotopic data of detrital zircons suggest that Jurassic–Early Cretaceous strata around the Bangong–Nujiang suture zone were derived from the north, which is conformed by the north-to-south palaeocurrent
Thus, U–Pb ages and Hf isotopic data of detrital zircons suggest that Jurassic–Early Cretaceous strata around the Bangong–Nujiang suture zone were derived from the north, which is conformed by the north-to-south palaeocurrentThis finding is consistent with the tectonic context of northward subduction of the Bangong–Nujiang oceanic crust during the Jurassic.
This finding is consistent with the tectonic context of northward subduction of the Bangong–Nujiang oceanic crust during the Jurassic.Ages of detrital zircons, combined with magmatic records, indicate that the earliest prevalent arc magmatism occurred at ca
The late Early Cretaceous magmatic rocks on both sides of the Bangong–Nujiang suture zone are probably related to slab break-off or lithospheric delamination after closure of the Bangong–Nujiang Ocean.We are grateful to B.-D
