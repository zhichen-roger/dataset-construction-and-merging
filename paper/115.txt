ABSTRACT: In the Fontainebleau Sand (Oligocene), superposed lenses of sandstone result from a silicification process controlled by the watertable during the recent geomorphologic evolution of the landscapeThe most outstanding feature of these silicified bodies is the contrast they show between the very hard, tightly cemented sandstone and the loose and permeable embedding sand
The Fontainebleau Sand is of Stampian (Oligocene) age and forms an unit 50 to 80 m thickIt overlies the Argiles Vertes and the Marnes a` Huitres and is overlain by the Calcaire d’Etampes and the Calcaire de Beauce (s.l.)
The strong correlation between the localization of the silicified sandstone and the current geomorphology suggests a relatively recent (Plio–Quaternary) silicification, near the outcrop zonesThe general arrangement of the sandstone in subhorizontal layers also suggests a control on their genesis by groundwater levels (Thiry et al
The simulation durations are relatively long but acceptable for the assumption of formation of silicified lenses associated with the downcutting of the valleys during the Plio–QuaternaryWater flow rate is the most critical parameter to fulfil mass balance and duration constraints, as has been shown previously by Canals and Meunier (1995).
