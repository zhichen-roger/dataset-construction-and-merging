In an effort to evaluate potential correlations with adjacent terranes, we conducted U-Pb and Hf isotope analyses on detrital zircons from quartz-rich metasedimentary rocks of the Banks Island assemblage and from Paleozoic strata of the southern Alexander terraneU-Pb data from the Banks Island assemblage provide maximum depositional ages ranging from Ordovician to Permian; complementary Hf data demonstrate proximity to a continental landmass during accumulation of most strata
U-Pb data from the Banks Island assemblage provide maximum depositional ages ranging from Ordovician to Permian; complementary Hf data demonstrate proximity to a continental landmass during accumulation of most strataThese ages and Hf isotope compositions are quite different from the more juvenile signatures of arc-type rocks that characterize the southern Alexander terrane, but they strongly resemble values previously reported from the northern Alexander terrane
At least some of this motion was accommodated along the Early Cretaceous Kitkatla shear zone, which now forms the inboard margin of the Banks Island assemblageDeformation and metamorphism of the Banks Island assemblage occurred prior to this sinistral motion, however, as crosscutting dikes yield U-Pb ages as old as ca
U-Pb and Hf data for Ordovician and older rocks of the Banks Island assemblage and the northern Alexander terrane are similar to values from the Timanides, whereas Silurian–Lower Devonian rocks yield values shared with Caledonian rocks in Baltica and northern GreenlandBanks Island assemblage strata of suspected late Paleozoic age are more juvenile, perhaps recording motion of the Alexander terrane from the circumArctic into the paleo-Pacifi c realm.

East of the Alexander terrane, rocks are assigned to the Yukon-Tanana terrane, which consists of Proterozoic–Lower Paleozoic quartz-rich metaclastic rocks overlain unconformably by Middle–Upper Paleozoic metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks (Gehrels et al., 1992; Gehrels, 2001)Quartz-rich layers in this terrane are similar lithologically to quartzites in the Banks Island assemblage
Nd-Sr signatures of these rocks also point to a continental affi nity for this terrane (Samson and Patchett, 1991), as do the abundant Paleoproterozoic detrital zircons that occur in all assemblages of the Yukon-Tanana terrane (Gehrels et al., 1991, 1992; Gehrels, 2001).Directly west of the Banks Island assemblage is the Wrangellia terrane, which consists of Middle- to Upper Paleozoic arc-type metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks overlain by Triassic–Jurassic volcanics (Wheeler et al., 1991)
Directly west of the Banks Island assemblage is the Wrangellia terrane, which consists of Middle- to Upper Paleozoic arc-type metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks overlain by Triassic–Jurassic volcanics (Wheeler et al., 1991)Like the Alexander terrane, these rocks have juvenile Nd-Sr signatures, characteristic of assemblages formed in a volcanic arc setting (Samson and Patchett, 1991)
The Alexander and Wrangellia terranes have been together since late Paleozoic time (Gardner et al., 1988), forming the Insular terrane of Monger et al(1982)
This composite terrane may have been accreted to the western margin of North America during mid-Cretaceous time, resulting in the widespread metamorphic and magmatic events of this age observed throughout coastal British Columbia and southeast Alaska (Monger et al., 1982; Crawford et al., 1987)McClelland and Gehrels (1990), McClelland et al
U-Pb analyses of igneous zircons from fi ve crosscutting dikes yield Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous ages (Table DR1)The ages (and 2σ uncertainties) for these dikes, from oldest to youngest, are 156.2 ± 2.5 Ma (11TC09), 149.6 ± 1.4 Ma (11TC03), 144.4 ± 2.8 Ma (11TC05), 121.5 ± 1.7 Ma (07GJ201), and 116.0 ± 2.3 Ma (11TC12)
Most Banks Island assemblage metasedimentary samples yield one dominant peak of Paleozoic age and scattered older grains (Fig4; Table DR1)
4 and 8) contain only Precambrian grains.Six samples (JN0202, 11TC10, 11TC19, 11TC14, 11TC15, and 11TC18; blue shading on Figs
8) and also contain signifi cant populations of Paleoproterozoic grains (Fig4).
The oldest interpreted group consists of two samples (JN0201 and 07GJ231) that lack Paleozoic grains and yield a nearly continuous distribution of ages between 1.8 and 1.0 Ga (black curves, Fig4)
Hf isotope compositions from these samples are mainly juvenile to somewhat evolved for Precambrian grains and moderately evolved (average εHf[T] of −0.3) for younger than 500 Ma grains (Fig8; Table 2).
These samples also contain a signifi cant fraction of Precambrian ages (purple curves, Fig4), particularly Paleoproterozoic, in contrast to the Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic grains in the 500–
4), particularly Paleoproterozoic, in contrast to the Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic grains in the 500–SE ALASKA, AND ALEXANDER TERRANE IN THE SAINT ELIAS MOUNTAINS
The one sample from this group that has been analyzed for Hf isotopes (sample 11TC07) yields a range of εHf(T) values for Precambrian grains and highly evolved values for early Paleozoic grains (Fig8)
Hf isotopic compositions for the dominant Paleozoic grains are moderately juvenile (Fig8), with an average εHf(T) value of +6.6 (Table 2).
U-Pb analyses have been conducted on sandstones of Ordovician (n = 2), Silurian (n = 1), Devonian (n = 4), Permian (n = 3), and Triassic (n = 1) ageMany of these samples were analyzed previously by isotope dilution–thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS; results reported by Gehrels et al., 1996), and several have also been analyzed by LA-ICP-MS (results reported by Grove et al., 2008)
As shown on Figure 9, all samples are dominated by peaks of Ordovician–Silurian age, which is not surprising given the abundance of plutonic and volcanic rocks of this age in the southern Alexander terrane (Gehrels and Saleeby, 1987)Ordovician strata yield age peaks of 558 Ma (Neoproterozoic) and 463 Ma, whereas Silurian, Devonian, and Permian strata yield nearly identical age peaks of 432–429 Ma
Ordovician strata yield age peaks of 558 Ma (Neoproterozoic) and 463 Ma, whereas Silurian, Devonian, and Permian strata yield nearly identical age peaks of 432–429 MaDevonian strata also have minor proportions of Precambrian grains that are commonly pinkish in color, rounded in morphology, and smaller in size
Devonian strata also have minor proportions of Precambrian grains that are commonly pinkish in color, rounded in morphology, and smaller in sizeThese grains were oversampled during grain selection and are shown with expanded vertical scale on Figure 9
Permian strata have additional age peaks of 366 and 288 Ma and a200      400      600      800     1000    1200    1400    1600    1800    2000    2200    2400    2600    2800    3000 Detrital Zircon Age (Ma)
Normalized age distribution diagrams of U-Pb ages from Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Permian, and Triassic strata from the Alexander terrane in southeastern AlaskaAbundance of older than 800 Ma grains (to right of zigzags) is exaggerated by a factor of 20 relative to younger than 800 Ma grains.
Hf isotope composition of detrital zircon grains from Ordovician through Triassic strata of the Alexander terrane in SE AlaskaAlso shown are Hf isotope data for nearby early Paleozoic plutons (Cecil et al., 2011)
Also shown are Hf isotope data for nearby early Paleozoic plutons (Cecil et al., 2011)Average uncertainty of all detrital analyses is 2.6 epsilon units (at 2σ)
Our one sample of Triassic strata yields only one age peak of 417 Ma, which is not surprising given that the conglomeratic sandstone rests unconformably on a trondhjemite pluton of similar age.Hf data for detrital zircons from these strata are shown on Figure 10
Unfortunately, few analyses could be conducted on Precambrian grains from the Devonian strata because of their small sizeThe Hf isotope compositions for younger than 600 Ma grains are mostly juvenile, which is consistent with the juvenile Hf signature of zircon grains from nearby plutons (Cecil et al., 2011; Fig
The average εHf(T) values for detrital grains are +11.1 for Ordovician strata and +10.7 for Devonian strata (Table 2).Comparison with Alexander Terrane in Saint Elias Mountains
(2013a) reported data from Cambrian– Ordovician strata of the Donjek assemblage, and Beranek et al(2013b) reported data from Silurian–Lower Devonian and Middle Devonian strata of the Icefi eld assemblage (Figs
(2013b) reported data from Silurian–Lower Devonian and Middle Devonian strata of the Icefi eld assemblage (Figs1 and 3).
Of particular signifi cance is the pronounced negative excursion of Hf isotope compositions displayed by zircons from strata of Silurian–Early Devonian age from the Saint Elias Mountains and from strata with 450–438 Ma peak ages in the Banks Island assemblage (Fig12)
As reported on Table 2: (1) Saint Elias Mountains strata of Cambrian–Ordovician age and Banks Island assemblage strata with 500–450 Ma peak ages yield peak ages of 477 and 478 Ma (respectively) and moderately juvenile average εHf(T) values of +5.8 and −0.3 (respectively); (2) Saint Elias Mountains strata of Silurian–Early Devonian age and Banks Island assemblage strata with peak ages of 450–438 Ma yield similar peak ages of 443 and 442 Ma and moderately evolved average εHf(T) values of −7.3 and −12.0 (respectively); and (3) Saint Elias Mountains strata of Middle Devonian age and Banks Island assemblage strata with 438–400 Ma peak ages yield similar peak ages of 420 and 434 Ma and average εHf(T) values of +4.9 and +6.6 (respectively).The remarkable similarity of these patterns lends strong support to previous interpretations
These patterns also suggest that Banks Island assemblage strata with 500–450 Ma peak ages are Cambrian–Ordovician, strata with 450– 438 Ma peak ages are Silurian–Lower Devonian, and strata with 438–400 Ma peak ages are Middle DevonianThe stratigraphic assignments shown for Banks Island assemblage strata on Figure 3 are based largely on these interpretations
It is interesting that a similar negative defl ection in εHf(T) values is not apparent in Lower Devonian strata from the Alexander terrane in SE Alaska (Fig12), where average εHf(T) values from Lower Devonian strata are all quite juvenile (Table 2)
12), where average εHf(T) values from Lower Devonian strata are all quite juvenile (Table 2)Instead, increased involvement of continental material during Early Devonian time is apparently recorded by the presence of small/round zircon grains of Precambrian age in the Lower Devonian strata
Instead, increased involvement of continental material during Early Devonian time is apparently recorded by the presence of small/round zircon grains of Precambrian age in the Lower Devonian strataThis may be a more distal expression of the same continental involvement given that Precambrian grains in Silurian–Lower Devonian strata of the Banks Island assemblage, Saint Elias Mountains, and southern Alexander terrane all have generally similar ages (Fig
This may be a more distal expression of the same continental involvement given that Precambrian grains in Silurian–Lower Devonian strata of the Banks Island assemblage, Saint Elias Mountains, and southern Alexander terrane all have generally similar ages (Fig13), but grains in the Banks Island assemblage and Saint Elias Mountains are larger and more abundant.
As shown on Figure 14, U-Pb ages from the two assemblages are quite different, with dissimilarities in both dominant Paleozoic age peaks (351 Ma for Yukon-Tanana terrane vs441 Ma for Banks Island assemblage) and in Precambrian age distributions
441 Ma for Banks Island assemblage) and in Precambrian age distributionsThese data do not support primary connections between the Banks Island assemblage and the YukonTanana terrane.
Normalized age distribution diagrams of U-Pb ages from strata of known or suspected Silurian–Early Devonian age from the Banks Island assemblage and the Alexander terrane of SE Alaska and the Saint Elias MountainsPeak ages are indicated for each distribution
Ages from the Yukon-Tanana terrane have been generated from metasedimentary rocks of Neoproterozoic(?) through Carboniferous(?) age in southeast Alaska and British Columbia (Gehrels et al., 1992; Gehrels and Kapp, 1998; Gehrels and Boghossian, 2000; Gehrels, 2000b, 2001).200    400     600     800   1000  1200  1400  1600  1800   2000   2200  2400  2600  2800  3000 Detrital Zircon Age (Ma)
An earlier phase of deformation and metamorphism has also been proposed in coastal British Columbia on the basis of geochemical data, which indicate that Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous plutons intruding the Banks Island assemblage were generated during a period of signifi cant crustal thickening (Girardi et al., 2012)The moderately negative εHf(T) values for the dikes (Fig
7) indicate that considerable crustal melting accompanied this Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous deformation.Given that fossils have not been recovered from Banks Island assemblage protoliths, and that stratigraphic relations are obscured by the deformation, metamorphism, and widespread intrusive bodies, our U-Pb geochronologic and Hf isotopic data provide critical constraints on the ages of deposition
For Banks Island assemblage rocks with peak ages between 500 and 400 Ma, the key to this correlation is the recognition of negative Hf isotopic excursions in Silurian–Lower Devonian strata of the Saint Elias Mountains and in Banks Island assemblage strata with 450–438 Ma peak ages (Fig12; Table 2)
This correlation is supported by similarities in the age distributions of detrital zircons from 450 to 438 Ma Banks Island assemblage strata and from Silurian–Lower Devonian strata of both the Saint Elias Mountains and southern SE Alaska (Fig13).
Banks Island assemblage strata with younger than 400 Ma peak ages are interpreted to be at least in part of Permian age (Fig3), on the basis of the similarity with U-Pb ages from Permian strata in central SE Alaska (Fig
3), on the basis of the similarity with U-Pb ages from Permian strata in central SE Alaska (Fig16), and the occurrence of one sample (11TC13) with a peak age of 306 Ma and individual ages as young as 256 Ma.
Normalized age distribution diagrams of U-Pb ages from Banks Island assemblage strata with younger than 400 Ma peak age and Permian strata from the Alexander terraneAges older than 650 Ma (to right of zigzags) are enhanced by factor of 20 for Alexander terrane and by factor of four for Banks Island assemblage
Younger Paleozoic strata of the Banks Island assemblage and Alexander terrane may record migration of the terrane out of the Arctic realm and into the Cordilleran realm (e.g., Colpron and Nelson, 2009, 2011).Metasedimentary rocks of the Banks Island assemblage yield detrital zircon ages ranging from ca
Similarities in Hf isotopic patterns for Cambrian–Ordovician through Middle Devonian strata in the Banks Island assemblage and the Saint Elias Mountains are striking and raise the possibility that the Banks Island assemblage was originally located adjacent to the northern portion of the Alexander terraneApproximately 1000 km of sinistral displacement is needed to bring the Banks Island assemblage adjacent to the southern portion of the terrane—some of this displacement may have occurred along the Kitkatla shear zone, which is known to have experienced sinistral displacement during Early Cretaceous time (Butler et al., 2006; Chardon et al., 1999).
Approximately 1000 km of sinistral displacement is needed to bring the Banks Island assemblage adjacent to the southern portion of the terrane—some of this displacement may have occurred along the Kitkatla shear zone, which is known to have experienced sinistral displacement during Early Cretaceous time (Butler et al., 2006; Chardon et al., 1999).The abundance of Precambrian detrital zircons and the highly evolved Hf isotope compositions of early Paleozoic zircons in the Banks Island assemblage and Saint Elias Mountains indicate that these regions were located near an ancient cratonal region during early Paleozoic time
The abundance of Precambrian detrital zircons and the highly evolved Hf isotope compositions of early Paleozoic zircons in the Banks Island assemblage and Saint Elias Mountains indicate that these regions were located near an ancient cratonal region during early Paleozoic timeBased on similarities in U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic data, as well as abundant paleomagnetic and faunal data (as recently summarized by Colpron and Nelson, 2009, 2011; Beranek et al., 2012, 2013a, 2013b), it is plausible that the Banks Island assemblage and northern Alexander terrane were located along the paleo-Arctic margin of Baltica, Greenland, or northeast Laurentia during Cambrian–Ordovician through Early Devonian time
Based on similarities in U-Pb ages and Hf isotopic data, as well as abundant paleomagnetic and faunal data (as recently summarized by Colpron and Nelson, 2009, 2011; Beranek et al., 2012, 2013a, 2013b), it is plausible that the Banks Island assemblage and northern Alexander terrane were located along the paleo-Arctic margin of Baltica, Greenland, or northeast Laurentia during Cambrian–Ordovician through Early Devonian timeThe northern portion of the Alexander terrane and the Banks Island assemblage were apparently also near a juvenile volcanic arc that extended suffi ciently far from the continental margin that some regions (e.g.,
Less geochronologic and isotopic information is available from the Banks Island assemblage and Alexander terrane following Early Devonian time, although Middle Devonian strata in the Saint Elias Mountains and strata with peak ages of 388–306 Ma in the Banks Island assemblage yield mainly juvenile Hf isotope compositions (Figs11 and 12)
We postulate that this tectonism may have been related to mid-Jurassic deformation recorded within the Alexander terrane (e.g., McClelland and Gehrels, 1990) and inferred to exist during generation of the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous plutons that intrude the Banks Island assemblage (Girardi et al., 2012).Finally, our sample “Absalom” records accumulation of plutonic-clast conglomerate during Early Cretaceous time
Finally, our sample “Absalom” records accumulation of plutonic-clast conglomerate during Early Cretaceous timeThese strata may have accumulated in part of the regionally extensive Gravina belt, or in a more restricted pull-apart basin along the sinistral Kitkatla shear zone.
