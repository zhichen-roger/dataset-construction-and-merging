Tracking Adria indentation beneath the Alps by detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology: Implications for the Oligocene–Miocene dynamics of the Adriatic microplateMarco G
The Adriatic microplate is a key player in the Western Mediterranean tectonic puzzle, but its Oligocene–Miocene dynamics are not yet fully understoodIn fact, even though the timing and magnitude of Adriatic slab rollback and backarc extension in the Apennines have long been established, the timing of progressive Adria indentation beneath the Central Alps and major strike-slip motion along the Insubric fault are still poorly constrained
Here we tackle these issues by utilizing detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology on Adriatic foredeep turbidites, i.e., by comparing the geochronologic fingerprints of the exhuming tectonic domes of the Central Alps (Ticino and Toce subdomes) with those of the Oligocene–Miocene turbidites chiefly derived from their erosionWe analyzed 11 sandstone samples ranging in age from 32 to 18 Ma
We propose that the rotation axis position was controlled by the interaction between the European and the Adriatic slabs, which may have collided at depth by the end of the Oligocene, triggering the westward shift of the Adriatic indenter beneath the Central Alps.The Adriatic microplate is a key piece in the complex Western Mediterranean tectonic puzzle (Fig
The motion of the Adriatic microplate relative to Europe during the Cenozoic is reasonably well constrained (e.g., Dewey et al., 1989), as are the timing and magnitude of Neogene slab rollback and trench retreat in the Apennines (Faccenna et al., 2001; Gattacceca et al., 2007)By contrast, no reliable time constraint is available in the Central Alps for the progressive westward migration of the Adriatic indenter beneath the Lepontine dome (Merle et al., 1989; Steck and Hunziker, 1994), and for the associated Oligocene–Miocene strike-slip motion along the Insubric fault (Schmid et al., 1989; Zwingmann and Mancktelow, 2004)
By contrast, no reliable time constraint is available in the Central Alps for the progressive westward migration of the Adriatic indenter beneath the Lepontine dome (Merle et al., 1989; Steck and Hunziker, 1994), and for the associated Oligocene–Miocene strike-slip motion along the Insubric fault (Schmid et al., 1989; Zwingmann and Mancktelow, 2004)Such a paucity of kinematic constraints along the northern boundary of the Adriatic microplate prevents reliable analysis of slab dynamics during trench retreat and backarc extension.

The Western Mediterranean orogenic belts record the progressive Mesozoic–Cenozoic convergence between Adria and Europe, and the consequent closure of the Tethyan Ocean between (Dewey et al., 1989; Jolivet et al., 2003; Handy et al., 2010; Malusà et al., 2015)In the AlpsApennines region, most of the Tethyan Ocean was subducted beneath the Adriatic microplate in Cretaceous time (Zanchetta et al., 2015), until Alpine subduction was choked by the arrival of thick European crust at the trench, followed by late Eocene exhumation of (ultra)high pressure [(U)HP] rocks and by the emplacement of Periadriatic magmatic rocks (Handy et al., 2010)
In the AlpsApennines region, most of the Tethyan Ocean was subducted beneath the Adriatic microplate in Cretaceous time (Zanchetta et al., 2015), until Alpine subduction was choked by the arrival of thick European crust at the trench, followed by late Eocene exhumation of (ultra)high pressure [(U)HP] rocks and by the emplacement of Periadriatic magmatic rocks (Handy et al., 2010)UHP exhumation was likely triggered by the northward motion of Adria relative to Europe (Malusà et al., 2015), which is still documented for the Neogene, when the Adriatic slab started retreating eastward (Faccenna et al., 2001), leading to the scissor-type opening of the Ligurian-Provençal basin and to the counterclockwise rotation of CorsicaSardinia, with a rotation pole located in the northern Ligurian Sea (Wortel and Spakman, 2000; Gattacceca et al., 2007)
UHP exhumation was likely triggered by the northward motion of Adria relative to Europe (Malusà et al., 2015), which is still documented for the Neogene, when the Adriatic slab started retreating eastward (Faccenna et al., 2001), leading to the scissor-type opening of the Ligurian-Provençal basin and to the counterclockwise rotation of CorsicaSardinia, with a rotation pole located in the northern Ligurian Sea (Wortel and Spakman, 2000; Gattacceca et al., 2007)Meanwhile, the progressive indentation of Adriatic lithosphere beneath the Central Alps led to the erosional unroofing of the Lepontine dome (Garzanti and Malusà, 2008)
The Lepontine dome includes two distinct subdomes of Cenozoic amphibolite facies metamorphic rocks (Ticino and Toce subdomes) that formed stepwise from east to west, at a distance of ~50 km from each other, as a response to progressive Adria indentation (Merle et al., 1989)The relative displacement between the Adriatic indenter and the overlying Cenozoic metamorphic rocks was accommodated by the right-lateral Insubric fault (Merle et al., 1989; Schmid et al., 1989), while the focused erosion of the Ticino and Toce subdomes provided huge amounts of detritus to the Adriatic foredeep turbidites, which are now accreted in the Northern Apennines (~80 percent of total foredeep detritus, according to petrographic and fission track data; Garzanti and Malusà, 2008)

The overlying Cretaceous wedge (Zanchetta et al., 2015) shows abundant Precambrian ages and an age peak at 32–30 Ma (r3 in Fig1), corresponding to the climax of Periadriatic magmatism.
Proximal samples include those from the Villa Olmo and Como Formations of the Gonfolite Group, fed by local sources encompassing the Bergell volcano-plutonic complex and the Cretaceous wedge country rocks (Malusà et al., 2011).After conventional heavy mineral separation, all grains were mounted (unpolished) on double-sided tape and depth profiled using laser ablation (LA) with a Photon Machine Analyte G2 ArF 193 nm excimer laser in a two-volume HelEx cell
2) show that the analyzed samples include, in variable proportions, grain ages belonging to the Periadriatic, Variscan, Caledonian, and Precambrian populations, as observed in modern sands shed from the potential source areas (Malusà et al., 2013).Periadriatic zircon grains define a stationary peak (Malusà et al., 2011) observed in all but one sample (s3)
The abundance of Periadriatic zircon grains largely exceeds 50 percent in proximal Aquitanian samples (s7 and s8), reaches 45 percent–50 percent in coeval distal samples also fed by Lepontine sources (s9 and s10), and decreases to 16 percent in the Burdigalian sample (s11).Among the non-Periadriatic zircon grains, the relative abundance of Precambrian grains is a good marker to discriminate more local sources feeding the proximal Adriatic foredeep (47 percent–65 percent Precambrian grains in samples s5–s8) from the broader sources feeding the distal Adriatic foredeep (14 percent–29 percent Precambrian grains in samples s1–s4 and s9–s11)
Among the non-Periadriatic zircon grains, the relative abundance of Precambrian grains is a good marker to discriminate more local sources feeding the proximal Adriatic foredeep (47 percent–65 percent Precambrian grains in samples s5–s8) from the broader sources feeding the distal Adriatic foredeep (14 percent–29 percent Precambrian grains in samples s1–s4 and s9–s11)The former sources are dominated by Cretaceous wedge country rocks, currently drained by the River Adda and particularly rich in Precambrian zircon grains, whereas the latter also include the metamorphic subdomes currently drained by Rivers Ticino and Toce, and containing a higher proportion of Phanerozoic (i.e., Variscan and Caledonian) zircon grains.

The Variscan-Caledonian zircon grain ratio is fairly constant in distal samples during the Oligocene (1.1–1.3), but sharply increases (to >5) at ca24–23 Ma (Fig
This indicates that detritus supplied from the Toce subdome became overwhelming at that time, i.e., since the AquitanianWhen considering that zircon fertility in bedrock is much lower in the Toce drainage (12 ppm) than in the Ticino and Adda drainages (68 and 36 ppm, respectively), this change in provenance is even more relevant because sediment contribution from the Toce subdome is prone to be underestimated in the detrital geochronology record (Malusà et al., 2016a)
24–23 Ma (Garzanti and Malusà, 2008), but not in the Paleogene and Cretaceous wedgesHowever, a major impact of the Paleogene wedge into the zircon geochronology record of the Adriatic foredeep can be excluded for the following reasons: (1) the zircon fertility in the Paleogene wedge is much lower than in the Lepontine dome (Malusà et al., 2016a); (2) the Paleogene wedge lacks of Periadriatic magmatic rocks, and cannot provide the Periadriatic signal observed in the Adriatic foredeep; and (3) large areas of the Paleogene wedge were not eroded, but covered by wedge-top sediments at ca

Most of the Cretaceous wedge also underwent negligible erosion during the Neogene, attested to by the widespread preservation of volcanic and subvolcanic rocks (Zanchetta et al., 2015).Detrital zircon U-Pb age data on foredeep turbidites indicate that the westward shift of the Adriatic indenter beneath the Central Alps took place at 24–23 Ma; therefore, it is broadly coeval with the onset of Apenninic trench retreat and backarc extension on top of the subducting Adriatic slab (e.g., Faccenna et al., 2001; Gattacceca et al., 2007)
These two slabs possibly collided at depth by the end of the Oligocene, hindering the northward propagation of the Adriatic indenter and triggering its westward shift beneath the Central Alps (Fig3A).
The interaction between the European and Adriatic slabs proposed herein explains not only the sudden westward shift of the Adriatic indenter, but also (1) the location of the Corsica-Sardinia rotation pole inferred on the basis of paleomagnetic data; (2) the location of the northern tip of the fan-shaped Ligurian-Provençal basin; and (3) the forelandward propagation of Alpine deformation in the Neogene, when convergence was no longer accommodated along the Alpine trench because of slab interaction at depth.Detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology on Adriatic foredeep turbidites constrains both the age of the westward shift of the Adriatic indenter beneath the Central Alps and the associated strike-slip motion along the Insubric fault to ca
