Environment and Diagenesis of an Upper Cretaceous Bioclastic Oyster Limestone Bed,Mohamed N
An Upper Cretaceous bi(Elastic oyster limestone bed, exposed at the Red Sea coastal strip, has been investigated for its depositional environment and the early diagenctic modifications affecting its componentsThe deposition of this stratum body marks the end of prevailed euxinic conditions and the setting up of an oxic milieu
Throughout the Phanerozoic, many groups of organisms evolved and ulilizcd substantially diffcrcnt biological proccsses to form carbonaLc buildups or reefs with distinctive mineralogies and compositionsThc Upper Cretaceous is a time where reefs and rccf mounds are abundmt in many places of thc world (JAMES, 1983)
Thc Upper Cretaceous is a time where reefs and rccf mounds are abundmt in many places of thc world (JAMES, 1983)Rudists and some other bivalves arc dominant buildups at that time (e.g
Thcsc fossil reefs offcr an exccllcnt opportunity for theoritical and economic studies but Lhcy includc some complication because of their variability among Lhc reef builders through time, their diagcncsis and in general their differencc from modem analogues (JAMES, 1983), The present papcr providcs an illustration for the depositional conditions of an example of Uppcr Cretaceous fossil reefs at Lhc Rcd Sca (Figl) with an emphasis on iLs early diagencsis.
The results are comparable to values obtained from other Upper Cretaceous bivalves from different areas of the world (e.gPIRRIE & MARSHALL, 1990)
Compositional changes of skeletal carbonates, in gencral, during the Phanerozoic are functions ofthrce variables; seawater carbonate saturation state, Mg/Ca ratio and temperdture (cfMACKEFUIE & AGEGIAN, 1989)
AL-AASEM & VEIÆR (1986) have argued that the Cretaceous sea was of comparable isotopic composition like that of the Holocene (i.e0 0/00 SMOW)
The depleted 8180 values displayed by many Cretaceous skeletal specimens from various localities are to a great extent close to our present data (c.fFORESTER et al., 1977; WHITTAKER et al., 1987 and MORRISON & BRAND, 1988)
This suggests that conditions causing depleted stable isotopic values were common during the CretaceousHowever, the documented manganese values (69 to 1285 ppm)which are relatively high although comparable to other Upper Cretaceous bivalves (cf
However, the documented manganese values (69 to 1285 ppm)which are relatively high although comparable to other Upper Cretaceous bivalves (cfPIRRIE & MARSHALL, 1990)coupled with the orange-colored luminescence of the analysed particles argue for some fresh water diagenetic alterations
However, Upper Cretaceous was a time of global sea level rise, high atmospheric C02 and high temperatures (MACKENZw, 1990)These conditions were corresponded, in general, to relatively low Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca in seawater & AGEGIAN, 1989)
The extension of the oyster reefs on the Upper Cretaceous platform at the Eastern Desert is limited, in general, by sea level changes, sedimen t supply and terrigenous influx and nutrient supplyThese factors must have controlled the northerly termination of these recfs.
The low Mg contents of these calcites can reflect the effect of temperature and a low Mg/Ca ratio of seawater during the global sea level rise of the Upper Cretaceous (cfMACKENZIE & AGEGIAN, 1989).
SWARTZ & 1960 and EL-TARABILY, 1966) SE Egypt and the Red Sca regions were areas of intensive volcanic activities during the Upper CretaceousThis provides perfect possibility for the thermal maturation of the organic-rich black shales (which are in places extremely rich in Corg)
