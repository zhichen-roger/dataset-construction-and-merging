Beginning in middle to Late Cretaceous time (ca106 Ma) the central Lhasa terrane was occupied by a regional foreland basin system that developed in response to the onset of thrust-sheet loading in the Gangdese retroarc thrust belt (Leier et al., 2007a; Kapp et al., 2004)

In any case, it is well documented that the Lhasa terrane had already collided with the Qiangtang terrane by this time (Girardeau et al., 1984; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Kapp et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2004), the rate of subduction of the Neotethyan oceanic plate beneath the Lhasa terrane must have been extremely rapid (Achache et al., 1984; Besse and Courtillot, 1988), and the Bangong suture zone was undergoing shortening and denudation throughout the Aptian–Albian (Kapp et al., 2005, 2007)We therefore favor the interpretation that during the Cretaceous, the Lhasa terrane was undergoing regional shortening rather than extension (Zhang et al., 2004) or transpression (Schneider et al., 2003)

Much of the Lhasa terrane was apparently uplifted and being eroded during this time period, producing the regional Late Cretaceous angular unconformity that marks the end of major regional shortening within the southern Lhasa terrane (Chen and Li, 1984; Coulon et al., 1986; Coward et al., 1988; Matte et al., 1996; Yin and Harrison, 2000; Kapp et al., 2003; Pan et al., 2004)In the southern Nima basin the onset of regional uplift and erosion was marked by the initiation of an ~50-m.y.-long hiatus (Fig

By early Tertiary time, the combination of crustal thickening during the Cretaceous and thermally driven isostatic rebound following lithospheric foundering (or slab rollback) could have produced regional high elevation in the Lhasa terrane (Murphy et al., 1997; Kapp et al., 2004, 2005)Toward the end of this episode, the Indo-Asian collision commenced, and Neotethyan oceanic lithosphere detached from the Indian plate and sank into the mantle, setting the stage for the insertion of Greater Indian lower crust and lithosphere beneath the Lhasa terrane during the remainder of Tertiary time (DeCelles et al., 2002).

Reconstruction of the kinematic history of the Himalaya suggests that Indian lower crust had underthrust as far north as the surface trace of the Bangong suture zone by about late Oligocene time (DeCelles et al., 2002)Although it is tempting to associate the middle Tertiary shortening events in the Nima basin with the northern edge of Greater India, we note that shortening was also occurring far to the south along the Indus-Yarlung suture zone (Gangdese and Kailas thrusts) during this time (Yin et al., 1994, 1999; Murphy and Yin, 2003)

In any case, the insertion of Greater Indian crust beneath the Lhasa terrane would have increased crustal thickness to its present value (70–80 km) by late Oligocene time, and raised surface elevations to their present ~4.7 km regional average (DeCelles et al., 2007).The Nima basin in the north-central Lhasa terrane of central Tibet evolved from a wide, generally southward-draining volcaniclastic, fl uvial piedmont basin to a locally partitioned set of sub-basins genetically linked to thrust faults related to reactivation of the Bangong suture zone in Late Cretaceous and middle Tertiary time
