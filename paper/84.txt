(In this paper, all explicit precisions are cited at the 2σ, or ~95 percent confi dence, level.) Some samples that are more fi negrained or contain components of Plio-Pleistocene age yield single-crystal dates of much poorer precisionOne solution to this problem is to analyze multigrain aliquots, rather than single grains
Analyses from several samples of the Triassic part of the Torlesse Supergroup of New Zealand (Adams and Kelley 1998) reveal a decidedly multimodal SPDFThe two groups of apparent ages comprise ranges from ~150–300 Ma and from ~400–500 Ma, suggesting two different source regions
Combined histogram and SPDF plot for 72 40Ar/39Ar muscovite dates from samples of the Triassic Torlesse Supergroup from New Zealand (Adams and Kelley 1998)The bin size for the histogram is 5 million years
Among the 40Ar/39Ar community, this approach was pioneered by Kelley and Bluck (1989; 1992) in their studies of detrital micas from the Ordovician Southern Uplands sequence of ScotlandSubsequent research demonstrated the applicability of the technique to understanding sedimentary transport in a variety of continental settings (e.g., Renne et al
(2000; 2002) reported impressive results for hornblendes and micas from ice-rafted detritus in Quaternary North Atlantic sediment cores that indicate derivation from the Labrador Sea region.Constraining minimum depositional ages of ancient sediments
Copeland and Harrison (1990) used 40Ar/39Ar data from Ocean Drilling Program sediment cores in the distal Bengal Fan to demonstrate that rocks metamorphosed during the Himalayan orogeny had been uplifted to the surface and were providing detritus to the fan by Middle Miocene timeMore detailed investigations of the timing of Himalayan rock uplift have involved dating detrital K-feldspar and micas from more proximal foreland deposits (Harrison et al
The curves are markedly different on either side of the transition: almost all grains from tributaries to the north give Miocene or younger apparent ages, while grains from tributaries to the south give Paleozoic or Proterozoic apparent agesThe detrital thermochronologic data suggest that the physiographic transition marks the position of a recently active, south-vergent thrust fault that accommodates uplift of the high Himalayan ranges relative to their foothills
Although exposures are poor along the transition in the Burhi Gandaki and Trisuli drainages, mapping to the west along strike demonstrates the existence of a system of Pliocene-Quaternary thrust faults with the necessary kinematics to explain the detrital thermochronologic data (Hodges et al2004).
