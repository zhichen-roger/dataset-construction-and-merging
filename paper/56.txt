New constraints on orogenic models of the southern Central Andean Plateau: Cenozoic basin evolution and bedrock exhumationRenjie Zhou1,, Lindsay M
In the Antofagasta de la Sierra region of NW Argentina, data from sedimentary geology, sandstone modal composition, detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology, and apatite fission-track and (U-Th-Sm)/He thermochronology indicate that sediments accumulated in the late Eocene to early Oligocene, with a maximum depositional age of ca39–38 Ma provided by the youngest detrital zircon U-Pb dates
Provenance data, including paleocurrent indicators, sandstone modal composition, and detrital zircon U-Pb ages, point to prevailing western sources, including the Sierra de Quebrada Honda (a proximal source), the Ordovician to Late Cambrian Famatinian magmatic arc in western Argentina and Chile (a distal source), and the Permian–Triassic plutonic and volcanic rocks in coastal Chile (a distal source)Along the western basin margin, these strata were deformed by a basement-involved thrust fault that was active at ca
Analysis of new and existing U-Pb geochronol ogic data from both detrital and basement samples across the Puna suggests that the Sierra Laguna Blanca, a major mountain range in the southern Puna, remained b uried during the late Eocene to early OligoceneOur multidisciplinary data indicate that the southern Central Andean Plateau may have hosted a regional basin primarily formed by lithospheric flexure during the late Eocene

Furthermore, this study refines the history of basin compartmentaliza tion and exhumation of the major mountain ranges in the southern Puna, revealing propagation of deformation from the west to east, starting as early as the late Eocene and continuing to the mid-late Miocene.Orogenic systems are inherently complex, and unravelling the many possible modes of deformation is challenging even when abundant geologic data are available
For example, various models have been proposed to explain the Cenozoic evolution of the Central Andean Plateau (Fig1), an important example of an orogenic system on a noncollisional plate boundary, including: distributed deformation along inherited crustal heterogeneities (e.g., Carrera et al., 2006; Grier et al., 1991; Hongn et al., 2007; Iaffa et al., 2013; Kley et al., 1999, 2005; Monaldi et al., 2008); range uplift modulated by deposition and erosion (e.g., Sobel and Strecker, 2003; Sobel et al., 2003; Hilley and Strecker, 2005); surface uplift, subsidence, contraction, or extension caused by lower lithosphere founder ing (e.g., DeCelles et al., 2015a; Garzione et al., 2008; Schoenbohm and Carrapa, 2015; Zhou and Schoenbohm, 2015); and formation of a foreland basin through lithospheric flexure (e.g., Jordan and Alonso, 1987; Horton, 2005; DeCelles et al., 2011)
The first class of models emphasizes the reactivation of pree xisting crustal heterogeneities, such as inherited deep­seated faults created during Cretaceous riftingIn the model, as the region underwent Cenozoic shortening, the availability of these weaknesses led to range uplift distributed across a broad region (e.g., Hongn et al., 2007; Sobel et al., 2003; Strecker et al., 2012)
In the model, as the region underwent Cenozoic shortening, the availability of these weaknesses led to range uplift distributed across a broad region (e.g., Hongn et al., 2007; Sobel et al., 2003; Strecker et al., 2012)This “ broken foreland” style of deformation has been documented in the Neogene Eastern Cordillera of NW Argentina, where former rift structures were reactivated, and deformation has occurred irregularly, rather than progressing sequentially across the region over time (e.g., del Papa et al., 2013; Hain et al., 2011; Hongn et al., 2007; Pingel et al., 2014; Sobel et al., 2003; Strecker et al., 2012)
This “ broken foreland” style of deformation has been documented in the Neogene Eastern Cordillera of NW Argentina, where former rift structures were reactivated, and deformation has occurred irregularly, rather than progressing sequentially across the region over time (e.g., del Papa et al., 2013; Hain et al., 2011; Hongn et al., 2007; Pingel et al., 2014; Sobel et al., 2003; Strecker et al., 2012)The alternative class of models argues that the Central Andean Plateau developed as an orogenic wedge, as evidenced by a parallel N­S–trending mountain front and a regional foreland basin that migrated east over time (e.g., Carrapa et al., 2011; DeCelles et al., 2011, 2015b; Horton, 2005)
This wedge style of deformation has been proposed in the northern Puna, where sedimentary records reveal a foreland basin in the Paleogene that subsequently propagated to the east, riding over the Eastern Cordillera as early as the Eocene (e.g., DeCelles et al., 2011).The southern Puna (~26°S–27°S; Fig
The southern Central Andean Plateau may have hosted a single regional basin during the late Eocene to early Oligocene, implying the existence of a regional flexural basin as early as the late Eocene (Zhou et al., 2016)Yet, the modern southern Central Andean Plateau is characterized by a series of high­relief, ~N­S–trending ranges situated among small­scale salars

Our data show that the region was dominated by a propagating orogenic strain front associated with a flexural basin starting as early as the late Eocene, consistent with the wedge class of modelsWe also find evidence for reactivation of relict landscape or structures on the cratonic side of the orogen starting at the same time
Basins were compartmentalized by broken foreland–style range uplift from the late Oligocene to the present, but deformation proceeded from west to east in the manner of a propagating wedgeThus, both modes of deformation may have influenced the region, with spatial and temporal overlap
Cenozoic volcanic activity varies spatially and temporally (e.g., Trumbull et al., 2006; Kay and Coira, 2009), which may reflect the changing angle of the subducting Nazca plate (e.g., Trumbull et al., 2006; Guzmán et al., 2014; Kay and Coira, 2009) and varying fluxes of magma during the proposed Cordilleran cycle (DeCelles et al., 2009; DeCelles et al., 2015b)An important volcanic hiatus ca
Volcanic activity resumed in the late Oligocene to early Miocene, reflected by mafic lava flows at the Segerstrom volcanic belt on the Chilean side of the southern Puna (e.g., Baker et al., 1987; González­Ferrán et al., 1985; Kay et al., 1994a).The present­day morphology of the southern Central Andean Plateau, the adjacent Eastern Cordillera, and the Sierra Pampeanas to the south is characterized by sedimentary basins Alonso et al., 1991; Carrapa et al., 2005; Jordan and Alonso, 1987; Kraemer et al., 1999; Vandervoort et al., 1995; Voss, 2002).
The Sierra de Calalaste is mostly composed of lowgrade metamorphosed Ordovician sedimentary and volcanic rocks (e.g., Martínez, 1995)Other rock types include metabasites, granitoids, and migmatitic gneisses, with the latter dated to ca
The Sierra Laguna Blanca is composed of orthogneiss and granitoids with an inferred Ordovician age (e.g., Lucassen et al., 2000), but no zircon geochronologic data were available before this study.Finally, we analyzed published detrital zircon U­Pb geochronologic data from the Pasto Ventura region adjacent to the Sierra Laguna Blanca, which hosts sedimentary strata as old as late Eocene (Zhou et al., 2016).
Finally, we analyzed published detrital zircon U­Pb geochronologic data from the Pasto Ventura region adjacent to the Sierra Laguna Blanca, which hosts sedimentary strata as old as late Eocene (Zhou et al., 2016).We mapped exposed sedimentary units in the field and remotely (Fig
Because of the lack of geochronologic data, previous studies assigned various ages to the Antofagasta strata, including mid­Miocene (Martínez, 1995), Tertiary (Schnurr et al., 2006), and a combination of Permian and Eocene ( Seggiaro et al., 2006)Three sedimentary sections were measured in the field, recording imbricated pebbles as paleocurrent indicators (Figs

ied sedimentary sections in the Antofagasta de la Sierra region are no younger than late Oligocene based on the lack of volcanic input, and they are time­equivalent with the Upper Eocene to Lower Oligocene Quiñoas Formation in the Salar de Antofalla region to the west (Fig1).

This is consistent with the material having been sourced in the Precambrian Antofalla terrane, which makes up the basement for most of the western­central Puna (Ramos, 2008, 2010)The Precambrian basement experienced multiphase metamorphism during late Proterozoic to early Ordovician time, resulting in the series of ages found in the zircon overgrowth (rims, Fig

9E and 9F), pointing to a source in the Permian–Triassic plutonic and volcanic rocks in coastal Chile on the western margin of the Puna (e.g., López­Gamundí and Breitkreuz, 1997; Breitkreuz and Zeil, 1994).Detrital samples also yielded a limited number of Cenozoic ages; we measured four grains
Detrital samples also yielded a limited number of Cenozoic ages; we measured four grainsFigure 8
In sample ADR6, two Cenozoic ages were 38.3 ± 0.5 Ma and 39.4 ± 0.6 Ma, enabling us to calculate a weighted mean age of 38.69 ±0.74 Ma
They are consistent with our Upper Eocene to Lower Oligocene age inference for the Antofagasta de la Sierra sections based on structural geology, sandstone modal composition, and detrital apatite thermochronology.We performed low­temperature thermochronology on two bedrock samples from the eastern edge of the Sierra de Calalaste in order to constrain the timing of exhumation, and therefore the timing of deformation, of the eastern range.
11B), the inverse model with AFT data provides constraints for its thermal history since the CretaceousThe model favors cooling from the initial input temperature (160–180 Ma) to ~60–70 °C, the upper part of the PAZ, by ca
20 Ma, with cooling to surface temperature allowed, but not required, in the early Cenozoic (ca60–50 Ma; Fig
11), in line with the timing of proposed late Eocene to early Oligocene (ca38–28 Ma) basin formation in the Antofagasta de la Sierra region.
Scattered ages as old as 2000 Ma indicate that rocks of the Sierra Laguna Blanca are a result of partial melting of Precambrian basement during the mid­late Cambrian to the earliest Ordovician, predating the Famatinian magmatic arc (ca495 Ma; e.g., Ducea et al., 2015).
Because bedrock in the Puna consists mostly of Precambrian terranes that experienced multiple phases of metamorphism during the Proterozoic and Paleozoic, detrital zircon U­Pb ages obtained in the Puna commonly yield similarlooking age plots with peaks at ca400–600 Ma
Second, the strata yield similar sandstone modal compositions to that of the Quiñoas Formation to the west and the lowest unit in the Pasto Ventura region to the east, both of which are argued to be late Eocene to early Oligocene (Fig5; Adelmann, 2001; Carrapa et al., 2005; K raemer et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 2016)
Our data demonstrate the existence of an Eocene–Oligocene regional basin connecting the Quiñoas Formation, Antofagasta de la Sierra strata, and Pasto Ventura strataFirst, thermochronologic data demonstrate the two mountain ranges that compartmentalize the region today, the Sierra de Calalaste and the Sierra Laguna Blanca, had not yet been exhumed, and therefore could not have formed barriers to an integrated regional basin in the Eocene–Oligocene
First, thermochronologic data demonstrate the two mountain ranges that compartmentalize the region today, the Sierra de Calalaste and the Sierra Laguna Blanca, had not yet been exhumed, and therefore could not have formed barriers to an integrated regional basin in the Eocene–OligoceneFurthermore, paleocurrent indicators in both the Quiñoas Formation and Antofagasta de la Sierra strata indicate eastward paleoflow
Therefore, the data support a regional­scale sedimentary basin in the southern Puna (~26°S–27°S) during the late Eocene to early Oligocene that covered the present­day Salar de Antofalla region, the Sierra de Calalaste, the Antofagasta de la Sierra region, the Sierra Laguna Blanca, and the Pasto Ventura region, extending at least ~150 km from west to east (Zhou et al., 2016)The maximum thickness of the Quiñoas Formation to the west is ~1.4 km, consisting of playa mudflat, alluvial fan and sheetflood, and distal braided river deposits (e.g., Adelmann, 2001; Carrapa et al., 2005)
To the east in the Pasto Ventura region, only an ~400 m section of the lowest unit is exposed, but it contains coarse cross­bedded red sandstone and siltstone, pedogenic carbonate nodules, and paleosol horizons, indicating slow accumulation and prolonged subaerial exposure in the late Eocene to early Oligocene, with pos­Figure 14

Therefore, this early southern Puna basin was asymmetric, with its depo center located in the Antofagasta de la Sierra region where the thickest (>3.4 km) Upper Eocene to Lower Oligocene units are found.After its formation in the late Eocene to early Oligocene, this basin in the southern Puna was compartmentalized by several major basementcored mountain ranges (Figs
After its formation in the late Eocene to early Oligocene, this basin in the southern Puna was compartmentalized by several major basementcored mountain ranges (Figs1 and 14), forming small­scale basins, some of which continued to accumulate sediment, while others experienced sediment starvation (e.g., Adelmann, 2001; Carrapa et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2016)
To the east, AFT and (U­Th­Sm)/He data reveal that the Sierra Laguna Blanca experienced its most recent exhumation in the middle­late Miocene (ca15–10 Ma; Zhou et al., 2014)
In refining the development history of the southern Puna, we find that (1) this region was occupied by a foreland basin, with a western depocenter, during the late Eocene to early Oligo cene; and (2) in the southern Puna, a wave of deformation initiated as early as late Eocene in the west and progressed to the east, as evidenced by documented cooling ages of major bedrock mountain ranges (Fig14).
We argue that, during the late Eocene to early Oligocene, lithospheric flexure was the dominant deformation mechanism in the southern Puna, based on the geometry of the basin (this study; Zhou et al., 2016)The proximal source region of this basin, the Sierra Quebrada Honda, marked the location of the orogenic strain front during the late Eocene to early Oligocene (Fig
The proximal source region of this basin, the Sierra Quebrada Honda, marked the location of the orogenic strain front during the late Eocene to early Oligocene (Fig14B)
First, studies in the northern Puna and the Altiplano place the orogenic strain front in the western plateau during the late Eocene (e.g., Carrapa et al., 2011; DeCelles and Horton, 2003; McQuarrie et al., 2005; Uba et al., 2006), requiring a map­view deflection of orogenic strain front from the northern to the southern Puna (Figs14A and 14C)
Second, the Sierra Chango Real, the proposed eastern boundary of the early basin (Zhou et al., 2016), yields late Eocene AFT ages (Coutand et al., 2001), suggesting exhumation during the formation of this basinThis location was active, yet it was ~180 km east of the proposed orogenic strain front.
We suggest that these two apparent conflicts may be resolved by invoking a role for inherited cratonic structures in modulating the propagation of the Cenozoic strain frontThe Cretaceous rift developed mostly in the northern Puna Plateau and its Eastern Cordi llera, covering both regions with thick Cretaceous rift deposits (Marquillas et al., 2005)
The Cretaceous rift developed mostly in the northern Puna Plateau and its Eastern Cordi llera, covering both regions with thick Cretaceous rift deposits (Marquillas et al., 2005)Rift structures are prone to reactivation during shortening (e.g., Carrera et al., 2006; Hongn et al., 2007)
In the Eastern Cordillera of the northern Puna, shortening may have preferentially activated the inherited Cretaceous riftrelated faults (e.g., Hongn et al., 2007; Carrera et al., 2006); syndepositional deformation in the Quebrada de los Colorados Formation is in line with this inference (del Papa et al., 2013)Although Cretaceous rift deposits are not present in the southern Puna (e.g., M arquillas et al., 2005), thermochronologic data document Cretaceous cooling of several ranges on the eastern margin (e.g., La Quebrada; Carrapa et al., 2014), suggesting that the rift shoulders may have extended onto the plateau
Although Cretaceous rift deposits are not present in the southern Puna (e.g., M arquillas et al., 2005), thermochronologic data document Cretaceous cooling of several ranges on the eastern margin (e.g., La Quebrada; Carrapa et al., 2014), suggesting that the rift shoulders may have extended onto the plateauRapid exhumation of the Sierra Chango Real, as suggested by 38–29 Ma AFT ages and relatively long ~13–14 µm mean track lengths (Coutand et al., 2001), may be a result of reactivation of rift­related faults
Alternatively, the southern Puna may indeed lack significant rift structures, but may instead dominantly host relict Paleozoic topography, supported by the observed Paleozoic zircon (U­Th­Sm)/He ages from the bedrock ranges in the southern Puna (Carrapa and DeCelles, 2015; Reiners et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2014)The lack of rift­related faults may position the southern Puna less favorably for accommodating large amounts of Cenozoic shortening, impeding the ~W­E propagation of Cenozoic deformation through the southern Central Andean Plateau (Fig
The lack of rift­related faults may position the southern Puna less favorably for accommodating large amounts of Cenozoic shortening, impeding the ~W­E propagation of Cenozoic deformation through the southern Central Andean Plateau (Fig14).
Sandstone modal composition, detrital zircon U­Pb ages, and modeled bedrock AFT data are consistent with the onset of sedimentary accumulation in multiple locations in the Southern Central Andean Plateau in the late Eocene to early OligoceneThese new data support the inference that the entire southern Puna was occupied by a regional, asymmetric sedimentary basin during the late Eocene to early Oligocene, bounded by topographic highs to the west in the Sierra Quebrada Honda, and to the east in the Sierra Chango Real (Zhou et al., 2016)

This basin was compartmentalized by basement­cored range uplift starting in the late Oligocene, propagating from west to east during the late Eocene to mid­late Miocene, with the exhumation of the eastern Sierra de Calalaste being refined to ca25–20 Ma in this study
We also document magmatic intrusion in the mid­late Miocene that, although it does not outcrop extensively at the surface, may nonetheless have reset the detrital AFT record in the Antofagasta de la Sierra strata; we suggest caution in interpreting similar data in other arc basinsOur results imply that the southern Puna could have been dynamically connected to the regional central Andean foreland basin that initiated as early as late Eocene, highlighting the potential for the flexural behavior of the lithosphere despite inherited crustal heterogeneities, such as preexisting deep­seated faults
