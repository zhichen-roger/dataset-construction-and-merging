Maximum depositional ages (MDAs) calculated from detrital zircon U-Pb and  detrital sanidine 40Ar/39Ar ages indicate that the most significant Paleogene fluvial system in the region, represented by the Bishop Conglomerate, e xisted from 36 to 27 MaThe abundance of red sandstone and gray limestone clasts, paleocurrent directions, and the large number of Grenville-age detrital zircons suggest that the Uinta Mountain Group (UMG) facies of the Bishop Conglomerate are tributaries that flowed radially away from the crest of the Uinta Mountains

New MDAs of Browns Park Formation sediments that unconformably overlie Neoproterozoic UMG rocks in westernmost Browns Park provide evidence for a younger (12–8 Ma) phase of extensional collapse of the eastern Uinta Mountains that was associated with 10–20 km of northwestward-directed lengthening of the Browns Park grabenThese data are compatible with models for two stages of post-Laramide epeirogenic uplift of the Uinta Mountains region, including post–12 Ma tectonism that set the stage for subsequent integration of the Green and Colorado Rivers after 8 Ma.

Since then, studies of the integration of the Green River and Colorado River systems have entertained more complex histories involving landscapes where modern river courses reflect linkage of internally drained basins and modification of paleoriver segments through a combination of piracy and downward integration (Blackwelder, 1934; Lucchitta, 1972; Pederson and Hadder, 2005; Aslan et al., 2014; Karlstrom et al., 2014; Kimbrough et al., 2015) coupled with Cenozoic uplift (Karlstrom et al., 2012).Reconstructing Cenozoic landscapes is commonly hampered by imprecise chronologies that rely on techniques such as paleomagnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphic correlation to land-mammal ages, and where available, radiometric dating of volcanic deposits

Reconstructing Cenozoic landscapes is commonly hampered by imprecise chronologies that rely on techniques such as paleomagnetostratigraphy, biostratigraphic correlation to land-mammal ages, and where available, radiometric dating of volcanic depositsThe application of detrital zircon U-Pb geochronology has provided another tool to constrain the ages of terrestrial clastic deposits (e.g., Stewart et al., 2001; Hodges et al., 2005; Gehrels et al., 2011; Fan et al., 2015), and newly emerging techniques such as detrital sanidine 40Ar/39Ar geochronology offer potentially even more precise means for establishing temporal frameworks for interpreting the provenance of terrestrial sediments and landscape evolution (Hereford et al., 2016; Karlstrom et al., 2017)

Differences in the distribution, paleocurrents, and composition of the Bishop Conglomerate UMG and FC facies suggest that these deposits represent tributaries and a mainstem river, respectively, of a latest Eocene to early Oligocene fluvial systemPrevious investigators have shown that the Bishop Conglomerate (UMG facies) represents a series of rivers that drained radially away from the Uinta Mountains (Bradley, 1936; Hansen, 1986)

This observation could indicate that the mainstem river flowed to the west, but this interpretation assumes that there has been no significant post-Oligocene deformation of the FC facies conglomerates.The presence of volcanic clasts and the abundance of rounded quartzite cobbles in the FC facies clearly show that the provenance of this facies differs from the UMG facies

However, the suggested ages (late Oligo cene to Pliocene) for these rivers are significantly younger than those proposed for the Bishop river system, and deposits of north-flowing rivers draining Laramide uplifts of the Colorado Rocky Mountains should contain granitic clastsFor these reasons, it is unlikely that the Bishop river system is part of the north-flowing river envisioned by Lucchitta et al

Hansen (1986) pointed out that this reversal in drainage direction clearly postdated the Bishop Conglomerate, and suggested that collapse of Oligocene topography, on the order of several hundred meters (Bradley, 1936; Hansen, 1986), initiatedthe formation of the Browns Park graben

In this scenario, late Oligocene to early Miocene Browns Park sediments began to accumulate in Browns Park due to a combination of changes in topography, disruption of the Bishop Conglomerate drainage networks, and the formation of the Browns Park graben, which provided accommodation space for Browns Park sedimentsBrowns Park Formation deposits are similarly concentrated in grabens elsewhere in northwestern Colorado and along the Colorado-Wyoming border (Izett, 1975; Luft, 1985; Buffler, 2003).
