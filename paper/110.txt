Detrital zircon ages indicate an Early Cretaceous episode of blueschist-facies metamorphism in southern Alaska: Implications for the Mesozoic paleogeography of the northern Cordillera1DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGICAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, EL PASO, TEXAS 79968, USA
A maximum depositional age (MDA) of 136 Ma demonstrates that the Liberty Creek schist was deposited long after the Early Jurassic cooling ages (196–185 Ma) recorded in other western Alaskan schist bodies containing blueschist-facies rocks, thus revealing two distinct blueschist-facies preservation events: an Early Jurassic event and a post–Early Cretaceous eventThis Early Cretaceous depositional age also indicates that there have been major reorganizations within this subduction complex because the Potter Creek assemblage (MDA of 169–156 Ma), directly south of the Liberty Creek schist, is an older but more shallowly exhumed assemblage
This Early Cretaceous depositional age also indicates that there have been major reorganizations within this subduction complex because the Potter Creek assemblage (MDA of 169–156 Ma), directly south of the Liberty Creek schist, is an older but more shallowly exhumed assemblageStrike-slip faulting has rearranged the accretionary complex by carrying the Potter Creek assemblage outboard and south of the Liberty Creek schist
The detrital zircon signature of the Liberty Creek schist and these distances to potential sources support models suggesting thousands of kilometers of strike-slip movement along the western Cordillera since Cretaceous time, consistent with the Baja–British Columbia hypothesis.Blueschist-facies rocks are among the most difficult rocks to date accurately
The southern Alaskan, 2000-km-long, Jurassic–Cretaceous paleo–convergent margin contains a series of fault-bounded schist bodies, all containing blueschist-facies rocks, that are located either against or in close proximity to the Border Ranges fault (Sisson and Onstott, 1986), which is the crystalline backstop to the accretionary complex (Plafker et al.,1994; Pavlis and Roeske, 2007; Fig

1A), and it represents a distinctly younger, Early Cretaceous blueschist-facies assemblageWe show that the detrital zircon signature of the Liberty Creek schist is distinct from other detrital signatures heretofore seen in this accretionary complex, and it may be representative of a missing part of the accretionary complex
Based on this detrital signature and similar conclusions from other authors (e.g., Umhoefer, 2003; Garver and Davidson, 2015; Hildebrand, 2015; Shaw and Johnston, 2016), we speculate that long-distance northward transport of terranes in the North American Cordillera during Late Cretaceous to Paleogene time was responsible for the current geographic location of the Liberty Creek schist, both along the paleomargin and among other terranes of this accretionary complex.Blueschist-facies rocks along the northernmost Cordilleran margin have been interpreted as exhumed products of a subduction zone with a similar polarity to the present-day margin (e.g., Carden et al., 1977; Forbes et
Throughout the Mesozoic, the northern Cordillera was characterized by the accretion of arc systems and subsequent strike-slip dispersal of elements of these arc-trench systems, leading to the observed terrane mosaic of the modern margin (Plafker et al., 1994).The outer Cordilleran assemblage is composed of an accreted arc–trench system, with the Wrangellia composite terrane representing the arc assemblage and the “Chugach terrane” representing the subduction complex (Fig
The Wrangellia composite terrane was assembled from three late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic terranes that may represent as many as three distinct oceanic arcs (Israel et al., 2014; Beranek et al., 2014)Overlap assemblages and plutonic ties establish that the Wrangellia composite terrane was partially assembled during the late Paleozoic (Israel et al., 2014; Beranek et al., 2014)
Overlap assemblages and plutonic ties establish that the Wrangellia composite terrane was partially assembled during the late Paleozoic (Israel et al., 2014; Beranek et al., 2014)The Peninsular terrane is the part of the Wrangellia composite terrane underlying most of southern Alaska (Plafker et al., 1994)
This arc terrane is either a younger separate oceanic arc that was amalgamated with Wrangellia as recently as Late Jurassic time (Clift et al., 2005), or it was constructed upon the combined Wrangellia-Alexander terrane by Late Jurassic time, when a cover sequence firmly establishes connections between these terranes (e.g., Coney et al., 1980; Plafker et al., 1994; Trop et al., 2002, 2005)The backstop to the subduction complex is the
Chugach terrane is composed of at least two elements: a Late Jurassic mélange dominated by pelagic to hemipelagic protoliths, and a middle Cretaceous clastic-dominated stratally disrupted assemblage (Amato andPavlis, 2010; Amato et al., 2013)
(2013) to propose a new nomenclature for these subduction assemblages: the term Chugach accretionary complex for the Chugach and Prince William terranes, and the terms Potter Creek assemblage and McHugh Creek assemblage for the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous parts of the Chugach accretionary complex, respectivelyThe blueschistfacies terranes do not directly fit into this terminology aside from local names for these units
The McHugh Creek assemblage, in turn, lies structurally above, and is gradational in age to, the Late Cretaceous coherent turbidite assemblage known in the ChugachMountains as the Valdez group or Chugach flysch (Plafker et al., 1994; Kochelek et al., 2011) and elsewhere termed the Valdez group flysch by Amato et al., (2013)
Based on cooling ages as old as the earliest Jurassic and structural position, these blueschist-facies rocks are widely cited as evidence for the initiation of subduction and the earliest accretion of the Chugach accretionary complex (e.g., Plafker et al., 1994; Pavlis and Roeske, 2007)Detrital zircons from the other members of the Chugach accretionary complex, however, are much younger than the available blueschist-facies cooling ages (Amato et al., 2013)
This observation, together with relationships in the adjacent arc on the Wrangellia composite terrane, is the principal evidence that a prolonged period of subduction erosion followed Early Jurassic accretion of the blueschist-facies rocks (Clift et al., 2005; Amato and Pavlis, 2010).The source of the clastic rocks that formed the protolith to the Potter Creek assemblage was the Early to Middle Jurassic Talkeetna-Bonanza arc or another coeval mid-Jurassic arc on the Wrangellia composite terrane, but the Potter Creek clastic rocks are mixed with pelagic to hemipelagic rocks that include radiolarian cherts with a wide range of depositional ages (e.g., Plafker et al., 1994; Amato et al., 2013)
The source of the clastic rocks that formed the protolith to the Potter Creek assemblage was the Early to Middle Jurassic Talkeetna-Bonanza arc or another coeval mid-Jurassic arc on the Wrangellia composite terrane, but the Potter Creek clastic rocks are mixed with pelagic to hemipelagic rocks that include radiolarian cherts with a wide range of depositional ages (e.g., Plafker et al., 1994; Amato et al., 2013)In contrast, the younger McHugh Creek assemblage and the Valdez group indicate a source primarily from the Coast Mountains batholith near SE Alaska and British Columbia, which is consistent with younger dextral strike-slip transport of these rocks to their present position in southern Alaska (Kochelek et al., 2011; Amato et al., 2013)
The structural history of the faulting is poorly understood, but it clearly included Cenozoic faulting (Pavlis and Roeske, 2007), suggesting a protracted structural historyThe Iceberg Lake schist is lithologically diverse and composed of rocks with variably developed metamorphic fabrics (Winkler et al., 1981b; Pavlis and Roeske, 2007)
Their study provides the only age constraint on the Iceberg Lake schist—a clear Early Jurassic cooling date of 186 Ma, indicating a likely correlation to the Kodiak and Seldovia blueschist-facies terranes, which have similar Early Jurassic (ca190 Ma) cooling dates (Roeske, 1986; Bradley et al., 1999).
The Tonsina ultramafic complex is widely recognized as the upper-mantle basement to the Early Jurassic Talkeetna arc of the Peninsular terrane (Burns, 1985; DeBari andColeman, 1989; Rioux et al., 2007, 2010; Hacker et al., 2008)
All of these dates were on whole rocks and scatter from 123 to 107 Ma, suggesting a mid-Cretaceous minimum ageNonetheless, these ages are difficult to interpret because with conventional K-Ar, particularly whole-rock ages, these dates could be too old from extraneous Ar or excessively young due to partial Ar loss during later events
For example, the region experienced a Paleogene thermal event (e.g., Sisson et al., 1989) that could have produced partial Ar loss from rocks that cooled originally in the JurassicAlthough we had similar problems producing clean mineral separations in these fine-grained rocks, the detrital signature of these rocks confirms they are distinct from the blueschist-facies rocks exposed to the west.
This sample was collected because a potential source for the Liberty Creek schist and McHugh complex is the Jurassic Chitina arc, exposed for more than 400 km along the Border Ranges fault from the Copper River into SE Alaska (Plafker et al., 1989; Roeske et al., 2003; Fig1A)
(1989) that there are two distinct blueschistfacies assemblages along the southern Alaskan margin, one in the Early Jurassic and another after the Early CretaceousPrior to this study, robust geochronologic data only existed for the three western blueschist-facies terranes (K, S, and I in Fig
1A), and these cooling ages indicate these three blueschist-facies terranes represent an Early Jurassic blueschistfacies assemblageOur 136 Ma MDA (Fig
Jurassic blueschist-facies assemblage because the protolith for the Liberty Creek schist was deposited at least 50 m.yafter the Early Jurassic blueschist-facies terranes had cooled through their 40Ar/39Ar and Rb-Sr (white mica) closure temperatures
after the Early Jurassic blueschist-facies terranes had cooled through their 40Ar/39Ar and Rb-Sr (white mica) closure temperaturesThus, the Liberty Creek schist must represent a distinctly younger blueschist-facies metamorphism event.
Creek schist, Hubbard Glacier schist, and Chichagof Island schist are the result of a second mid-Cretaceous blueschist-facies eventNonetheless, until more reliable cooling ages from all assemblages are available, this correlation should be considered tentative.
The Liberty Creek schist now lies to the south of, and structurally beneath, the Tonsina ultramafic complex, but it is north of a dextral strike-slip fault system that transported these rocks at least 130 km along strike in the latest Cretaceous–Paleogene (Pavlis and Roeske, 2007; Fig1B)
The ideal south-directed age progression within an accretionary complex is clearly violated in this area, with the Cretaceous Liberty Creek schist (MDA ca136 Ma; Figs
DR1) located inboard of the Jurassic Potter Creek assemblage (Fig1B), represented by samples 09CED02 and 09CED09 (Fig
Early Cretaceous, but later strike-slip systems juxtaposed these rocks with younger and older rocks that had been accreted at shallower depths and hundreds of kilometers along strikeThus, strike-slip motions have rearranged the accretionary complex by carrying the Potter Creek assemblage laterally along strike, outboard and south of the Tonsina complex and the Liberty Creek schist
The missing McHugh Creek assemblage rocks and the presence of the much younger Valdez group flysch structurally below and south of the Potter Creek assemblage strengthen the argument for strike-slip motions reorganizing the Chugach accretionary complex during Late Cretaceous dextral oblique subduction (Pavlis and Roeske, 2007).Paleogeographic Implications of the Liberty Creek Schist in the Cordillera
140 Ma and 130 Ma (Table DR1), indicating the Liberty Creek schist was sourced from an area dominated by Early Cretaceous rocks with zircon ages primarily in the 140–130 Ma rangeIn contrast, for the Chitina River sands, only 25 out of 83 zircons (30 percent) have ages within this range, and only one of these zircons is as young as the youngest ages in the Liberty Creek sample (Table DR1)
Further evidence for a dominance of Chitina Valley batholith sources is the scarcity of Paleozoic zircons in the sample (Fig2), which would be expected if a Wrangellian source were dominant (Fig.
Because igneous rocks of these ages in the northern Cordillera are rare, the simplest assumption is to use reasonable post–mid-Cretaceous right-lateral motions along the margin to infer a paleogeographyEstimates are variable for different structures, but if the Liberty Creek schist was transported as much as 600 km along the Border Ranges fault system (e.g., Pavlis and Roeske, 2007) as well as ~350 km along the Denali system (e.g., Lanphere, 1978; Lowey, 1998), then offsets on the order of 1000 km are reasonable
Like most of the northern Cordillera, the Coast plutonic complex experienced a magmatic lull from Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous time (ca140–110 Ma), but that lull varied spatially (e.g., Armstrong, 1988; Gehrels et al., 2009)
Nonetheless, although this belt is the right age to source the Liberty Creek schist, the plutons in this region were emplaced into Stikine and Yukon-Tanana basement, which not only contains older rocks than we see in the detrital zircons of the Liberty Creek schist, but also lies on the wrong side of the Coast shear zone, which is widely recognized as a mid-Cretaceous suture (Rubin and Saleeby, 1992)That is, an ocean basin separated these rocks in the Early Cretaceous, prior to mid-Cretaceous closure of the suture.
That is, an ocean basin separated these rocks in the Early Cretaceous, prior to mid-Cretaceous closure of the suture.One solution to this issue is the tectonic model of Gehrels et al
Schematic model of the northern Cordillera in the Late CretaceousThis model illustrates one hypothesis of how the eastern magmatic belt of the Coast plutonic complex could have supplied sediments to the Chugach accretionary complex
This model allows for open ocean basins at the same time the Bella Coola area, the 140–130 Ma Firvale suite, was a magmatic arc source to the Early Cretaceous trench (Fig5; for a full explanation of this reorganization of the Coast plutonic complex, see Gehrels et al., 2009).
Figure 2 shows that 10CED14, as with most Chugach accretionary complex samples, contains a minimal amount of Paleozoic zirconsThis lack of Paleozoic material is the basis of the “direct arc to trench” assumption we make, allowing us to assume our MDA is representative of the age of accretion for the Chugach accretionary complex
This lack of Paleozoic material is the basis of the “direct arc to trench” assumption we make, allowing us to assume our MDA is representative of the age of accretion for the Chugach accretionary complexThe minimal amount of Paleozoic zircons in sample 10CED14 suggests the Firvale suite was not the source for the Liberty Creek schist.
The minimal amount of Paleozoic zircons in sample 10CED14 suggests the Firvale suite was not the source for the Liberty Creek schist.An alternative source for 140–130 Ma rocks within the North American Cordillera is the Guerrero superterrane of central Mexico (Fig
The Guerrero terrane was a complex Jurassic–Cretaceous arc system that was active during this interval (Umhoefer, 2003; Fig6A) and eventually accreted to the Mexican margin in the Late Cretaceous (TalaveraMendoza et al., 2007; Fig
6A) and eventually accreted to the Mexican margin in the Late Cretaceous (TalaveraMendoza et al., 2007; Fig6B)
This is consistent with the lack of Precambrian zircon in the Liberty Creek schist and the older constituents of the Chugach terrane (Amato et al., 2013; Fig6B).
The Wrangellia composite terrane likely was an offshore arc system in Late Jurassic–earliest Cretaceous time, and paleomagnetic data have consistently shown that it was at low paleolatitudes at this time, consistentwith a location in southwestern North America (Coney et al., 1980; Oldow et al., 1989; Irving et al., 1996; Johnston, 2001; Stamatakos et al., 2001; Shaw and Johnston, 2016)
A Guerrero terrane source for the Liberty Creek schist is consistent with the southern option for Baja–British Columbia and the Early Cretaceous paleogeographic model of Umhoefer (2003)Results by Garver and Davidson (2015) and this study therefore provide evidence that complements paleomagnetic data for large-scale, post–Early Cretaceous northward transport of the Wrangellia composite terrane and the southern option for Baja–British Columbia.
Results by Garver and Davidson (2015) and this study therefore provide evidence that complements paleomagnetic data for large-scale, post–Early Cretaceous northward transport of the Wrangellia composite terrane and the southern option for Baja–British Columbia.At least two examples of blueschist-facies preservation events are visible along the south Alaskan margin
The first blueschist-facies preservation event was in the Early Jurassic and produced the blueschist-faciesFigure 6
(B) Early Cretaceous paleogeographic model of the arc successions of the Guerrero and western Mixteca terranes of western MexicoThis model illustrates how the arcs that make up the Guerrero terrane could have deposited zircons to a trench, which became the source of the Liberty Creek schist, with minimal input of detrital zircons from the craton
