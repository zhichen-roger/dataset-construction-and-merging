Jurassic sandstones on the Colorado Plateau have been variably bleached through interaction with hydrocarbon-bearing solutions or other reducing agentsDeformation bands in the Navajo Sandstone have avariety of colors in comparison with the host rock color that indicate the timing of bleaching relative to deformation-band formation
Flat-lying, red Mesozoic sedimentary beds of the Colorado Plateau region of southern Utah are interrupted by Laramide (Late Cretaceous to middle Eocene) structures and by widespread bleaching of previously red sandstoneThe Laramide structures of the Utah study area are the Kaibab, Circle Cliffs, Monument, and San Rafael swell uplifts, together with the great monoclines on the eastern

The Jurassic system on the Colorado Plateau in southern Utah contains three prominent and well-exposed eolian unitsThe oldest is the fine-grained Wingate Sandstone (Figure 2) (Blakey et al., 1988; Blakey, 1994)
Above the Wingate Sandstone, the Lower Jurassic Navajo Sandstone and its related equivalents, the Nugget Sandstone of northern Utah and Wyoming and the Aztec Sandstone of Nevada, form the largest eolian duneseadepositinNorthAmerica(Blakeyetal.,1988; Peterson and Turner-Peterson, 1989; Blakey, 1994; Peterson, 1994)In the study area, the Navajo Sandstone (Figure 2) is a well-sorted, fine-grained quartz arenite, dominated by large-scale eolian cross-stratification (as much as a few tens of meters)
The Middle Jurassic Entrada Sandstone (Figure 2)isthethird,fine-grainedsandstone,dune-seadeposit (Kocurek, 1981; Kocurek and Dott, 1983).Several thin-bedded, siltstone-dominated units are relatively low-permeability aquitards that separate the higher permeability eolian units.
The Jurassic, eolian sandstones were likely ubiquitously red soon after deposition in oxidizing environments and early burialHowever, large areas of Navajo, Entrada, and Wingate sandstones show extensive bleaching because of reduction and removal of iron (Beitler et al., 2003, in press)
Permian White Rim Sandstone was bleached by invasion of oil (Huntoon et al., 1999)The Nugget Sandstone,

Major Triassic unconformities (Tr-1 and Tr-2) and Jurassic unconformities (J-0 through J-5) are indicated (Pipiringos, and O’Sullivan, 1978).a Navajo equivalent, is bleached to white and pink in the Painter oil field in the Wyoming thrust belt (Lamb, 1980)
The brilliant red sandstone, sandy shale, and shale of the Triassic Chugwater of Wyoming and southern Montana is bleached along crests of minor folds and on flanks of the main mountain uplift, where bleaching is associated with oil saturation (Moulton, 1926)The Permian Lyons Sandstone in the Denver basin, Colorado, is gray when associated with producing oil fields and red in nonpetroliferous areas (Levandowski et al., 1973).
The Permian Lyons Sandstone in the Denver basin, Colorado, is gray when associated with producing oil fields and red in nonpetroliferous areas (Levandowski et al., 1973).Bleaching by petroleum is also demonstrated in laboratorypyrolysisofwater-rock-oilmixturesofShebl andSurdam(1996).Thecolorchangedinthehematitic Pennsylvanian Tensleep Sandstone dune facies from original bright or dark red to light pink, white, gray, or dark gray

Deformation bands are abundant tectonic structures in Mesozoic sandstone units of the western United StatesAydin et al
Deformation bands that occur in Jurassic sandstone outcrops from localities in Utah and southeastern NevadaThe color of the deformation bands indicates the nature of solution interaction
The focus of this mineralogical and geochemical study is white deformation bands in red Jurassic Navajo Sandstone from the southern part of the Waterpocket fold illustrated by seven sandstone-deformation-band pairs (Figure 4)The samples were collected from the Surprise Canyon to Headquarters Canyon area of Capitol Reef National Park (Figure 1B)
The Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, host rock for the deformation bands, is a fine-grained, well-sorted, wellroundedarenite.Mostofthesandgrainsarequartz,but K-feldspar grains (3.17–7.50 percent) are scattered throughoutThe sand grains are mostly 0.1–0.25 mm (0.004– 0.010 in.) in size and are commonly coated with 2– 4-mm-thick illite and hematite (Figure 6B)
On a broad, regional scale, the Jurassic eolian sandstones and, to a lesser extent, associated fluvial and sabkha deposits are largely aquifers and reservoir rocks, separated from petroleum source rocks below by confining aquitards of the fine-grained Triassic Chinle and Moenkopi formationsHigh-angle reverse faults associated with the Laramide monoclines are potential fluid pathways for communication of hydrocarbons into the red sandstone.
