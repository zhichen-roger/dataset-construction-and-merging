ABSTRACT: Facies analysis of the Upper Cretaceous (Turonian) Ferron Sandstone in the western Henry Mountains of southcentral Utah, U.S.A., indicates sediment accumulation in a series of flood-dominated, marine current- and wave-influenced, deltasTwelve lithofacies are recognized: 1
The Holocene and modern Burdekin River Delta of NE Australia is considered a close planform, process, and facies analog for the Ferron Notom deltasThe Burdekin Delta facies assemblage is vertically and laterally heterogeneous, despite being the product of a consistent array of environmental controls
Deltaic deposits of the Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway (WIS) Basin of North America are in places spectacularly and continuously exposed in lengthy cliff sections, particularly in the arid landscapes of the modern SW USAAmong these deltaic units is the lower Upper Cretaceous (Turonian) Ferron Sandstone Member of the Mancos Shale (Fig
Among these deltaic units is the lower Upper Cretaceous (Turonian) Ferron Sandstone Member of the Mancos Shale (Fig1; Ryer 2004)

Ultimate controls on the accumulation of the Ferron Sandstone and the Upper Cretaceous strata of the WIS in general are still debated, with advocates of both tectonic and eustatic controls (e.g., Kamola and Huntoon 1995; Yoshida et al1998; Van Wagoner 1998; Liu et al
2008) and from other Cretaceous units in the WIS (e.g., Levey 1985)Slopes on the proximal delta front were evidently gentler than those on some mouth-bar fronts, from the lack of high-angle clinoform sets.
Such relationships have been noted in other Cretaceous successions of interpreted deltaic origin from the WIS (e.g., Kamola and Van Wagoner 1995; Gardner et al2004; Gani and
Potentially analogous Holocene deltas include the Brazos River Delta of southern USA (Rodriguez et al2000), the Po River Delta of northeast Italy (Cattaneo et al
In terms of the facies assemblage and its characteristics, the modern Burdekin River Delta of NE Australia is herein proposed as a close process, facies, and planform analogue to the Cretaceous Notom deltas (Fig15)
(2005b) found that the Holocene delta platform was constructed mainly of distributary-channel and mouth-bar sandsAccordingly, it has been reclassified as a flood-dominated delta with subordinate wave and tidal influences (Fielding et al
One major line of evidence in support of a flood control on mouth-bar initiation and construction is the fact that Holocene Burdekin mouth-bar sands are nearly all sharp-based (Fielding et al2005a)
Accordingly, a sand isolith map for the Holocene Burdekin Delta shows a series of depocenters with some planform asymmetry (Fielding et al2005b)
The Ferron Sandstone Member of the Mancos Shale in the western Henry Mountains of south-central Utah records repeated progradation of flood-dominated deltas (so-called ‘‘Notom Delta’’ of previous workers)into a shallow sea of the Cretaceous Western Interior Basin of North AmericaFacies analysis indicates a suite of delta-top, delta-front, prodelta, and marine shelf deposits, which are arranged in crudely coarsening-upward cycles in the lower half of the Ferron Sandstone
Indeed, the Holocene and modern Burdekin River Delta is considered an excellent planform, process, and facies analog for the Ferron Notom deltasDeltaic complexes that are asymmetric in planform need not be constructed primarily from deflection of beach ridges, but as in the case of the Notom Ferron Sandstone, and modern Po and Burdekin Deltas, may reflect directional growth of delta lobes
Rather, a single model which incorporates a degree of natural heterogeneity such as is exemplified by the Holocene Burdekin River Delta may be a more parsimonious explanation for such intervals.The stratigraphy of the Ferron Sandstone in the depositional strike orientation (north–south) shows a series of laterally extensive delta front sandstone bodies the boundaries of which are concordant with the top of the unit and with a series of bentonite beds in the underlying Tununk Shale
