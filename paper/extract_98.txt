320 Ma and Neoproterozoic clusters for the Amotapes metasediments show significant similarities along the strike of the metamorphic belt, thus defining a common metasedimentary origin, and can be compared with previously dated rocks from the Eastern Cordillera of PeruThese strong similarities demonstrate the presence of a wide, polyphased metamorphic belt that includes the western parts of the Eastern Cordillera, the northern section of the Occidental Cordillera of Peru, and the Amotapes Massif

In this study, we propose a source-to-sink analysis in SW Ecuador and NW Peru using a comparison of the detrital zircon record within forearc Cenozoic strata and the ages of metamorphosed Paleozoic sediments of the Amotapes Massif in NW Peru.Detrital zircon age spectra are controlled mainly by the presence of synsedimentary igneous activity, the potential of zircon grain preser vation, and the degree of incorporation of older zircon grains into the sedimentary record (Cawood et al., 2012)

There is a major debate on whether Andean construction took place during several pulses during the Cenozoic or whether most of its topographic growth took place recentlyHowever, a regional model describing uplift during different periods between the Late Cretaceous and the Eocene, followed by more significant uplift since the late Miocene and even the Pliocene, has gained acceptance (Gregory- Wodzicki, 2000; Garzione et al., 2008; Hoorn et al., 2010).

Besides the Mesoproterozoic Grenville- Sunsas (1.3–1.0 Ga) event coeval with the accretion of the Arequipa-Antofalla basement (Fig1A; Loewy et al., 2004), the main pre- Andean orogenic events (as they are defined in the Central-South Andes) can be roughly divided into the events related to the Pampean orogeny (600–580 Ma to 520–490 Ma; Ramos, 2008; Steenken et al., 2011; Casquet et al., 2012; von Gosen et al., 2014) and those associated with Ordovician subduction (i.e., the Famatinian belt; Loewy et al., 2004; Rapela et al., 1998).

The first age constraint on the Amotapes protolith came from a Triassic granitoid, from which a single zircon core gave a Neop rotero zoic age of 546 ± 3 Ma, and this was attributed to recycling of material originally derived from the Amazonian craton (Noble et al., 1997).Paleomagnetic studies suggest that the massif underwent clockwise rotation of 110° for late Carboniferous units, and 35° for younger Cretaceous units (Mourier et al., 1988)

In the Peruvian Andes, this extensive Neoproterozoic–Early Cambrian detrital record may be related to a felsic-intermediate magmatic source supposedly having an arc affinity that was formed by at least by 640 Ma (Cardona et al., 2009)The 650–550 Ma age component has been tentatively related to the existence of a pre-orogenic phase of the Pampean subductionrelated magmatism in this section of the Andes, with the products of this magmatic arc being currently buried beneath the modern Andes volcanic and sedimentary products (Chew et al., 2007)

It has been suggested that sedimentation at the proto-Pacific border in this basin was not only the result of accumulation of sediments derived from the Gondwana margin in a passivemargin setting, but that they were also sourced from evolving orogenic events when the South American and African cratons collided during the late Neoproterozoic (Adams et al., 2011).The abundance of detrital zircon grains obtained in this study intuitively defines a late Neoprotero zoic magmatic arc in this section of the Northern Andes

Furthermore, it is unlikely that Neoproterozoic zircon grains originated from cratonic (e.g., Pan African–Braziliano) belts, which are mostly located in SE South America (Fig1A), thus suggesting the onset of significant magmatic activity in the Northern Andes (south Ecuador and north Peru) around 570– 560 Ma

Opinions diverge about the autochthonous or allochthonous origin of the metamorphosed Paleozoic series in the Eastern Cordillera of Ecua dor (e.g., Litherland et al., 1994; Pratt et al., 2005) Although age and lithology similarities for the Paleozoic series outcropping in the Amotapes Massif and Eastern Cordilleras have been proposed in the past, the Amotapes Massif has also been considered as an allochthonous chain accreted to the continental margin during the Late Cretaceous (Mourier et al., 1988; Winter et al., 2010)An autochthonous origin for the Amotapes Massif is preferred based on our data set, especially because of the similarities between age clusters and maximum depositional ages between Amotapes rocks and those outcropping in the Eastern Cordilleras of Ecuador and Peru

Younger exhumation ages (late Miocene) have also been obtained for the Amotapes in north Peru (Espurt et al., 2014)The difficulty in proposing a wellconstrained exhumation scenario for this part of the Andes may arise because: (1) there are no real constraints for the net surface uplift during each cooling period, and (2) the accumulation of Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary arc intrusive and volcanic rocks in the Occidental Cordillera of Ecuador and Peru may complicate the analysis of the cooling related to exhumation

Independent of the thermochronological records, the provenance analysis presented in this study suggests that the Occidental Cordilleras of Ecuador and the Amotapes or related terrains (e.g., the Peruvian Occidental Cordillera) were uplifted during the early onset of forearc basins in Paleocene times and that they represented drainage divides until at least the late Miocene (age of the younger sediments analyzed in this study)At a regional scale, this scenario is in a good agreement with recently published works dealing with chain-forearc relationships in terms of uplift and resulting sourcing

Whether most of the uplift (rock or surface uplift) of the Occidental Cordilleras is recent or not, the altitude reached by the Occidental Cordillera at the onset of the forearc basins is high enough to represent a drainage divide that persisted through all of the CenozoicThis scenario is in disagreement with previous models that propose direct connections between the Pacific Ocean and the intermountain basins in Ecuador (Hungerbühler et al., 2002) and between the forearc and Amazonia (Hessler and Fildani, 2015).
