Detrital monazites from the same sediments record the complete Paleozoic collisional history of the Appalachian orogen (including the Alleghanian event) as well as the main events for the Grenville basementThe authors point out that the younger signals are only partially recorded in rims of detrital zircons, and may be missed without careful imaging and domain sampling in a strictly detrital zircon approach
